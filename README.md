We present novel techniques for the verification of threshold automata, based on well-structured transition systems, that allow us to extend the expressiveness of both the computational model and the specifications that can be verified. In particular, we extend the model to allow decrements and resets of shared variables, possibly on cycles, and the specifications to general coverability. While these extensions of the model in general lead to undecidability, our algorithms provide a semi-decision procedure. We demonstrate the benefit of our extensions by showing that we can model complex round-based algorithms such as the phase king consensus algorithm and the Red Belly Blockchain protocol (published in 2019), and verify them fully automatically for the first time. |
|**2024-06-28**|**Quantum-Enhanced Secure Approval Voting Protocol**|Saiyam Sakhuja et.al.|[2406.19730](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19730)| In a world where elections touch every aspect of society, the need for secure voting is paramount. Traditional safeguards, based on classical cryptography, rely on complex math problems like factoring large numbers. However, quantum computing is changing the game. Recent advances in quantum technology suggest that classical cryptographic methods may not be as secure as we thought. This paper introduces a quantum voting protocol, a blend of quantum principles (entanglement and superposition), blockchain technology, and digital signatures, all powered by $\log_2{n}$ qubits, and designed for approval voting with n candidates. The result is a symphony of security features - binding, anonymity, non-reusability, verifiability, eligibility, and fairness - that chart a new course for voting security. The real world beckons, as we tested this protocol on IBM quantum hardware, achieving impressively low error rates of just 1.17% in a four-candidate election. |
|**2024-06-27**|**Commodification of Compute**|Jesper Kristensen et.al.|[2406.19261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261)| The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute. |
|**2024-06-27**|**Towards Credential-based Device Registration in DApps for DePINs with ZKPs**|Jonathan Heiss et.al.|[2406.19042](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19042)| Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINS) are secured and governed by blockchains but beyond crypto-economic incentives, they lack measures to establish trust in participating devices and their services. The verification of relevant device credentials during device registration helps to overcome this problem. However, on-chain verification in decentralized applications (dApp) discloses potentially confidential device attributes whereas off-chain verification introduces undesirable trust assumptions. In this paper, we propose a credential-based device registration (CDR) mechanism that verifies device credentials on the blockchain and leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to protect confidential device attributes from being disclosed. We characterize CDR for DePINs, present a general system model, and technically evaluate CDR using zkSNARKs with Groth16 and Marlin. Our experiments give first insights into performance impacts and reveal a tradeoff between the applied proof systems. |
|**2024-06-27**|**A Treatment of EIP-1559: Enhancing Transaction Fee Mechanism through Nth-Price Auction**|Kun Li et.al.|[2406.18957](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18957)| With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, the transaction fee mechanism (TFM) in blockchain systems has become a prominent research topic. An ideal TFM should satisfy user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and miner-user side contract proofness ( $c$-SCP). However, state-of-the-art works either fail to meet these three properties simultaneously or only satisfy them under certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a burning $N$-price auction TFM named BNP. This mechanism divides the transaction fee into a base fee, which is burned, and a priority fee, which is allocated to miners. Theoretical proofs and experimental analyses demonstrate that, even under conditions of significant transaction congestion, this mechanism satisfies UIC, MIC, and $c$ -SCP simultaneously. Furthermore, the BNP mechanism is not constrained by the type of blockchain consensus, making it widely applicable. |
|**2024-06-26**|**From Tweet to Theft: Tracing the Flow of Stolen Cryptocurrency**|Guglielmo Cola et.al.|[2406.18503](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18503)| This paper presents a case study of a cryptocurrency scam that utilized coordinated and inauthentic behavior on Twitter. In 2020, 143 accounts sold by an underground merchant were used to orchestrate a fake giveaway. Tweets pointing to a fake blog post lured victims into sending Uniswap tokens (UNI) to designated addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, with the false promise of receiving more tokens in return. Using one of the scammer's addresses and leveraging the transparency and immutability of the Ethereum blockchain, we traced the flow of stolen funds through various addresses, revealing the tactics adopted to obfuscate traceability. The final destination of the funds involved two deposit addresses. The first, managed by a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, was likely associated with the scammer's own account on that platform and saw deposits exceeding $3.5 million. The second address was linked to a popular cryptocurrency swap service. These findings highlight the critical need for more stringent measures to verify the source of funds and prevent illicit activities. |
|**2024-06-26**|**Costly Signalling in DAOs**|Darcy W. E. Allen et.al.|[2406.18457](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18457)| Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are a new type of digital organisation that uses blockchain infrastructure (e.g. smart contracts, tokens) to coordinate a group of people around a shared mission. Like all organisations, DAOs must attract sources of funding and other resources, and discover and retain a talented community and workforce. To do this, they must signal their true quality. Yet the characteristics of the environment that DAOs operate in (pseudonymous actors, global scale, permissionless entry and exit) makes this difficult. We apply costly signalling theory to explore the information asymmetry problem in DAOs and some of the strategies (behaviours and investments) and institutional solutions (including better signalling mechanisms) that have evolved to solve this problem. |
|**2024-06-26**|**New intelligent empowerment for digital transformation**|Peng Yifeng et.al.|[2406.18440](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18440)| This study proposes an innovative evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs) specifically designed to measure the digital transformation (DT) process of enterprises. By analyzing the annual reports of 4407 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from 2005 to 2022, a comprehensive set of DT indicators was constructed. The findings revealed that DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, however, different digital technologies exhibit varying effects on financial performance. Specifically, blockchain technology has a relatively limited positive impact on financial performance. In addition, this study further discovered that DT can promote the growth of financial performance by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. This study provides a novel DT evaluation tool for the academic community, while also expanding the application scope of generative artificial intelligence technology in economic research. |
|**2024-06-26**|**Blockchain Based Zero-Knowledge Proof of Location in IoT**|Wei Wu et.al.|[2406.18389](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18389)| With the development of precise positioning technology, a growing number of location-based services (LBSs) facilitate people's life. Most LBSs require proof of location (PoL) to prove that the user satisfies the service requirement, which exposes the user's privacy. In this paper, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of location (zk-PoL) protocol to better protect the user's privacy. With the zk-PoL protocol, the user can choose necessary information to expose to the server, so that hierarchical privacy protection can be achieved. The evaluation shows that the zk-PoL has excellent security to resist main attacks, moreover the computational efficiency is independent of input parameters and the zk-PoL is appropriate to delay-tolerant LBSs. |
|**2024-06-26**|**Analysis of Channel Uncertainty in Trusted Wireless Services via Repeated Interactions**|Bingwen Chen et.al.|[2406.18204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18204)| The coexistence of heterogeneous sub-networks in 6G poses new security and trust concerns and thus calls for a perimeterless-security model. Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) provides a trust-building approach via repeated interactions rather than relying on pre-established trust or central authentication. Such a trust-building process naturally supports dynamic trusted services across various service providers (SP) without the need for perimeter-based authentications; however, it remains vulnerable to environmental and system unreliability such as wireless channel uncertainty. In this study, we investigate channel unreliability in the trust-building framework based on repeated interactions for secure wireless services. We derive specific requirements for achieving cooperation between SP and client via a repeated game model and illustrate the implications of channel unreliability on sustaining trusted access services. We consider the framework optimization to guarantee SP-client cooperation, given a worst-case channel condition. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of cooperation region to represent the robustness of the trust-building process and explore the maximum cooperation area to enhance service resilience. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate the system performance over fading channels and verify our results. |
|**2024-06-26**|**A Communication Satellite Servises Based Decentralized Network Protocol**|Xiao Yan et.al.|[2406.18032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18032)| In this paper, we present a decentralized network protocol, Space Network Protocol, based on Communication Satellite Services. The protocol outlines a method for distributing information about the status of satellite communication services across the entire blockchain network, facilitating fairness and transparency in all communication services. Our primary objective is to standardize the services delivered by all satellite networks under the communication satellite protocol. This standard remains intact regardless of potential unreliability associated with the satellites or the terminal hardware. We proposed PoD (Proof of Distribution) to verify if the communication satellites are online and PoF (Proof of Flow) to authenticate the actual data flow provided by the communication satellites. In addition, we also proposed PoM (Proof of Mesh) to verify if the communication satellites have successfully meshed together. Utilizing zero-knowledge proof and multi-party cryptographic computations, we can evaluate the service provisioning parameters of each satellite, even in the presence of potential terminal or network node fraud. This method offers technical support for the modeling of distributed network services. |
|**2024-06-29**|**Protecting the 'Stop Using My Data' Right through Blockchain-assisted Evidence Generation**|Fan Zhang et.al.|[2406.17694](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17694)| In order to provide personalized services to users, Internet-based platforms collect and utilize user-generated behavioral data. Although the 'stop using my data' right should be a fundamental data right, which allows individuals to request their personal data to be no longer utilized by online platforms, the existing preventive data protection measures (e.g., cryptographic data elimination, differential privacy) are unfortunately not applicable. This work aims to develop the first Evidence Generation Framework for deterring post-acquisition data right violations. We formulated the 'stop using my data' problem, which captures a vantage facet of the multi-faceted notion of 'right to be forgotten'. We designed and implemented the first blockchain-assisted system to generate evidence for deterring the violations of the 'stop using my data' right. Our system employs a novel two-stage evidence generation protocol whose efficacy is ensured by a newly proposed Lemma. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study on recommendation systems with systematic evaluation experiments using two real-world datasets: the measured success rate exceeds 99%. |
|**2024-06-25**|**VR-based Blockchain-enabled Data Visualization Framework For Manufacturing Industry**|Nitol Saha et.al.|[2406.17207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17207)| This research proposes a blockchain-based data visualization framework integrated with VR to get manufacturing insights. This framework is implemented at the testbed of the Future Factories Lab at the University of South Carolina. The proposed system aims to enhance understanding, analysis, and decision-making processes by immersing users in a VR environment where complex manufacturing data stored using blockchain is translated into intuitive and interactive representations. The project focuses on two main components: blockchain and VR. Hyperledger Fabric is employed to establish a blockchain network, recording data from the Future Factories testbed. This system captures information from various sources, such as potentiometers on robot grippers to measure grip positioning, load cells to gauge pressure, emergency stop buttons, temperature, speed, and vibration sensors on the conveyors. Whenever predefined conditions are met, pertinent data, including sensor ID, timestamp, value, cause, and importance, is securely recorded in the blockchain, signaling the occurrence of a defect within the cell. Data retrieved from the blockchain system is accessed through 'GET' API requests. A VR application is developed using a cross-platform Unity game engine to visualize the data retrieved from the blockchain database. Meta Quest 3 is used as the targeted Head Mounted VR device. The VR application has two C# scripts: one script to query blockchain data using 'GET' API calls and another script converts the JSON object to text data to visualize in the VR system. The proposed system leverages blockchain technology and VR visualization to deliver immersive, actionable insights using secure data transmission. By embracing the proposed framework, manufacturers can unlock new potential for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in today's increasingly complex and interconnected manufacturing workplace. |
|**2024-06-24**|**Robust Zero Trust Architecture: Joint Blockchain based Federated learning and Anomaly Detection based Framework**|Shiva Raj Pokhrel et.al.|[2406.17172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17172)| This paper introduces a robust zero-trust architecture (ZTA) tailored for the decentralized system that empowers efficient remote work and collaboration within IoT networks. Using blockchain-based federated learning principles, our proposed framework includes a robust aggregation mechanism designed to counteract malicious updates from compromised clients, enhancing the security of the global learning process. Moreover, secure and reliable trust computation is essential for remote work and collaboration. The robust ZTA framework integrates anomaly detection and trust computation, ensuring secure and reliable device collaboration in a decentralized fashion. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying user contexts, using unsupervised clustering to detect novel anomalies, like zero-day attacks. To ensure a reliable and scalable trust computation, we develop an algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying user contexts by employing incremental anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify and share local and global anomalies between nodes. Future directions include scalability improvements, Dirichlet process for advanced anomaly detection, privacy-preserving techniques, and the integration of post-quantum cryptographic methods to safeguard against emerging quantum threats. |
|**2024-06-24**|**Competitive Policies for Online Collateral Maintenance**|Ghada Almashaqbeh et.al.|[2406.17121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17121)| Layer-two blockchain protocols emerged to address scalability issues related to fees, storage cost, and confirmation delay of on-chain transactions. They aggregate off-chain transactions into a fewer on-chain ones, thus offering immediate settlement and reduced transaction fees. To preserve security of the underlying ledger, layer-two protocols often work in a collateralized model; resources are committed on-chain to backup off-chain activities. A fundamental challenge that arises in this setup is determining a policy for establishing, committing, and replenishing the collateral in a way that maximizes the value of settled transactions.   In this paper, we study this problem under two settings that model collateralized layer-two protocols. The first is a general model in which a party has an on-chain collateral C with a policy to decide on whether to settle or discard each incoming transaction. The policy also specifies when to replenish C based on the remaining collateral value. The second model considers a discrete setup in which C is divided among k wallets, each of which is of size C/k, such that when a wallet is full, and so cannot settle any incoming transactions, it will be replenished. We devise several online policies for these models, and show how competitive they are compared to optimal (offline) policies that have full knowledge of the incoming transaction stream. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and formulate online competitive policies for collateral and wallet management in the blockchain setting. |
|**2024-06-24**|**ammBoost: State Growth Control for AMMs**|Nicholas Michel et.al.|[2406.17094](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17094)| Automated market makers (AMMs) are a form of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues. In this paper, we address the on-chain storage overhead problem of AMMs by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs while preserving correctness and security of the underlying AMM. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate its performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 94.53% and the chain growth by at least 80%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice. |
|**2024-06-24**|**A Multi-Party, Multi-Blockchain Atomic Swap Protocol with Universal Adaptor Secret**|Shengewei You et.al.|[2406.16822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16822)| The increasing complexity of digital asset transactions across multiple blockchains necessitates a robust atomic swap protocol that can securely handle more than two participants. Traditional atomic swap protocols, including those based on adaptor signatures, are vulnerable to malicious dropout attacks, which break atomicity and compromise the security of the transaction. This paper presents a novel multi-party atomic swap protocol that operates almost entirely off-chain, requiring only a single on-chain transaction for finalization. Our protocol leverages Schnorr-like signature verification and a universal adaptor secret to ensure atomicity and scalability across any number of participants and blockchains without the need for smart contracts or trusted third parties. By addressing key challenges such as collusion attacks and malicious dropouts, our protocol significantly enhances the security and efficiency of multi-party atomic swaps. Our contributions include the first scalable, fully off-chain protocol for atomic swaps involving any number of participants, adding zero overhead to native blockchains, and providing a practical and cost-effective solution for decentralized asset exchanges. |
|**2024-06-24**|**Towards Communication-Efficient Peer-to-Peer Networks**|Khalid Hourani et.al.|[2406.16661](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16661)| We focus on designing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks that enable efficient communication. Over the last two decades, there has been substantial algorithmic research on distributed protocols for building P2P networks with various desirable properties such as high expansion, low diameter, and robustness to a large number of deletions. A key underlying theme in all of these works is to distributively build a \emph{random graph} topology that guarantees the above properties. Moreover, the random connectivity topology is widely deployed in many P2P systems today, including those that implement blockchains and cryptocurrencies. However, a major drawback of using a random graph topology for a P2P network is that the random topology does not respect the \emph{underlying} (Internet) communication topology. This creates a large \emph{propagation delay}, which is a major communication bottleneck in modern P2P networks.   In this paper, we work towards designing P2P networks that are communication-efficient (having small propagation delay) with provable guarantees. Our main contribution is an efficient, decentralized protocol, $\textsc{Close-Weaver}$ , that transforms a random graph topology embedded in an underlying Euclidean space into a topology that also respects the underlying metric. We then present efficient point-to-point routing and broadcast protocols that achieve essentially optimal performance with respect to the underlying space. |
|**2024-06-24**|**Soley: Identification and Automated Detection of Logic Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts Using Large Language Models**|Majd Soud et.al.|[2406.16244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16244)| Modern blockchain, such as Ethereum, supports the deployment and execution of so-called smart contracts, autonomous digital programs with significant value of cryptocurrency. Executing smart contracts requires gas costs paid by users, which define the limits of the contract's execution. Logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to financial losses, and are often the root cause of high-impact cyberattacks. Our objective is threefold: (i) empirically investigate logic vulnerabilities in real-world smart contracts extracted from code changes on GitHub, (ii) introduce Soley, an automated method for detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) examine mitigation strategies employed by smart contract developers to address these vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios. We obtained smart contracts and related code changes from GitHub. To address the first and third objectives, we qualitatively investigated available logic vulnerabilities using an open coding method. We identified these vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies. For the second objective, we extracted various logic vulnerabilities, applied preprocessing techniques, and implemented and trained the proposed Soley model. We evaluated Soley along with the performance of various LLMs and compared the results with the state-of-the-art baseline on the task of logic vulnerability detection. From our analysis, we identified nine novel logic vulnerabilities, extending existing taxonomies with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we introduced several mitigation strategies extracted from observed developer modifications in real-world scenarios. Our Soley method outperforms existing methods in automatically identifying logic vulnerabilities. Interestingly, the efficacy of LLMs in this task was evident without requiring extensive feature engineering. |

|**2024-06-23**|**Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Localization in an IoT Environment**|Guglielmo Zocca et.al.|[2406.16182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16182)| The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent in various applications, such as healthcare and logistics. One significant service of IoT technologies that is essential for these applications is localization. The goal of this service is to determine the precise position of a specific target. The localization data often needs to be private, accessible only to specific entities, and must maintain authenticity and integrity to ensure trustworthiness. IoT technology has evolved significantly, with Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology enhancing localization speed and precision. However, IoT device security remains a concern, as devices can be compromised or act maliciously. Furthermore, localization data is typically stored centrally, which can also be a point of vulnerability. Our approach leverages the features of a permissioned blockchain, specifically Hyperledger Fabric, to address these challenges. Hyperledger Fabric's collection feature ensures data privacy, and its smart contracts (chaincode) enhance trustworthiness. We tested our solution using a network of devices known as CLOVES, demonstrating robust performance characteristics with UWB technology. Additionally, we evaluated our approach through an indoor localization use case. |
|**2024-06-23**|**SmartAxe: Detecting Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities in Bridge Smart Contracts via Fine-Grained Static Analysis**|Zeqin Liao et.al.|[2406.15999](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15999)| With the increasing popularity of blockchain, different blockchain platforms coexist in the ecosystem (e.g., Ethereum, BNB, EOSIO, etc.), which prompts the high demand for cross-chain communication. Cross-chain bridge is a specific type of decentralized application for asset exchange across different blockchain platforms. Securing the smart contracts of cross-chain bridges is in urgent need, as there are a number of recent security incidents with heavy financial losses caused by vulnerabilities in bridge smart contracts, as we call them Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities (CCVs). However, automatically identifying CCVs in smart contracts poses several unique challenges. Particularly, it is non-trivial to (1) identify application-specific access control constraints needed for cross-bridge asset exchange, and (2) identify inconsistent cross-chain semantics between the two sides of the bridge.   In this paper, we propose SmartAxe, a new framework to identify vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridge smart contracts. Particularly, to locate vulnerable functions that have access control incompleteness, SmartAxe models the heterogeneous implementations of access control and finds necessary security checks in smart contracts through probabilistic pattern inference. Besides, SmartAxe constructs cross-chain control-flow graph (xCFG) and data-flow graph (xDFG), which help to find semantic inconsistency during cross-chain data communication. To evaluate SmartAxe, we collect and label a dataset of 88 CCVs from real-attacks cross-chain bridge contracts. Evaluation results show that SmartAxe achieves a precision of 84.95% and a recall of 89.77%. In addition, SmartAxe successfully identifies 232 new/unknown CCVs from 129 real-world cross-chain bridge applications (i.e., from 1,703 smart contracts). These identified CCVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 1,885,250 USD. |
|**2024-06-23**|**SmartState: Detecting State-Reverting Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts via Fine-Grained State-Dependency Analysis**|Zeqin Liao et.al.|[2406.15988](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15988)| Smart contracts written in Solidity are widely used in different blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, TRON and BNB Chain. One of the unique designs in Solidity smart contracts is its state-reverting mechanism for error handling and access control. Unfortunately, a number of recent security incidents showed that adversaries also utilize this mechanism to manipulate critical states of smart contracts, and hence, bring security consequences such as illegal profit-gain and Deny-of-Service (DoS). In this paper, we call such vulnerabilities as the State-reverting Vulnerability (SRV). Automatically identifying SRVs poses unique challenges, as it requires an in-depth analysis and understanding of the state-dependency relations in smart contracts.   This paper presents SmartState, a new framework for detecting state-reverting vulnerability in Solidity smart contracts via fine-grained state-dependency analysis. SmartState integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness. Particularly, Smart-State extracts state dependencies from both contract bytecode and historical transactions. Both of them are critical for inferring dependencies related to SRVs. Further, SmartState models the generic patterns of SRVs (i.e., profit-gain and DoS) as SRV indicators, and hence effectively identify SRVs based on the constructed state-dependency graph. To evaluate SmartState, we manually annotated a ground-truth dataset which contains 91 SRVs in the real world. Evaluation results showed that SmartState achieves a precision of 87.23% and a recall of 89.13%. In addition, SmartState successfully identifies 406 new SRVs from 47,351 real-world smart contracts. 11 of these SRVs are from popular smart contracts with high transaction amounts (i.e., top 2000). In total, our reported SRVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 428,600 USD. |
|**2024-06-17**|**Blockchain for Academic Integrity: Developing the Blockchain Academic Credential Interoperability Protocol (BACIP)**|Juan A. Berrios Moya et.al.|[2406.15482](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15482)| This research introduces the Blockchain Academic Credential Interoperability Protocol (BACIP), designed to significantly enhance the security, privacy, and interoperability of verifying academic credentials globally, addressing the widespread issue of academic fraud. BACIP integrates dual blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and zero-knowledge proofs to offer a scalable and transparent framework aimed at reducing fraud and improving the mobility and opportunities for students and professionals worldwide. The research methodology adopts a mixed-methods approach, involving a rigorous review of pertinent literature and systematic integration of advanced technological components. This includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses that underpin the development of a universally compatible system. Preliminary evaluations suggest that BACIP could enhance verification efficiency and bolster security against tampering and unauthorized access. While the theoretical framework and practical implementations have laid a solid foundation, the protocol's real-world efficacy awaits empirical validation in a production environment. Future research will focus on deploying a prototype, establishing robust validation policies, and defining precise testing parameters. This critical phase is indispensable for a thorough assessment of BACIP's operational robustness and its compliance with international educational standards. This work contributes significantly to the academic field by proposing a robust model for managing and safeguarding academic credentials, thus laying a strong foundation for further innovation in credential verification using blockchain technology. |

|**2024-06-21**|**AIGC-Chain: A Blockchain-Enabled Full Lifecycle Recording System for AIGC Product Copyright Management**|Jiajia Jiang et.al.|[2406.14966](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14966)| As artificial intelligence technology becomes increasingly prevalent, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is being adopted across various sectors. Although AIGC is playing an increasingly significant role in business and culture, questions surrounding its copyright have sparked widespread debate. The current legal framework for copyright and intellectual property is grounded in the concept of human authorship, but in the creation of AIGC, human creators primarily provide conceptual ideas, with AI independently responsible for the expressive elements. This disconnect creates complexity and difficulty in determining copyright ownership under existing laws. Consequently, it is imperative to reassess the intellectual contributions of all parties involved in the creation of AIGC to ensure a fair allocation of copyright ownership. To address this challenge, we introduce AIGC-Chain, a blockchain-enabled full lifecycle recording system designed to manage the copyright of AIGC products. It is engineered to meticulously document the entire lifecycle of AIGC products, providing a transparent and dependable platform for copyright management. Furthermore, we propose a copyright tracing method based on an Indistinguishable Bloom Filter, named IBFT, which enhances the efficiency of blockchain transaction queries and significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent copyright claims for AIGC products. In this way, auditors can analyze the copyright of AIGC products by reviewing all relevant information retrieved from the blockchain. |
|**2024-06-20**|**SeCTIS: A Framework to Secure CTI Sharing**|Dincy R. Arikkat et.al.|[2406.14102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14102)| The rise of IT-dependent operations in modern organizations has heightened their vulnerability to cyberattacks. As a growing number of organizations include smart, interconnected devices in their systems to automate their processes, the attack surface becomes much bigger, and the complexity and frequency of attacks pose a significant threat. Consequently, organizations have been compelled to seek innovative approaches to mitigate the menaces inherent in their infrastructure. In response, considerable research efforts have been directed towards creating effective solutions for sharing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Current information-sharing methods lack privacy safeguards, leaving organizations vulnerable to leaks of both proprietary and confidential data. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel framework called SeCTIS (Secure Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing), integrating Swarm Learning and Blockchain technologies to enable businesses to collaborate, preserving the privacy of their CTI data. Moreover, our approach provides a way to assess the data and model quality, and the trustworthiness of all the participants leveraging some validators through Zero Knowledge Proofs. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates our framework's correctness and performance, and the detailed attack model discusses its robustness against attacks in the context of data and model quality. |

While Bitcoin has become incredibly famous, its transaction rate has not match such a corresponding increase. It still takes approximately 10 minutes to mine a block and add it to the chain. This limitation highlights the importance of seeking scale-up solutions that solve the low throughput transaction rates. Blockchain's consensus mechanisms make peer-to-peer transactions becomes feasible and effectively eliminate the need for centralized control. However, the decentralized systems also causes a lower speed and throughput compared to centralized networks as we mentioned Bitcoin's block creation rates. Two mainstreams scale-up solutions, Layer 1 scale-up and Layer 2 scale-up have been implemented to address these issues. Layer 1 level scalability enhancements happen at where traditional blockchain operates. This paper provides a deep examination of the components of the Layer 1 protocol and the scale-up methods that directly improve the lower level blockchain. We also address that Layer 1 solutions encounter inherent limitations although improvements were applied due to layer 1 storage costs and latency are high. In addition, we discuss layer 2 protocols, advanced scalability techniques, that elevate blockchain performance by handling transactions off the mainnet. Our findings indicate that Layer 2 protocols, with their various implementations such as rollups and channels, significantly outperform Layer 1 solutions in terms of transaction throughput and efficiency. This paper discusses these Layer 2 scaling methods in detail, aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of these protocols and the underlying logic that drives their effectiveness. |

Compared to Ethereum, however, we observe a lack of research on how Solana smart contract developers handle security, what challenges they encounter, and how this affects the overall security of the ecosystem. To address this, we conducted the first comprehensive study on the Solana platform consisting of a 90-minute Solana smart contract code review task with 35 participants followed by interviews with a subset of seven participants. Our study shows, quite alarmingly, that none of the participants could detect all important security vulnerabilities in a code review task and that 83% of the participants are likely to release vulnerable smart contracts. Our study also sheds light on the root causes of developers' challenges with Solana smart contract development, suggesting the need for better security guidance and resources. In spite of these challenges, our automated analysis on currently deployed Solana smart contracts surprisingly suggests that the prevalence of vulnerabilities - especially those pointed out as the most challenging in our developer study - is below 0.3%. We explore the causes of this counter-intuitive resilience and show that frameworks, such as Anchor, are aiding Solana developers in deploying secure contracts. |

In traditional finance, there are possibilities to create values, e.g., arbitrage offers to create value from market inefficiencies or front-running offers to extract value for the participants having privileged roles. Such opportunities are readily available -- searching programmatically in DeFi. It is commonly known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in the literature. In this survey, first, we show how lucrative such opportunities can be. Next, we discuss how protocol-following participants trying to capture such opportunities threaten to sabotage blockchain's performance and the core tenets of decentralization, transparency, and trustlessness that blockchains are based on. Then, we explain different attempts by the community in the past to address these issues and the problems introduced by these solutions. Finally, we review the current state of research trying to restore trustlessness and decentralization to provide all DeFi participants with a fair marketplace. |

Despite the emergence of numerous blockchain systems, they all suffer from various limitations, which can all be attributed to the fundamental issue posed by the DCS trilemma. In light of this, this work introduces a novel private blockchain system named DCS Chain. The core idea is to quantify the DCS metrics and dynamically adjust the blockchain's performance across these three dimensions, to achieve theoretically optimal system performance. Overall, our system provides a comprehensive suite of blockchain essentials, including DCS quantification, consensus protocol adjustment, and communication network simulation. |

The specification of coefficients is referred to as an {\em instantiation} of the topology. In this paper, we propose a new block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$ parameterized by integers $\rho \geq 2$, $\omega \geq 1$, $\lambda \geq 2$, and $\mu$ a multiple of $\lambda$. In this topology, the code has $\mu$ local codes with $\rho$ parity-check (p-c) constraints and a total of $\mu\rho$ p-c equations fully define the code. Next, we construct a class of block circulant (BC) codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ with blocklength $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, dimension $k=\mu\omega$ that instantiate $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. Every local code of ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ is a $[\rho+\lambda\omega,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized Reed-Solomon (RS) code. The overlap between supports of local codes helps to enhance the minimum distance $\rho+1$ to $2\rho+1$, without compromising much on the rate. We provide an efficient, parallelizable decoding algorithm to correct $2\rho$ erasures when $\lambda=2$ . Finally, we illustrate that the BC codes serve as a viable alternative to 2D RS codes in protocols designed to tackle blockchain networks' data availability (DA) problem. In these protocols, every node in a network of light nodes randomly queries symbols from a codeword stored in full nodes and verifies them using a cryptographic commitment scheme. For the same performance in tackling the DA problem, the BC code requires querying a smaller number of symbols than a comparable 2D RS code for a fixed high rate. Furthermore, the number of local codes in the BC code is typically smaller, yielding a reduction in the complexity of realizing the commitment scheme. |

However, collaboration among different agencies, each with its own blockchains, creates challenges due to diverse protocols and a lack of interoperability, hindering seamless information sharing. Cross-chain technology has been introduced to address these challenges. Current research about blockchains in digital forensics, tends to focus on individual agencies, lacking a comprehensive approach to collaboration and the essential aspect of cross-chain functionality. This emphasizes the necessity for a framework capable of effectively addressing challenges in securely sharing case information, implementing access controls, and capturing provenance data across interconnected blockchains. Our solution, ForensiCross, is the first cross-chain solution specifically designed for digital forensics and provenance. It includes BridgeChain and features a unique communication protocol for cross-chain and multi-chain solutions. ForensiCross offers meticulous provenance capture and extraction methods, mathematical analysis to ensure reliability, scalability considerations for a distributed intermediary in collaborative blockchain contexts, and robust security measures against potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Analysis and evaluation results indicate that ForensiCross is secure and, despite a slight increase in communication time, outperforms in node count efficiency and has secure provenance extraction. As an all-encompassing solution, ForensiCross aims to simplify collaborative investigations by ensuring data integrity and traceability. |

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based copyright traceability framework called ring oscillator-singular value decomposition (RO-SVD), which introduces decomposition computing to approximate low-rank matrices generated from hardware entropy sources and establishes an AI-generated content (AIGC) copyright traceability mechanism at the device level. By leveraging the parallelism and reconfigurability of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), our framework can be easily constructed on existing AI-accelerated devices and provide a low-cost solution to emerging copyright issues of AIGC. We developed a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design prototype based on comprehensive analysis and on-board experiments with multiple AI-applicable FPGAs. Using AI-generated images as a case study, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and emphasised customisation, unpredictability, efficiency, management and reconfigurability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical hardware study discussing and implementing copyright traceability specifically for AI-generated content. |

The dApp supports OID4VC and SD-JWT-compliant wallets for privacy-preserving credential management. Primarily demonstrated through resume verification, the framework is versatile across various domains. By integrating Decentralized Identifiers and advanced cryptographic methods, the dApp addresses inefficiency, high costs, and fraud vulnerabilities, providing a robust solution for modern credential management. |

The transition from centralized to decentralized systems presents challenges such as trust distribution and privacy-preserving credential management. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems is motivated by addressing the single points of failure inherent in centralized systems and leveraging decentralized technologies' transparency and resilience. This paper explores the evolution of certificate status management from centralized to decentralized frameworks, focusing on blockchain technology and advanced cryptography. We provide a taxonomy of the challenges of centralized systems and discuss opportunities provided by existing decentralized technologies. Our findings reveal that, although blockchain technologies enhance security and trust distribution, they represent a bottleneck for parallel computation and face inefficiencies in cryptographic computations. For this reason, we propose a framework of decentralized technology components that addresses such shortcomings to advance the paradigm shift toward decentralized credential status management. |

These issues stem from data silos and communication barriers. This research introduces DIDChain, a framework leveraging blockchain technology, Decentralized Identifiers, and the InterPlanetary File System. DIDChain improves supply chain data management. To address privacy concerns, DIDChain employs a hybrid blockchain architecture that combines public blockchain transparency with the control of private systems. Our hybrid approach preserves the authenticity and reliability of supply chain events. It also respects the data privacy requirements of the participants in the supply chain. Central to DIDChain is the cheqd infrastructure. The cheqd infrastructure enables digital tracing of asset events, such as an asset moving from the milk-producing dairy farm to the cheese manufacturer. In this research, assets are raw materials and products. The cheqd infrastructure ensures the traceability and reliability of assets in the management of supply chain data. Our contribution to blockchain-enabled supply chain systems demonstrates the robustness of DIDChain. Integrating blockchain technology through DIDChain offers a solution to data silos and communication barriers. With DIDChain, we propose a framework to transform the supply chain infrastructure across industries. |

While offering numerous advantages, these components expose various attack surfaces, leading to severe threats to blockchains. In this study, we unveil a novel attack surface, i.e., the state storage, in blockchains. The state storage, based on the Merkle Patricia Trie, plays a crucial role in maintaining blockchain state. Besides, we design Nurgle, the first Denial-of-Service attack targeting the state storage. By proliferating intermediate nodes within the state storage, Nurgle forces blockchains to expend additional resources on state maintenance and verification, impairing their performance. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of Nurgle, including the factors affecting it, its impact on blockchains, its financial cost, and practically demonstrating the resulting damage to blockchains. The implications of Nurgle extend beyond the performance degradation of blockchains, potentially reducing trust in them and the value of their cryptocurrencies. Additionally, we further discuss three feasible mitigations against Nurgle. At the time of writing, the vulnerability exploited by Nurgle has been confirmed by six mainstream blockchains, and we received thousands of USD bounty from them. |

We introduce a model for elections with a binary outcome space where there is a ground truth (i.e., a "correct" outcome), and where stakeholders can only choose to delegate their voting power to a set of delegation representatives (DReps). Moreover, the effort (cost) invested by each DRep positively influences both (i) her ability to vote correctly and (ii) the total delegation that she attracts, thereby increasing her voting power. This model constitutes the natural counterpart of delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, where delegated stakes are used to elect the block builders.   As a way to motivate the representatives to exert effort, a reward scheme can be used based on the delegation attracted by each DRep. We analyze both the game-theoretic aspects and the optimization counterpart of this model. Our primary focus is on selecting a committee that maximizes the probability of reaching the correct outcome, given a fixed monetary budget allocated for rewarding the delegates. Our findings provide insights into the design of effective reward mechanisms and optimal committee structures (i.e., how many DReps are enough) in these PoS-like governance systems. |

This requirement becomes particularly burdensome when the contract state contains dynamic data structures, such as maps, which are needed in many use cases for tracking users interactions with the contract. The problem is twofold: on the one hand, a large state in transactions implies a large transaction fee; on the other hand, a large centralized state is detrimental to the parallelization of transactions, which should be one of the main selling points of UTXO-based blockchains compared to account-based ones. We propose a technique to efficiently execute smart contracts on an extended UTXO blockchain, which allows the contract state to be distributed across multiple UTXOs. In this way, transactions only need to specify the part of the state they need to access, reducing their size (and fees). We also show how to exploit our model to parallelize the validation of transactions on multi-core CPUs. We implement our technique and provide an empirical validation of its effectiveness. |

First, we consider how effort in terms of resources required to process and store a transaction turns into a gas limit, which, through a fee, comprised of the base and priority fee in the current version of Ethereum, is converted into the cost paid by the user. We hew closely to the Ethereum protocol to simplify the analysis and to constrain the design choices when considering multidimensional gas. Second, we assume that the gas price is given deus ex machina by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and evaluate various derivatives. These contracts can, for example, mitigate gas cost volatility. The ability to price and trade forwards besides the existing spot inclusion into the blockchain could be beneficial. |

A Study of Hyperledger Fabric**|Jeeta Ann Chacko et.al.|[2406.06318](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06318)| Similar to other transaction processing frameworks, blockchain systems need to be dynamically reconfigured to adapt to varying workloads and changes in network conditions. However, achieving optimal reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the blockchain stack, which has diverse configurable parameters. This paper explores the concept of self-driving blockchains, which have the potential to predict workload changes and reconfigure themselves for optimal performance without human intervention. We compare and contrast our discussions with existing research on databases and highlight aspects unique to blockchains. We identify specific parameters and components in Hyperledger Fabric, a popular permissioned blockchain system, that are suitable for autonomous adaptation and offer potential solutions for the challenges involved. Further, we implement three demonstrative locally autonomous systems, each targeting a different layer of the blockchain stack, and conduct experiments to understand the feasibility of our findings. Our experiments indicate up to 11% improvement in success throughput and a 30% decrease in latency, making this a significant step towards implementing a fully autonomous blockchain system in the future. |

The robustness of established blockchains presents an opportunity to leverage their infrastructure for creating expansion chains. Expansion chains can provide additional functionality to the primary chain they leverage or implement separate functionalities, while benefiting from the primary chain's security and the stability of its tokens. Indeed, tools like Ethereum's EigenLayer enable nodes to stake (deposit collateral) on a primary chain to form a committee responsible for operating an expansion chain.   But here is the rub. Classical protocols assume correct, well-behaved nodes stay correct indefinitely. Yet in our case, the stake incentivizes correctness--it will be slashed (revoked) if its owner deviates. Once a node withdraws its stake, there is no basis to assume its correctness.   To address the new challenge, we present Aegis, an expansion chain based on primary-chain stake, assuming a bounded primary-chain write time. Aegis uses references from Aegis blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets on the primary chain to establish a new committee if the previous one becomes obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low. |

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on proxy-based upgradable smart contracts to understand the characteristics of contract upgrading. Through our study on 57,118 open source proxy contracts, we found that 583 contracts have ever been upgraded on Ethereum, involving 973 unique implementation contract versions. The results show that developers often intend to improve usability of contracts if upgrading, where functionality addition and update are the most frequent upgrade intentions. We investigated the practical impacts of contract upgrades, e.g., breaking changes causing compatibility issues, storage collisions and initialization risks leading to security vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that there are 4,334 ABI breaking changes due to the upgrades of 276 proxies, causing real-world broken usages within 584 transactions witnessed by the blockchain; 36 contract upgrades had storage collisions and five proxies with 59 implementation contracts are vulnerable to initialization attacks. |
|**2024-06-08**|**SAMM: Sharded Automated Market Makers**|Hongyin Chen et.al.|[2406.05568](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05568)| \emph{Automated Market Makers} (\emph{AMMs}) are a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain-based platforms.   They are smart contracts, enabling the direct exchange of virtual tokens by maintaining \emph{liquidity pools}.   Traders exchange tokens with the contract, paying a fee; liquidity comes from \emph{liquidity providers}, paid by those fees.   But despite growing demand, the performance of AMMs is limited.   State-of-the-art blockchain platforms allow for parallel execution of transactions.   However, we show that AMMs do not enjoy these gains, since their operations are not commutative so transactions using them must be serialized.   We present \emph{SAMM}, an AMM comprising multiple independent \emph{shards}.   All shards are smart contracts operating in the same chain, but they allow for parallel execution as each is independent.   The challenge is that trading in a standard AMM is cheaper if its liquidity pool is larger.   Therefore, we show that simply using multiple smaller AMMs results in traders splitting each trade among all AMMs, which worsens performance.   SAMM addresses this issue with a novel design of the trading fees.   Traders are incentivized to use only a single smallest shard.   We show that all Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE) fit the desired behavior: Liquidity providers balance the liquidity among all pools, so the system converges to the state where trades are evenly distributed.   Evaluation in the Sui blockchain shows that SAMM's throughput is over fivefold that of traditional AMMs, approaching the system's limit.   SAMM is a directly deployable open-source smart contract, allowing trading at scale for individuals and DeFi applications. |

Rajagopal et.al.|[2406.05517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05517)| Modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications generate enormous amounts of data, making data-driven machine learning essential for developing precise and reliable statistical models. However, data is often stored in silos, and strict user-privacy legislation complicates data utilization, limiting machine learning's potential in traditional centralized paradigms due to diverse data probability distributions and lack of personalization. Federated learning, a new distributed paradigm, supports collaborative learning while preserving privacy, making it ideal for IoT applications. By employing cryptographic techniques, IoT systems can securely store and transmit data, ensuring consistency. The integration of federated learning and blockchain is particularly advantageous for handling sensitive data, such as in healthcare. Despite the potential of these technologies, a comprehensive examination of their integration in edge-fog-cloud-based IoT computing systems and healthcare applications is needed. This survey article explores the architecture, structure, functions, and characteristics of federated learning and blockchain, their applications in various computing paradigms, and evaluates their implementations in healthcare. |

Ahsan Habib et.al.|[2406.05151](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05151)| University education play a critical role in shaping intellectual and professional development of the individuals and contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge and society. Generally, university authority has a direct control of students result making and stores the credential in their local dedicated server. So, there is chance to alter the credential and also have a very high possibility to encounter various threats and different security attacks. To resolve these, we propose a blockchain based secure credential management system (BCMS) for efficiently storing, managing and recovering credential without involving the university authority. The proposed BCMS incorporates a modified two factor encryption (m2FE) technique, a combination of RSA cryptosystem and a DNA encoding to ensure credential privacy and an enhanced authentication scheme for teachers and students. Besides, to reduce size of the cipher credential and its conversion time, we use character to integer (C2I) table instead of ASCII table. Finally, the experimental result and analysis of the BCMS illustrate the effectiveness over state of the art works. |
|**2024-06-10**|**Optimizing Exit Queues for Proof-of-Stake Blockchains: A Mechanism Design Approach**|Michael Neuder et.al.|[2406.05124](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05124)| Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols have provable safety and liveness properties for static validator sets. In practice, however, the validator set changes over time, potentially eroding the protocol's security guarantees. For example, systems with accountable safety may lose some of that accountability over time as adversarial validators exit. As a result, protocols must rate limit entry and exit so that the set changes slowly enough to ensure security. Here, the system designer faces a fundamental trade-off. Slower exits increase friction, making it less attractive to stake in the first place. Faster exits provide more utility to stakers but weaken the protocol's security.   This paper provides the first systematic study of exit queues for Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Given a collection of validator-set consistency constraints imposed by the protocol, the social planner's goal is to provide a constrained-optimal mechanism that minimizes disutility for the participants. We introduce the MINSLACK mechanism, a dynamic capacity first-come-first-served queue in which the amount of stake that can exit in a period depends on the number of previous exits and the consistency constraints. We show that MINSLACK is optimal when stakers equally value the processing of their withdrawal. When stakers values are heterogeneous, the optimal mechanism resembles a priority queue with dynamic capacity. However, this mechanism must reserve exit capacity for the future in case a staker with a much higher need for liquidity arrives. We conclude with a survey of known consistency constraints and highlight the diversity of existing exit mechanisms. |

However, legal and policy constraints within specific energy sectors render the data sensitive, presenting technical hurdles in utilizing data from diverse sources. Therefore, we propose adopting a Swarm Learning (SL) scheme, which replaces the centralized server with a blockchain-based distributed network to address the security and privacy issues inherent in Federated Learning (FL)'s centralized architecture. Within this distributed Collaborative Learning framework, each participating organization governs nodes for inter-organizational communication. Devices from various organizations utilize smart contracts for parameter uploading and retrieval. Consensus mechanism ensures distributed consistency throughout the learning process, guarantees the transparent trustworthiness and immutability of parameters on-chain. The efficacy of the proposed framework is substantiated across three real-world energy series modeling scenarios with superior performance compared to Local Learning approaches, simultaneously emphasizing enhanced data security and privacy over Centralized Learning and FL method. Notably, as the number of data volume and the count of local epochs increases within a threshold, there is an improvement in model performance accompanied by a reduction in the variance of performance errors. Consequently, this leads to an increased stability and reliability in the outcomes produced by the model. |

This latter aspect has been significantly enhanced with the advent of cryptocurrencies, which, by fostering decentralisation and anonymity, have transformed this threat into a large-scale outbreak. However, recent reports indicate that a small group of individuals dominate the ransomware ecosystem and try to obfuscate their activity using multiple strains characterised by a short time to live. This scenario suggests that different strains could share mechanisms in ransom collection, fund movement, and money laundering operations. For this reason, this study aims to analyse the address-transaction graphs generated in the Bitcoin network by low-labelled ransomware families. Our goals are to identify payment spreading patterns for evaluating the evolution of ransomware families and to detect similarities among different strains that potentially can be controlled by the same attacker. Specifically, this latter task assigns an address behaviour to each node in the address-transaction graphs according to its dynamics. The distribution of the behaviours in each strain is finally used to evaluate the closeness among different ransomware families. Our findings show that although ransomware families can quickly establish connections with millions of addresses, numerous families require multiple-step analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the introduced behaviours can effectively be used to highlight similarities among different ransomware strains. The outcome shows that families are similar primarily due to behaviours usually associated with ransom collection and money laundering operations.+ |

Given the sensitivity of IoT data, transparent data processing in data sharing and model updates is paramount. However, existing methods fall short in tracing the flow of shared data and the evolution of model updates. Consequently, data sharing is vulnerable to exploitation by malicious entities, raising significant data privacy concerns, while excluding data sharing will result in sub-optimal recommendations. To mitigate these concerns, we present LIBERATE, a privacy-traceable federated recommender system. We design a blockchain-based traceability mechanism, ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model updates. We further enhance privacy protection by incorporating local differential privacy in user-server communication. Extensive evaluations with the real-world dataset corroborate LIBERATE's capabilities in ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model update while maintaining efficiency and performance. Results underscore blockchain-based traceability mechanism as a promising solution for privacy-preserving in federated recommender systems. |

This is because training a LLM needs a large demanding of new data. Federated learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model to contribute their private data to LLM global model. However, integrating federated learning with LLMs introduces new challenges, including the lack of transparency and the need for effective unlearning mechanisms. Transparency is essential to ensuring trust and fairness among participants, while accountability is crucial for deterring malicious behaviour and enabling corrective actions when necessary. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based federated learning framework for LLMs that enhances transparency, accountability, and unlearning capabilities. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of each model's contributions and introduces an innovative unlearning function that seamlessly integrates with the federated learning mechanism. We investigate the impact of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) hyperparameters on unlearning performance and integrate Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the security, transparency, and verifiability of the unlearning process. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework in achieving highly effective unlearning in LLMs trained using federated learning. Our findings highlight the feasibility of integrating blockchain technology into federated learning frameworks for LLMs. |

The centrality of this framework represents a point of failure which is addressed in literature by blockchain-based federated learning approaches. While ensuring a fully-decentralized solution with traceability, such approaches still face several challenges about integrity, confidentiality and scalability to be practically deployed. In this paper, we propose Fantastyc, a solution designed to address these challenges that have been never met together in the state of the art. |

Layer 2 optimistic rollups (L2) are a faster alternative that offer the same interface in terms of smart contract development and user interaction. Optimistic rollups perform most computations offchain and make light use of an underlying blockchain (L1) to guarantee correct behavior, implementing a cheaper blockchain on a blockchain solution. With optimistic rollups, a sequencer calculates offchain batches of L2 transactions and commits batches (compressed or hashed) to the L1 blockchain. The use of hashes requires a data service to translate hashes into their corresponding batches. Current L2 implementations consist of a centralized sequencer (central authority) and an optional data availability committee (DAC).   In this paper, we propose a decentralized L2 optimistic rollup based on Setchain, a decentralized Byzantine-tolerant implementation of sets. The main contribution is a fully decentralized "arranger" where arrangers are a formal definition combining sequencers and DACs. We prove our implementation correct and show empirical evidence that our solution scales. A final contribution is a system of incentives (payments) for servers that implement the sequencer and data availability committee protocols correctly, and a fraud-proof mechanism to detect violations of the protocol. |

Issues such as data privacy risks, service disruptions, and substantial expansion costs have emerged. To address these challenges, an innovative network architecture called Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) has emerged. DePIN leverages blockchain technology to decentralize the control and management of physical devices, addressing limitations of traditional infrastructure network. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of DePIN, presenting its five-layer architecture, key design principles. Furthermore, it presents a detailed survey of the extant applications, operating mechanisms, and provides an in-depth analysis of market data pertaining to DePIN. Finally, it discusses a wide range of the open challenges faced by DePIN. |
|**2024-06-03**|**It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma**|Zishuo Zhao et.al.|[2406.01794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794)| The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.   In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems. |

Pritchard et.al.|[2406.01146](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01146)| Computational workflow management systems power contemporary data-intensive sciences. The slowly resolving reproducibility crisis presents both a sobering warning and an opportunity to iterate on what science and data processing entails. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world's largest radio telescope, is among the most extensive scientific projects underway and presents grand scientific collaboration and data-processing challenges. This work presents a scale and system-agnostic computational workflow model and extends five well-known reproducibility tenets into seven defined for our workflow model. Subsequent implementation of these definitions, powered by blockchain primitives, into the Data Activated Flow Graph Engine (DALiuGE), a workflow management system for the SKA, demonstrates the possibility of facilitating automatic formal verification of scientific quality in amortized constant time. We validate our approach with a simple yet representative astronomical processing task; filtering a noisy signal with a lowpass filter with both CPU and GPU methods. Our framework illuminates otherwise obscure scientific discrepancies and similarities between principally identical workflow executions. |

To alleviate these issues, blockchain-aided decentralized FL (BDFL) introduces the decentralized network architecture into the FL training process, which can effectively overcome the defects of centralized architecture. However, deploying BDFL in wireless networks usually encounters challenges such as limited bandwidth, computing power, and energy consumption. Driven by these considerations, a dynamic stochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average training delay by jointly optimizing the resource allocation and client selection under the constraints of limited energy budget and client participation. We solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear programming problem by employing the tool of Lyapunov optimization and thereby propose the dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling BDFL (DRC-BDFL) algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze the learning performance of DRC-BDFL and derive an upper bound for convergence regarding the global loss function. Extensive experiments conducted on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that DRC-BDFL achieves comparable accuracy to baseline algorithms while significantly reducing the training delay by 9.24% and 12.47%, respectively. |
|**2024-06-02**|**Model-based Analysis of Mining Fairness in a Blockchain**|Akira Sakurai et.al.|[2406.00595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00595)| Mining fairness in blockchain refers to the equality between the computational resources invested in mining and the block rewards received. There exists a dilemma where increasing the blockchain's transaction processing capacity damages mining fairness, consequently undermining its decentralization. This dilemma remains unresolved even with methods such as GHOST, indicating that mining fairness is an inherent bottleneck to the system's transaction processing capacity. Despite its significance, there have been insufficient studies quantitatively analyzing mining fairness.   In this paper, we propose a method to calculate mining fairness. Initially, we approximate a complex blockchain network using a simple mathematical model, assuming that no more than two blocks are generated per round. Within this model, we quantitatively determine local mining fairness and derive several measures of global mining fairness based on local mining fairness.   We validated that our calculation method accurately computes mining fairness in networks with a small number of miners. Furthermore, we analyzed various networks from the perspective of mining fairness. |

Our proposed system offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing participants to select shared models and customize the aggregation for local needs, thereby optimizing system performance, including accurate inference results. Notably, the integration of blockchain technology in our work is to promote a trustless environment, ensuring transparency and non-repudiation among participants when abnormalities are detected. To validate the effectiveness, we conducted real-world federated learning deployments on a private Ethereum platform, using two different models, ranging from simple to complex neural networks. The experimental results indicate comparable inference accuracy between centralized and decentralized federated learning settings. Furthermore, our findings indicate that asynchronous aggregation is a feasible option for simple learning models. However, complex learning models require greater training model involvement in the aggregation to achieve high model quality, instead of asynchronous aggregation. With the implementation of asynchronous aggregation and the flexibility to select models, participants anticipate decreased aggregation time in each communication round, while experiencing minimal accuracy trade-off. |

Moallemi et.al.|[2406.00113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00113)| Milionis et al.(2023) studied the rate at which automated market makers leak value to arbitrageurs when block times are discrete and follow a Poisson process, and where the risky asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. We extend their model to analyze another popular mechanism in decentralized finance for onchain trading: Dutch auctions. We compute the expected losses that a seller incurs to arbitrageurs and expected time-to-fill for Dutch auctions as a function of starting price, volatility, decay rate, and average interblock time. We also extend the analysis to gradual Dutch auctions, a variation on Dutch auctions for selling tokens over time at a continuous rate. We use these models to explore the tradeoff between speed of execution and quality of execution, which could help inform practitioners in setting parameters for starting price and decay rate on Dutch auctions, or help platform designers determine performance parameters like block times. |
|**2024-05-27**|**Federated Learning with Blockchain-Enhanced Machine Unlearning: A Trustworthy Approach**|Xuhan Zuo et.al.|[2405.20776](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20776)| With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios. |
|**2024-05-30**|**SoK: Public Blockchain Sharding**|Md Mohaimin Al Barat et.al.|[2405.20521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20521)| Blockchain's decentralization, transparency, and tamper-resistance properties have facilitated the system's use in various application fields. However, the low throughput and high confirmation latency hinder the widespread adoption of Blockchain. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, including first-layer solutions (or on-chain solutions) and second-layer solutions (or off-chain solutions). Among the proposed solutions, the blockchain sharding system is the most scalable one, where the nodes in the network are divided into several groups. The nodes in different shards work in parallel to validate the transactions and add them to the blocks, and in such a way, the throughput increases significantly. However, previous works have not adequately summarized the latest achievements in blockchain sharding, nor have they fully showcased its state-of-the-art. Our study provides a systemization of knowledge of public blockchain sharding, including the core components of sharding systems, challenges, limitations, and mechanisms of the latest sharding protocols. We also compare their performance and discuss current constraints and future research directions. |

BeerReview, a blockchain-enabled peer review platform, offers a robust solution, enabling experts and scholars to participate actively in the review process without concerns about plagiarism or security threats. Following the completion of its alpha testing, BeerReview demonstrates the potential for expanded deployment. This platform offers improved convenience and more robust intellectual property protection within the peer review process with open source initiative. |
|**2024-05-30**|**The Kosmosis Use-Case of Crypto Rug Pull Detection and Prevention**|Philipp Stangl et.al.|[2405.19762](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19762)| Current methods to prevent crypto asset fraud are based on the analysis of transaction graphs within blockchain networks. While effective for identifying transaction patterns indicative of fraud, it does not capture the semantics of transactions and is constrained to blockchain data. Consequently, preventive methods based on transaction graphs are inherently limited. In response to these limitations, we propose the Kosmosis approach, which aims to incrementally construct a knowledge graph as new blockchain and social media data become available. During construction, it aims to extract the semantics of transactions and connect blockchain addresses to their real-world entities by fusing blockchain and social media data in a knowledge graph. This enables novel preventive methods against rug pulls as a form of crypto asset fraud. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the Kosmosis approach, we examine a series of real-world rug pulls from 2021. Through this case, we illustrate how Kosmosis can aid in identifying and preventing such fraudulent activities by leveraging the insights from the constructed knowledge graph. |

However, without reliable third-party oversight, these methods risk security vulnerabilities during watermark extraction. Furthermore, digital media lacks tangible ownership attributes, posing challenges for secure copyright transfer and tracing. This study introduces DataSafe, a copyright protection scheme that combines physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and blockchain technology. PUF devices use their unique fingerprints for blockchain registration. Subsequently, these devices incorporate invisible watermarking techniques to embed digital watermarks into media for copyright protection. The watermark verification process is confined within the devices, preserving confidentiality during extraction, validating identities during copyright exchanges, and facilitating blockchain-based traceability of copyright transfers. The implementation of a prototype system on the LPC55S69-EVK development board is detailed, illustrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed solution. |

However, long has it been criticized for its tremendous and inefficient utilization of computational power and energy. In this work, we design a dual-functional blockchain framework that uses solving optimization problems to reach consensus as an alternative to PoW, channeling wasted resources into useful work. We model and analyze our framework by developing discrete Markov chains, and derive the security conditions to ensure that selfish miners behave honestly. Based on the security conditions, we derive a lower bound for the security overhead and analyze the trade-off between useful work efficiency and PoW safeguard. We further dive deep into the reward function design for the proposed dual-functional blockchain and provide practical design guidelines for reward functions assuming concavity and linearity respectively. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate and illustrate our analytical results. |
|**2024-05-29**|**On Fairness Concerns in the Blockchain Ecosystem**|Johnnatan Messias Peixoto Afonso et.al.|[2405.18876](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18876)| Blockchains revolutionized centralized sectors like banking and finance by promoting decentralization and transparency. In a blockchain, information is transmitted through transactions issued by participants or applications. Miners crucially select, order, and validate pending transactions for block inclusion, prioritizing those with higher incentives or fees. The order in which transactions are included can impact the blockchain final state. Moreover, applications running on top of a blockchain often rely on governance protocols to decentralize the decision-making power to make changes to their core functionality. These changes can affect how participants interact with these applications. Since one token equals one vote, participants holding multiple tokens have a higher voting power to support or reject the proposed changes. The extent to which this voting power is distributed is questionable and if highly concentrated among a few holders can lead to governance attacks. In this thesis, we audit the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to investigate the norms followed by miners in determining the transaction prioritization. We also audit decentralized governance protocols such as Compound to evaluate whether the voting power is fairly distributed among the participants. Our findings have significant implications for future developments of blockchains and decentralized applications. |
|**2024-05-28**|**Remeasuring the Arbitrage and Sandwich Attacks of Maximal Extractable Value in Ethereum**|Tianyang Chi et.al.|[2405.17944](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17944)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) drives the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem. By strategically including, excluding, or reordering transactions within blocks, block producers/validators can extract additional value, which in turn incentivizes them to keep the decentralization of the whole blockchain platform. Before The Merge of Ethereum in Sep. 2022, around \$675M was extracted in terms of MEV. Despite its importance, current measurement works on MEV suffer some limitations. First, current works only focus on transactions of a very limited number of DApps. Second, current methods heavily rely on fixed heuristic rule-based patterns, leading to false negative/positive. Third, the observations and conclusions are outdated to some extent due to the continuously introduced features, like The Merge in Ethereum. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose two robust methods to identify arbitrage transactions and sandwich attacks, respectively. Then, we apply them to the largest-ever dataset to filter out related MEV transactions. Based on the identified results, we have characterized the overall landscape of the Ethereum MEV ecosystem, the impact the private transaction architectures bring, and the adoption of back-running mechanism. Our research will shed light on future MEV-related work. |
|**2024-05-30**|**Proof of Quality: A Costless Paradigm for Trustless Generative AI Model Inference on Blockchains**|Zhenjie Zhang et.al.|[2405.17934](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17934)| Generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated powerful and disruptive capabilities in natural language and image tasks. However, deploying these models in decentralized environments remains challenging. Unlike traditional centralized deployment, systematically guaranteeing the integrity of AI model services in fully decentralized environments, particularly on trustless blockchains, is both crucial and difficult. In this paper, we present a new inference paradigm called \emph{proof of quality} (PoQ) to enable the deployment of arbitrarily large generative models on blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional approaches based on validating inference procedures, such as ZKML or OPML, our PoQ paradigm focuses on the outcome quality of model inference. Using lightweight BERT-based cross-encoders as our underlying quality evaluation model, we design and implement PQML, the first practical protocol for real-world NLP generative model inference on blockchains, tailored for popular open-source models such as Llama 3 and Mixtral. Our analysis demonstrates that our protocol is robust against adversarial but rational participants in ecosystems, where lazy or dishonest behavior results in fewer benefits compared to well-behaving participants. The computational overhead of validating the quality evaluation is minimal, allowing quality validators to complete the quality check within a second, even using only a CPU. Preliminary simulation results show that PoQ consensus is generated in milliseconds, 1,000 times faster than any existing scheme. |

To promote the efficiency and trustworthiness of DT for wireless IIoT networks, we propose a blockchain-enabled DT (B-DT) framework that employs deep neural network (DNN) partitioning technique and reputation-based consensus mechanism, wherein the DTs maintained at the gateway side execute DNN inference tasks using the data collected from their associated IIoT devices. First, we employ DNN partitioning technique to offload the top-layer DNN inference tasks to the access point (AP) side, which alleviates the computation burden at the gateway side and thereby improves the efficiency of DNN inference. Second, we propose a reputation-based consensus mechanism that integrates Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Specifically, the proposed consensus mechanism evaluates the off-chain reputation of each AP according to its computation resource contributions to the DNN inference tasks, and utilizes the off-chain reputation as a stake to adjust the block generation difficulty. Third, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem of communication resource (i.e., partition point) and computation resource allocation (i.e., computation frequency of APs for top-layer DNN inference and block generation) to minimize system latency under the time-varying channel state and long-term constraints of off-chain reputation, and solve the problem using Lyapunov optimization method. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic DNN partitioning and resource allocation (DPRA) algorithm outperforms the baselines in terms of reducing the overall latency while guaranteeing the trustworthiness of the B-DT system. |
|**2024-05-27**|**Serial Monopoly on Blockchains with Quasi-patient Users**|Paolo Penna et.al.|[2405.17334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17334)| This paper introduces and investigates an extension of the price dynamics in serial monopoly blockchain described in Nisan [Nis23], tailored to accommodate quasi-patient users. Our model reflects users' diminishing interest in having their transactions added to the ledger over time, resulting in only a fraction $\delta$ of the current demand persisting in the subsequent round. The framework presented by Lavi et al. [LSZ22], where users are impatient and derive utility only from immediate transaction inclusion in the next block, corresponds to $\delta=0$. Fully patient users who wait forever as in [Nis23], correspond to $\delta=1$ in our model. This work provides new bounds on the price dynamics for the more interesting case $\delta\in(0,1)$, showing somewhat unexpected effects on the dynamics itself. While the dynamics for the fully patient case is essentially "oblivious" of the structure of the daily demand curve, this is no longer true for finite $\delta < 1$. Moreover, the dynamics undergoes a "transition phase" where for some $\delta$ it behaves as in the fully patient setting ($\delta=1$), and for some smaller values $\delta'<\delta$ it stops "oscillating" and stays at the highest ("monopolist") price. We provide quantitative bounds and analytical results that apply to different demand functions showing that the bounds for $\delta=1$ are not tight in general, for $\delta<1$ . These provide guarantees on the minimum ("admission") price such that transaction willing to pay that price are eventually included (and those who do not want are never included). |

This study explores the various complex difficulties which contributed to the early decommissioning of IoT devices and suggests methods to improve their lifespan management. By examining factors such as security vulnerabilities, user awareness gaps, and the influence of fashion-driven technology trends, the paper underscores the need for legislative interventions, consumer education, and industry accountability. Additionally, it explores innovative approaches to improving IoT longevity, including the integration of sustainability considerations into architectural design through requirements engineering methodologies. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to promote transparent and decentralized processes for device provisioning and tracking. This study promotes a sustainable IoT ecosystem by integrating technology innovation, legal change, and social awareness to reduce environmental impact and enhance resilience for the digital future |
|**2024-05-24**|**Collaborative Access Control for IoT -- A Blockchain Approach**|Yongtao Huang et.al.|[2405.15749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15749)| The Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates robust access control mechanisms to secure a vast array of interconnected devices. Most of the existing IoT systems in practice use centralized solutions. We identify the problems in such solutions and adopt the blockchain based decentralized access control approach. Though there are works in the literature that use blockchain for access control, there are some gaps in these works. We develop a blockchain embedded access control (BEAC) framework to bridge the gaps. First, blockchain based solutions for access control require an enabling P2P network while existing P2P overlays do not support some required features. We develop a novel P2P infrastructure to seamlessly support our BEAC framework. Second, most of the works consider blockchain based access control for a single access control model, and we develop a generic blockchain mechanism and show that it can support the embedding of various access control models. Finally, existing works adopt existing blockchain mechanisms which may incur a high communication overhead. We develop a shortcut approach to improve the number of message rounds in the access protocol. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our system, showing that the shortcut mechanism can reduces access time by approximately 43%. |

However, it still faces challenges in the traditional cooperation mode, due to the high storage and computing cost, geo-location barriers, and local confidentiality regulations. The Jupyter environment has recently emerged and evolved as a vital virtual research environment for scientific computing, which researchers can use to scale computational analyses up to larger datasets and high-performance computing resources. Nevertheless, existing approaches lack robust support of a decentralized cooperation mode to unlock the full potential of decentralized collaborative scientific research, e.g., seamlessly secure data sharing. In this work, we change the basic structure and legacy norms of current research environments via the seamless integration of Jupyter with Ethereum blockchain capabilities. As such, it creates a Decentralized Virtual Research Environment (D-VRE) from private computational notebooks to decentralized collaborative research ecosystem. We propose a novel architecture for the D-VRE and prototype some essential D-VRE elements for enabling secure data sharing with decentralized identity, user-centric agreement-making, membership, and research asset management. To validate our method, we conducted an experimental study to test all functionalities of D-VRE smart contracts and their gas consumption. In addition, we deployed the D-VRE prototype on a test net of the Ethereum blockchain for demonstration. The feedback from the studies showcases the current prototype's usability, ease of use, and potential and suggests further improvements. |
|**2024-05-24**|**Transaction Fee Estimation in the Bitcoin System**|Limeng Zhang et.al.|[2405.15293](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15293)| In the Bitcoin system, transaction fees serve as an incentive for blockchain confirmations. In general, a transaction with a higher fee is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with a smaller fee or no fee may be delayed or never processed at all. However, the transaction fee needs to be specified when submitting a transaction and almost cannot be altered thereafter. Hence it is indispensable to help a client set a reasonable fee, as a higher fee incurs over-spending and a lower fee could delay the confirmation. In this work, we focus on estimating the transaction fee for a new transaction to help with its confirmation within a given expected time. We identify two major drawbacks in the existing works. First, the current industry products are built on explicit analytical models, ignoring the complex interactions of different factors which could be better captured by machine learning based methods; Second, all of the existing works utilize limited knowledge for the estimation which hinders the potential of further improving the estimation quality. As a result, we propose a framework FENN, which aims to integrate the knowledge from a wide range of sources, including the transaction itself, unconfirmed transactions in the mempool and the blockchain confirmation environment, into a neural network model in order to estimate a proper transaction fee. Finally, we conduct experiments on real blockchain datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art works evaluated by MAPE and RMSE. Each variation model in our framework can finish training within one block interval, which shows the potential of our framework to process the realtime transaction updates in the Bitcoin blockchain. |

To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the late 2023 transaction boom that is attributed to inscriptions: a novel approach to record data onto a blockchain with no outside server needed. Inscriptions were first introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain to allow for the representation of NFTs or ERC-20-like tokens without smart contracts, but were later spread to other blockchains.   This work examines the applications of inscription transactions in Ethereum and its major EVM-compatible rollups and their impact on blockchain scalability during periods of sudden transaction surges. We found that on certain days, inscription-related transactions comprised over 89% on Arbitrum, over 88% on zkSync Era, and over 53% on Ethereum. Furthermore, 99% of these transactions were related to the minting of meme coins, followed by limited trading activity. Unlike L1 blockchains, during periods of transaction surges, zkSync and Arbitrum experienced lower median gas fees, attributable to the compression of L2 transactions for a single L1 batch. Additionally, zkSync Era, a ZK rollup, demonstrated a stronger reduction in fees than optimistic rollups considered in our study: Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. |

An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding. |

It divides the $n$ participating nodes into $s$ disjoint groups called shards, where each shard processes transactions in parallel. We investigate scheduling algorithms for the blockchain sharding systems, where each transaction resides in a shard of the communication graph and attempts to access accounts at possibly remote shards. We examine batch scheduling problems on the shard graph $G_s$, where given a set of transactions, we aim to find efficient schedules to execute them as fast as possible. First, we present a centralized scheduler where one of the shards has global knowledge of transactions to be processed. For general graphs, where the transaction and its accessing objects are arbitrarily far from each other with a maximum distance $d$, the centralized scheduler provides $O(kd)$ approximation to the optimal schedule, where $k$ is the maximum number of shards each transaction accesses. Consequently, for a Clique graph where shards are at a unit distance from each other, we obtain $O(k)$ approximation to the optimal schedule. We also get $O(k \log s)$ approximation for Hypercube, Butterfly, and $g$-dimensional Grid, where $g=O(\log s)$. Next, we provide a centralized scheduler with a bucketing approach that offers improved bounds for special cases. Finally, we provide a distributed scheduler where shards do not require global transaction information. We achieve this by using a hierarchical clustering of the shards and using the centralized scheduler in each cluster. We show that the distributed scheduler has a competitive ratio of $O(\mathcal{A_\mathcal{CS}} \log ^2 s)$, where $\mathcal{A_\mathcal{CS}}$ is the approximation ratio of the centralized scheduler. To our knowledge, we are the first to give provably fast transaction scheduling algorithms for blockchain sharding systems. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Dynamically Sharded Ledgers on a Distributed Hash Table**|Christoffer Fink et.al.|[2405.14991](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14991)| Distributed ledger technology such as blockchain is considered essential for supporting large numbers of micro-transactions in the Machine Economy, which is envisioned to involve billions of connected heterogeneous and decentralized cyber-physical systems. This stresses the need for performance and scalability of distributed ledger technologies. Sharding divides the blockchain network into multiple committees and is a common approach to improve scalability. However, with current sharding approaches, costly cross-shard verification is needed to prevent double-spending. This paper proposes a novel and more scalable distributed ledger method named ScaleGraph that implements dynamic sharding by using routing and logical proximity concepts from distributed hash tables. ScaleGraph addresses cyber security in terms of integrity, availability, and trust, to support frequent micro-transactions between autonomous devices. Benefits of ScaleGraph include a total storage space complexity of O(t), where t is the global number of transactions (assuming a constant replication degree). This space is sharded over n nodes so that each node needs O(t/n) storage, which provides a high level of concurrency and data localization as compared to other delegated consensus proposals. ScaleGraph allows for a dynamic grouping of validators which are selected based on a distance metric. We analyze the consensus requirements in such a dynamic setting and show that a synchronous consensus protocol allows shards to be smaller than an asynchronous one, and likely yields better performance. Moreover, we provide an experimental analysis of security aspects regarding the required size of the consensus groups with ScaleGraph. Our analysis shows that dynamic sharding based on proximity concepts brings attractive scalability properties in general, especially when the fraction of corrupt nodes is small. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Towards an Optimal Staking Design: Balancing Security, User Growth, and Token Appreciation**|Nicolas Oderbolz et.al.|[2405.14617](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14617)| This paper examines the economic and security implications of Proof-of-Stake (POS) designs, providing a survey of POS design choices and their underlying economic principles in prominent POS-blockchains. The paper argues that POS-blockchains are essentially platforms that connect three groups of agents: users, validators, and investors. To meet the needs of these groups, blockchains must balance trade-offs between security, user adoption, and investment into the protocol. We focus on the security aspect and identify two different strategies: increasing the quality of validators (static security) vs. increasing the quantity of stakes (dynamic security). We argue that quality comes at the cost of quantity, identifying a trade-off between the two strategies when designing POS systems. We test our qualitative findings using panel analysis on collected data. The analysis indicates that enhancing the quality of the validator set through security measures like slashing and minimum staking amounts may decrease dynamic security. Further, the analysis reveals a strategic divergence among blockchains, highlighting the absence of a single, universally optimal staking design solution. The optimal design hinges upon a platform's specific objectives and its developmental stage. This research compels blockchain developers to meticulously assess the trade-offs outlined in this paper when developing their staking designs. |

This paper explores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in bolstering blockchain-enabled IoT systems, potentially marking a significant leap forward in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality across networks. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable ledger, ideal for the secure management of device identities and transactions in IoT networks. When coupled with AI, these systems gain the ability to not only automate and optimize security protocols but also adaptively respond to new and evolving cyber threats. This dual capability enhances the resilience of networks against cyber-attacks, a critical consideration as IoT devices increasingly permeate critical infrastructures. The synergy between AI and blockchain in IoT is profound. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from IoT devices to detect patterns and anomalies that may signify security breaches. Concurrently, blockchain can ensure that data records are tamper-proof, enhancing the reliability of AI-driven security measures. Moreover, this research evaluates the implications of AI-enhanced blockchain systems on privacy protection within IoT networks. IoT devices often collect sensitive personal data, making privacy a paramount concern. AI can facilitate the development of new protocols that ensure data privacy and user anonymity without compromising the functionality of IoT systems. Through comprehensive analysis and case studies, this paper aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how AI-enhanced blockchain technology can revolutionize network security and privacy in IoT environments. |

This paper explores synergies and challenges between these two technologies.

The proposed model introduces a dual NFT architecture: Membership NFTs (\(NFT_{auth}\)) for authentication and access control, and Interaction NFTs (\(NFT_{priv}\)) for enabling private, encrypted interactions among participants. Governance is enforced through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, such as conditional identity disclosure. By prioritizing privacy, security, and deterrence over financial rewards, this model addresses key challenges in existing blockchain incentive structures, paving the way for more sustainable and decentralized governance frameworks. |

It introduces an AI-powered system model for the dynamic deployment of honeypots, utilizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with smart contract functionalities on IoT nodes. This model enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to suspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The paper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the AI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games. The model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that may initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized honeypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack patterns. |

However, these technologies have been applied in various domains for different purposes. Then, these are successfully assisted in developing the desired system, such as-smart cities, homes, manufacturers, education, and industries. Moreover, these technologies need to consider various issues-security, privacy, confidentiality, scalability, and application challenges in diverse fields. In this context, with the increasing demand for these issues solutions, the authors present a comprehensive survey on the AI approaches with BC in the smart IIoT. Firstly, we focus on state-of-the-art overviews regarding AI, BC, and smart IoT applications. Then, we provide the benefits of integrating these technologies and discuss the established methods, tools, and strategies efficiently. Most importantly, we highlight the various issues--security, stability, scalability, and confidentiality and guide the way of addressing strategy and methods. Furthermore, the individual and collaborative benefits of applications have been discussed. Lastly, we are extensively concerned about the open research challenges and potential future guidelines based on BC-based AI approaches in the intelligent IIoT system. |

The proposed framework leverages PUFs for unique device identification and ZKPs for privacy-preserving authentication and transaction processing.

BDM is built on models and frameworks refined by key identification factors, data analysis, and mathematical or computational aspects applicable to complex business scenarios. Gaining actionable intelligence from collected data for BDM requires a carefully considered infrastructure to ensure data transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability. Organisations should consider social, economic and environmental factors (based on the triple bottom line approach) to ensure sustainability when integrating such an infrastructure. These sustainability features directly impact BDM concerning resource optimisation, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance and environmental impacts. To further understand these segments, taxonomies are defined to evaluate blockchain and DT sustainability features based on an in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art research. Detailed comparative evaluations provide insight into the reachability of the sustainable solution in terms of ideologies, access control and performance overheads. Several research questions are put forward to motivate further research that significantly impacts BDM. Finally, a case study based on an exemplary supply chain management system is presented to show the interoperability of blockchain and DT with BDM. |

The framework addresses the challenge of leveraging health data for analytics while protecting patient privacy. To achieve this, the study integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Federated Learning (FL) to protect sensitive health data collected by IoT nodes. The proposed framework utilizes dynamic personalization and adaptive noise distribution strategies to balance privacy and data utility. Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent aggregation and storage of model updates. Experimental results on the SVHN dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves strong privacy guarantees against various attack scenarios while maintaining high accuracy in health analytics tasks. For 15 rounds of federated learning with an epsilon value of 8.0, the model obtains an accuracy of 64.50%. The blockchain integration, utilizing Ethereum, Ganache, Web3.py, and IPFS, exhibits an average transaction latency of around 6 seconds and consistent gas consumption across rounds, validating the practicality and feasibility of the proposed approach. |

Attacks on DeFi have been frequent and have resulted in losses exceeding \$77 billion. However, detection methods for malicious DeFi events are still lacking. In this paper, we propose DeFiTail, the first framework that utilizes deep learning to detect access control and flash loan exploits that may occur on DeFi. Since the DeFi protocol events involve invocations with multi-account transactions, which requires execution path unification with different contracts. Moreover, to mitigate the impact of mistakes in Control Flow Graph (CFG) connections, we validate the data path by employing the symbolic execution stack. Furthermore, we feed the data paths through our model to achieve the inspection of DeFi protocols. Experimental results indicate that DeFiTail achieves the highest accuracy, with 98.39% in access control and 97.43% in flash loan exploits. DeFiTail also demonstrates an enhanced capability to detect malicious contracts, identifying 86.67% accuracy from the CVE dataset. |

Every cryptocurrency must have an associated Blockchain. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies, this may be considered as the most promising disruptive technology in the industry 4.0 context. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based financial infrastructure, the term generally refers to an open, permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. It replicates existing financial services in a more open and transparent way. DeFi does not rely on intermediaries and centralized institutions. Instead, it is based on open protocols and decentralized applications (Dapps). Considering that there are many digital coins, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these currencies should interact among each other sometime. For this interaction the Information Technology elements play an important whole as enablers and IT strategic alignment. This paper considers the strategic alignment model proposed by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) and Luftman (1996). This paper seeks to answer two main questions 1) What are the common IT elements in the DeFi? And 2) How the elements connect to the IT strategic alignment in DeFi? Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Results point out that there are many IT elements already mentioned by literature, however there is a lack in the literature about the connection between IT elements and IT strategic alignment in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) architectural network. After final considerations, limitations and future research agenda are presented. Keywords: IT Strategic alignment, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Cryptocurrency, Digital Economy. |

However, the Internet's combination of low communication cost, global reach, and functional anonymity has allowed scam volumes to reach new heights. Designing effective interventions requires first understanding the context: how scammers reach potential victims, the earnings they make, and any potential bottlenecks for durable interventions. In this short paper, we focus on these questions in the context of cryptocurrency giveaway scams, where victims are tricked into irreversibly transferring funds to scammers under the pretense of even greater returns. Combining data from Twitter, YouTube and Twitch livestreams, landing pages, and cryptocurrency blockchains, we measure how giveaway scams operate at scale. We find that 1 in 1000 scam tweets, and 4 in 100,000 livestream views, net a victim, and that scammers managed to extract nearly \$4.62 million from just hundreds of victims during our measurement window. |

To avoid the limitation of serially adding one block at a time to a blockchain, multiple semi-independent chains are used such that several valid blocks can be added in parallel, when they are added to separate chains. Blocks are added to different chains, the chain index being determined by a ``ticket'' that the miner must produce before creating a new block. This allows increasing the transaction rate by several orders of magnitude while the system is still fully decentralized and permissionless, and maintaining security in the sense that a successful attack would require the attacker to control a significant portion of the whole network. |
|**2024-05-15**|**Flashback: Enhancing Proposer-Builder Design with Future-Block Auctions in Proof-of-Stake Ethereum**|Yifan Mao et.al.|[2405.09465](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09465)| Maximal extractable value (MEV) in which block proposers unethically gain profits by manipulating the order in which transactions are included within a block, is a key challenge facing blockchains such as Ethereum today. Left unchecked, MEV can lead to a centralization of stake distribution thereby ultimately compromising the security of blockchain consensus. To preserve proposer decentralization (and hence security) of the blockchain, Ethereum has advocated for a proposer-builder separation (PBS) in which the functionality of transaction ordering is separated from proposers and assigned to separate entities called builders. Builders accept transaction bundles from searchers, who compete to find the most profitable bundles. Builders then bid completed blocks to proposers, who accept the most profitable blocks for publication. The auction mechanisms used between searchers, builders and proposers are crucial to the overall health of the blockchain. In this paper, we consider PBS design in Ethereum as a game between searchers, builders and proposers. A key novelty in our design is the inclusion of future block proposers, as all proposers of an epoch are decided ahead of time in proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum within the game model. Our analysis shows the existence of alternative auction mechanisms that result in a better (more profitable) equilibrium to players compared to state-of-the-art. Experimental evaluations based on synthetic and real-world data traces corroborate the analysis. Our results highlight that a rethinking of auction mechanism designs is necessary in PoS Ethereum to prevent disruption. |

However, the DEX project with multi-contract interaction is accompanied by complex state logic, which makes it challenging to solve state defects. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on state derailment defects of DEXs. These defects could lead to incorrect, incomplete, or unauthorized changes to the system state during contract execution, potentially causing security threats. We propose StateGuard, a deep learning-based framework to detect state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. StateGuard constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the smart contract, extracting key features to generate a graph representation. Then, it leverages a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to discover defects. Evaluating StateGuard on 46 DEX projects with 5,671 smart contracts reveals its effectiveness, with a precision of 92.24%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuard to audit real-world smart contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs. |

We describe methods to restrict functions from being called twice in the same transaction, block, or time period. This is related to the notion of non-reentrant functions, which are functions that can be called within a previous execution. These methods can be used to restrict interactions with entire sets of functions of smart contracts. We are motivated to revisit this topic for two reasons. First, we note that sixteen real-world smart contracts exploits in 2023 resulting in over $136M USD lost or stolen that could have been prevented by restricting function calls. As part of this survey, we dissect a new class of exploit that involves so-called read-only reentrancy: exploits that re-enter read-only functions to make smart contract state inconsistent in order to enable their exploitation. Second, while some of these approaches are simple, they may not always behave the same across different blockchains that support Solidity. |

We further discuss our motivation, implementation, design decisions, limitations, and preliminary results. Overall, this paper is intended to serve as an initial introduction to building such system(s) on top of the Solana L1 blockchain, but does not represent an absolute. Lastly, we comment discuss on extensions of this specification to support SVM rollups on other well-established L1 blockchains systems such as Ethereum. |

The proposed network is structured into a primary layer, consisting of Road Side Units and edge servers as servers of Blockchain-enabled Domain Name Services for managing inter-vehicle communications identities, and a sub-layer within each vehicle for intra-vehicle communications via the Blockchain-enabled Mutual Authentication Protocol. This design facilitates secure connections across vehicles by coordinating between the layers, significantly improving communications security and efficiency. This study also evaluates Road Side Unit availability against the random distribution of Road Side Units along the route of different vehicles. The proposed model presents a novel pathway towards a decentralised, secure, and efficient Internet of Vehicles ecosystem, contributing to the advancement of autonomous and trustworthy vehicular networks. |

This deployment, called the Industrial Metaverse, is used for product design, production operations, industrial quality inspection, and product testing. However, there lacks of in-depth understanding of the enabling technologies associated with the Industrial Metaverse. This encompasses both the precise industrial scenarios targeted by each technology and the potential migration of technologies developed in other domains to the industrial sector. Driven by this issue, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on the Industrial Metaverse. Specifically, we first analyze the advantages of the Metaverse for industrial production. Then, we review a collection of key enabling technologies of the Industrial Metaverse, including blockchain (BC), digital twin (DT), 6G, XR, and artificial intelligence (AI), and analyze how these technologies can support different aspects of industrial production. Subsequently, we present numerous formidable challenges encountered within the Industrial Metaverse, including confidentiality and security concerns, resource limitations, and interoperability constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the extant solutions devised to address them. Finally, we briefly outline several open issues and future research directions of the Industrial Metaverse. |
|**2024-05-14**|**Cross-Blockchain Communication Using Oracles With an Off-Chain Aggregation Mechanism Based on zk-SNARKs**|Michael Sober et.al.|[2405.08395](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08395)| The closed architecture of prevailing blockchain systems renders the usage of this technology mostly infeasible for a wide range of real-world problems. Most blockchains trap users and applications in their isolated space without the possibility of cooperating or switching to other blockchains. Therefore, blockchains need additional mechanisms for seamless communication and arbitrary data exchange between each other and external systems. Unfortunately, current approaches for cross-blockchain communication are resource-intensive or require additional blockchains or tailored solutions depending on the applied consensus mechanisms of the connected blockchains. Therefore, we propose an oracle with an off-chain aggregation mechanism based on ZeroKnowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to facilitate cross-blockchain communication. The oracle queries data from another blockchain and applies a rollup-like mechanism to move state and computation off-chain. The zkOracle contract only expects the transferred data, an updated state root, and proof of the correct execution of the aggregation mechanism. The proposed solution only requires constant 378 kgas to submit data on the Ethereum blockchain and is primarily independent of the underlying technology of the queried blockchains. |

We argue, that this correctness needs to be foundational: correctness needs to be based on the operational semantics of their execution environment. In this work we present a foundational system - the DeepSEA system - targeting the Ethereum blockchain as the largest smart contract platform. The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding. |

Transactions serve as key sources of evidence and play a vital role in forensic analysis. Timed transaction refers to a specific class of service that enables a user to schedule a transaction to change the blockchain state during a chosen future time-frame. This paper proposes T-Watch, a decentralized and cost-efficient approach for users to schedule timed execution of any type of transaction in Ethereum with privacy guarantees. T-Watch employs a novel combination of threshold secret sharing and decentralized smart contracts. To protect the private elements of a scheduled transaction from getting disclosed before the future time-frame, T-Watch maintains shares of the decryption key of the scheduled transaction using a group of executors recruited in a blockchain network before the specified future time-frame and restores the scheduled transaction at a proxy smart contract to trigger the change of blockchain state at the required time-frame. To reduce the cost of smart contract execution in T-Watch, we carefully design the proposed protocol to run in an optimistic mode by default and then switch to a pessimistic mode once misbehaviors occur. Furthermore, the protocol supports users to form service request pooling to further reduce the gas cost. We rigorously analyze the security of T-Watch and implement the protocol over the Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that T-Watch is more scalable compared to the state of the art and could reduce the cost by over 90% through pooling. |

Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of quorum systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. In particular, we show that any quorum system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "commmittees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under very reasonable conditions, a general proof with significance of its own. Under similarly relaxed conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and process load; this illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. Our multilevel construction allows nodes to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain, noting that this functionality, if applied to a proof-of-stake blockchain, can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based, probabilistic block finalization; or (ii) a service for reorg tolerance. |

However, the efficiency and scalability of proof systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in the context of Merkle tree inclusion proofs. Traditional proof aggregation techniques based on AND logic suffer from high verification complexity and data communication overhead, limiting their practicality for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a novel proof aggregation approach based on OR logic, which enables the generation of compact and universally verifiable proofs for Merkle tree inclusion. By aggregating proofs using OR logic, we achieve a proof size that is independent of the number of leaves in the tree, and verification can be performed using any single valid leaf hash. This represents a significant improvement over AND aggregation, which requires the verifier to process all leaf hashes. We formally define the OR aggregation logic, describe the process of generating universal proofs, and provide a comparative analysis demonstrating the advantages of our approach in terms of proof size, verification data, and universality. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of combining OR and AND aggregation logics to create complex acceptance functions, enabling the development of expressive and efficient proof systems for various blockchain applications. The proposed techniques have the potential to significantly enhance the scalability, efficiency, and flexibility of zero-knowledge proof systems, paving the way for more practical and adaptive solutions in the blockchain ecosystem. |
|**2024-05-13**|**Towards Rational Consensus in Honest Majority**|Varul Srivastava et.al.|[2405.07557](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07557)| Distributed consensus protocols reach agreement among $n$ players in the presence of $f$ adversaries; different protocols support different values of $f$. Existing works study this problem for different adversary types (captured by threat models). There are three primary threat models: (i) Crash fault tolerance (CFT), (ii) Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and (iii) Rational fault tolerance (RFT), each more general than the previous. Agreement in repeated rounds on both (1) the proposed value in each round and (2) the ordering among agreed-upon values across multiple rounds is called Atomic BroadCast (ABC). ABC is more generalized than consensus and is employed in blockchains.   This work studies ABC under the RFT threat model. We consider $t$ byzantine and $k$ rational adversaries among $n$ players. We also study different types of rational players based on their utility towards (1) liveness attack, (2) censorship or (3) disagreement (forking attack). We study the problem of ABC under this general threat model in partially-synchronous networks. We show (1) ABC is impossible for $n/3< (t+k) <n/2$ if rational players prefer liveness or censorship attacks and (2) the consensus protocol proposed by Ranchal-Pedrosa and Gramoli cannot be generalized to solve ABC due to insecure Nash equilibrium (resulting in disagreement). For ABC in partially synchronous network settings, we propose a novel protocol \textsf{pRFT}(practical Rational Fault Tolerance). We show \textsf{pRFT} achieves ABC if (a) rational players prefer only disagreement attacks and (b) $t < \frac{n}{4}$ and $(t + k) < \frac{n}{2}$ . In \textsf{pRFT}, we incorporate accountability (capturing deviating players) within the protocol by leveraging honest players. We also show that the message complexity of \textsf{pRFT} is at par with the best consensus protocols that guarantee accountability. |

A blockchain-based public key infrastructure allows the usage of public key cryptography and public key based authentication protocols. The blockchain provides a common storage of the public keys and their relations and can provide the required information for the authentication process. Furthermore, the unmanned aerial vehicles store selected parts of the blockchain in order to operate independently in areas where they might not have access to the Internet. This allows unmanned aerial vehicles to authenticate entities of the network, like other unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud services, cars, and any computer. |

As synthetic data proliferates, the need for a robust evaluation framework to select a synthetic data generator becomes more pressing given the variety of options available. In this research study, we investigate two primary questions: 1) How can we select the most suitable synthetic data generator from a set of options for a specific purpose? 2) How can we make the selection process more transparent, accountable, and auditable? To address these questions, we introduce a novel approach in which the proposed ranking algorithm is implemented as a smart contract within a permissioned blockchain framework called Sawtooth. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art baseline ranking solutions, our framework demonstrates its effectiveness in providing nuanced rankings that consider both desirable and undesirable properties. Furthermore, our framework serves as a valuable tool for selecting the optimal synthetic data generators for specific needs while ensuring compliance with data protection principles. |

Our algorithm takes a new approach of selecting validator shards for each transaction from those that previously held the assets being transferred. This approach ensures the algorithm's robustness and efficiency. TRAIL is presented using PBFT for internal shard transaction processing and a modified version of PBFT for external cross-shard validation. We describe TRAIL, prove it correct, analyze its message complexity, and evaluate its performance. We propose various TRAIL optimizations: we describe how it can be adapted to other Byzantine-tolerant consensus algorithms, how a complete system may be built on the basis of it, and how TRAIL can be applied to existing and future sharded blockchains. |

The advent of spatial computing and Extended Reality technologies further pushes the boundaries, promising a fusion of physical and digital realms through interactive environments. This paper delves into the progression from All Realities technologies encompassing Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mediated Reality to spatial computing, highlighting their conceptual differences and applications. We explore enabling technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and blockchain that underpin the development of spatial computing. We further scrutinize the initial forays into commercial spatial computing devices, with a focus on Apple's Vision Pro, evaluating its technological advancements alongside the challenges it faces. Through this examination, we aim to provide insights into the potential of spatial computing to revolutionize our interaction with digital information and the physical world. |
|**2024-05-19**|**Implementation Study of Cost-Effective Verification for Pietrzak's Verifiable Delay Function in Ethereum Smart Contracts**|Suhyeon Lee et.al.|[2405.06498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06498)| Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a cryptographic concept that ensures a minimum delay before output through sequential processing, which is resistant to parallel computing. Among the two well-known VDF protocols, Wesolowski and Pietrzak VDF, we focus on the Pietrzak VDF due to its computational efficiency and suitability for blockchain environments. Pietrzak's approach uses a recursive proof verification with the halving protocol, offering a practical alternative despite the longer proof length than Wesolowski's approach. Given the scarcity of research on practical VDF verification implementation, especially within smart contracts, this paper aims to implement cost-effective verification for the Pietrzak VDF in an Ethereum-based environment without compromising the VDF verification's integrity and reliability. Firstly, we propose generalized proof generation and verification algorithms for potential efficiency improvement. Secondly, we categorize and measure the gas cost of each part in a transaction for VDF verification. Thirdly, based on the analysis, we theoretically predict the optimized proof construction. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical prediction matches the implementation results. Furthermore, our research shows that the proof length of the Pietrzak VDF is generated under 8 KB with the 2048-bit RSA key length, much smaller than the previous expectation. This implies that the Pietrzak VDF can be practically used for cryptographic applications on blockchains. |
|**2024-05-09**|**Deferred Objects to Enhance Smart Contract Programming with Optimistic Parallel Execution**|George Mitenkov et.al.|[2405.06117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06117)| One of the main bottlenecks of blockchains is smart contract execution. To increase throughput, modern blockchains try to execute transactions in parallel. Unfortunately, however, common blockchain use cases introduce read-write conflicts between transactions, forcing sequentiality.   We propose RapidLane, an extension for parallel execution engines that allows the engine to capture computations in conflicting parts of transactions and defer their execution until a later time, sometimes optimistically predicting execution results. This technique, coupled with support for a new construct for smart contract languages, allows one to turn certain sequential workloads into parallelizable ones.   We integrated RapidLane into Block-STM, a state-of-the-art parallel execution engine used by several blockchains in production, and deployed it on the Aptos blockchain. Our evaluation shows that on commonly contended workloads, such as peer-to-peer transfers with a single fee payer and NFT minting, RapidLane yields up to $12\times$ more throughput. |

A political look at the blockchain vision**|Rainer Rehak et.al.|[2405.06097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06097)| A lot of business and research effort currently deals with the so called decentralised ledger technology blockchain. Putting it to use carries the tempting promise to make the intermediaries of social interactions superfluous and furthermore keep secure track of all interactions. Currently intermediaries such as banks and notaries are necessary and must be trusted, which creates great dependencies, as the financial crisis of 2008 painfully demonstrated. Especially banks and notaries are said to become dispensable as a result of using the blockchain. But in real-world applications of the blockchain, the power of central actors does not dissolve, it only shifts to new, democratically illegitimate, uncontrolled or even uncontrollable power centers. As interesting as the blockchain technically is, it doesn't efficiently solve any real-world problem and is no substitute for traditional political processes or democratic regulation of power. Research efforts investigating the blockchain should be halted. |
|**2024-05-09**|**Knowledge Connectivity Requirements for Solving BFT Consensus with Unknown Participants and Fault Threshold (Extended Version)**|Hasan Heydari et.al.|[2405.06055](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06055)| Consensus stands as a fundamental building block for constructing reliable and fault-tolerant distributed services. The increasing demand for high-performance and scalable blockchain protocols has brought attention to solving consensus in scenarios where each participant joins the system knowing only a subset of participants. In such scenarios, the participants' initial knowledge about the existence of other participants can collectively be represented by a directed graph known as knowledge connectivity graph. The Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus with Unknown Participants (BFT-CUP) problem aims to solve consensus in those scenarios by identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions that the knowledge connectivity graphs must satisfy when a fault threshold is provided to all participants. This work extends BFT-CUP by eliminating the requirement to provide the fault threshold to the participants. We indeed address the problem of solving BFT consensus in settings where each participant initially knows a subset of participants, and although a fault threshold exists, no participant is provided with this information -- referred to as BFT Consensus with Unknown Participants and Fault Threshold (BFT-CUPFT). With this aim, we first demonstrate that the conditions for knowledge connectivity graphs identified by BFT-CUP are insufficient to solve BFT-CUPFT. Accordingly, we introduce a new type of knowledge connectivity graphs by determining the necessary and sufficient conditions they must satisfy to solve BFT-CUPFT. Furthermore, we design a protocol for solving BFT-CUPFT. |
|**2024-05-08**|**Advancing Blockchain Scalability: A Linear Optimization Framework for Diversified Node Allocation in Shards**|Björn Assmann et.al.|[2405.05245](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05245)| Blockchain technology, while revolutionary in enabling decentralized transactions, faces scalability challenges as the ledger must be replicated across all nodes of the chain, limiting throughput and efficiency. Sharding, which divides the chain into smaller segments, called shards, offers a solution by enabling parallel transaction processing. However, sharding introduces new complexities, notably how to allocate nodes to shards without compromising the network's security.   This paper introduces a novel linear optimization framework for node allocation to shards that addresses decentralization constraints while minimizing resource consumption. In contrast to traditional methods that depend on random or trust-based assignments, our approach evaluates node characteristics, including ownership, hardware, and geographical distribution, and requires an explicit specification of decentralization targets with respect to these characteristics. By employing linear optimization, the framework identifies a resource-efficient node set meeting these targets. Adopted by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) community, this framework proves its utility in real-world blockchain applications. It provides a quantitative tool for node onboarding and offboarding decisions, balancing decentralization and resource considerations. |

This study explores the potential of blockchain in enhancing data integrity and traceability within Industry Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), a crucial aspect in the era of Industry 4.0. ICPS, integrating computational and physical components, is pivotal in managing critical infrastructure like manufacturing, power grids, and transportation networks. However, they face challenges in security, privacy, and reliability. With its inherent immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, blockchain presents a groundbreaking approach to address these challenges. It ensures robust data reliability and traceability across ICPS, enhancing transaction transparency and facilitating secure data sharing. This research unearths various blockchain applications in ICPS, including supply chain management, quality control, contract management, and data sharing. Each application demonstrates blockchain's capacity to streamline processes, reduce fraud, and enhance system efficiency. In supply chain management, blockchain provides real-time auditing and compliance. For quality control, it establishes tamper-proof records, boosting consumer confidence. In contract management, smart contracts automate execution, enhancing efficiency. Blockchain also fosters secure collaboration in ICPS, which is crucial for system stability and safety. This study emphasizes the need for further research on blockchain's practical implementation in ICPS, focusing on challenges like scalability, system integration, and security vulnerabilities. It also suggests examining blockchain's economic and organizational impacts in ICPS to understand its feasibility and long-term advantages. |

Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing. However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns. For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data. This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications. We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs. Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains. Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT. Ultimately, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the synergies between blockchains and the IoT ecosystem, highlighting the opportunities and complexities involved. |

Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results. |

To this end, we propose a novel selfish mining attack that aims to maximize this objective and formally model the attack as a Markov decision process (MDP). We then present a formal analysis procedure which computes an $\epsilon$-tight lower bound on the optimal expected relative revenue in the MDP and a strategy that achieves this $\epsilon$-tight lower bound, where $\epsilon>0$ may be any specified precision. Our analysis is fully automated and provides formal guarantees on the correctness. We evaluate our selfish mining attack and observe that it achieves superior expected relative revenue compared to two considered baselines.   In concurrent work [Sarenche FC'24] does an automated analysis on selfish mining in predictable longest-chain blockchains based on efficient proof systems. Predictable means the randomness for the challenges is fixed for many blocks (as used e.g., in Ouroboros), while we consider unpredictable (Bitcoin-like) chains where the challenge is derived from the previous block. |

However, this expansion accompanies security challenges, making these wallets prime targets for malicious activities. Despite a substantial user base, there is not only a significant gap in comprehensive security analysis but also a pressing need for specialized tools that can aid developers in reducing vulnerabilities during the development process. To fill the void, we present a comprehensive security analysis of browser-based wallets in this paper, along with the development of an automated tool designed for this purpose. We first compile a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities resident in cryptocurrency wallets by harvesting historical security reports. Based on this, we design WALLETRADAR, an automated detection framework that can accurately identify security issues based on static and dynamic analysis. Evaluation of 96 popular browser-based wallets shows WALLETRADAR's effectiveness, by successfully automating the detection process in 90% of these wallets with high precision. This evaluation has led to the discovery of 116 security vulnerabilities corresponding to 70 wallets. By the time of this paper, we have received confirmations of 10 vulnerabilities from 8 wallet developers, with over $2,000 bug bounties. Further, we observed that 12 wallet developers have silently fixed 16 vulnerabilities after our disclosure. WALLETRADAR can effectively automate the identification of security risks in cryptocurrency wallets, thereby enhancing software development quality and safety in the blockchain ecosystem. |

However, DNN model trading may trigger concerns of the unauthorized replications or misuses over the model, so that the benefit of the model ownership will be violated. Model identity auditing is a challenging issue in protecting intellectual property of DNN models and verifying the integrity and ownership of models for guaranteeing trusts in transactions is one of the critical obstacles. In this paper, we focus on the above issue and propose a novel Accumulator-enabled Auditing for Distributed Identity of DNN Model (A2-DIDM) that utilizes blockchain and zero-knowledge techniques to protect data and function privacy while ensuring the lightweight on-chain ownership verification. The proposed model presents a scheme of identity records via configuring model weight checkpoints with corresponding zero-knowledge proofs, which incorporates predicates to capture incremental state changes in model weight checkpoints. Our scheme ensures both computational integrity of DNN training process and programmability, so that the uniqueness of the weight checkpoint sequence in a DNN model is preserved, ensuring the correctness of the model identity auditing. In addition, A2-DIDM also addresses privacy protections in distributed identity via a proposed method of accumulators. We systematically analyze the security and robustness of our proposed model and further evaluate the effectiveness and usability of auditing DNN model identities. |

Current blockchain-based CT approaches require off-chain negotiation of critical information and often overlook the dynamic session keys updating, which increases the risk of message and key leakage. Additionally, in some approaches the covert transactions exhibit obvious characteristics that can be easily detected by third-parties. Moreover, most approaches do not address the issue of decreased reliability of message transmission in blockchain attack scenarios. Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based approaches also have the issue of transaction linkability, which can be tackled by Monero-based approaches because of the privacy protection mechanisms in Monero. However, Monero-based CT has the problem of sender repudiation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monero-Based CT approach (MBCT), which enables on-chain session key dynamically updating without off-chain negotiation. MBCT can assure non-repudiation of transmission participants, confidentiality of keys, reliability of message transmission and less observable characteristics. There are achieved by the three components in MBCT, namely, a sender authentication method, a dynamically on-chain session key updating method and a state feedback method. We implement MBCT in Monero-0.18.1.0 and the experiment results demonstrate its high embedding capacity of MBCT. |

Blockchain is a robust distributed ledger that uses consensus algorithms to approve transactions in a decentralized manner, making malicious tampering extremely difficult. Ethereum, one of the blockchains, can be seen as an unstoppable computer which shared by users around the world that can run Turing-complete programs. In order to run any program on Ethereum, Ether (currency on Ethereum) is required. In other words, Ether can be seen as a kind of energy in the Ethereum world. We developed self-replicating and self-employed agents who earn the energy by themselves to replicate them, on the Ethereum blockchain. The agents can issued their token and gain Ether each time the tokens are sold. When a certain amount of Ether is accumulated, the agent replicates itself and leaves offspring. The goal of this project is to implement artificial agents that lives for itself, not as a tool for humans, in the open cyber space connected to the real world. |

However, there are still many security issues in FL that deserve discussion. In this paper, we consider three major issues: 1) how to ensure that the training process can be publicly audited by any third party; 2) how to avoid the influence of malicious participants on training; 3) how to ensure that private gradients and models are not leaked to third parties. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, while solving the above three problems simultaneously is seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a publicly auditable and privacy-preserving federated learning scheme that is resistant to malicious participants uploading gradients with wrong directions and enables anyone to audit and verify the correctness of the training process. In particular, we design a robust aggregation algorithm capable of detecting gradients with wrong directions from malicious participants. Then, we design a random vector generation algorithm and combine it with zero sharing and blockchain technologies to make the joint training process publicly auditable, meaning anyone can verify the correctness of the training. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments, and the experimental results show that the model generated by the protocol is comparable in accuracy to the original FL approach while keeping security advantages. |

This paper focuses on developing a performance guarantee for the distributed estimation in a BIoT in the presence of malicious attacks which jointly exploits vulnerabilities present in both IoT devices and the employed blockchain within the BIoT. To achieve this, we adopt the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as the performance metric, and maximize the CRB for estimating the parameter of interest over the attack domain. However, the maximization problem is inherently non-convex, making it infeasible to obtain the globally optimal solution in general. To address this issue, we develop a relaxation method capable of transforming the original non-convex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we derive the analytical expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed optimization problem. The optimal value of the relaxed optimization problem can be used to provide a valid estimation performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks. |

A significant challenge in P2P content delivery remains: the fair compensation of relayers for their bandwidth contributions. Existing solutions employ blockchains for payment settlements, however, they are not practical due to high on-chain costs and over-simplified network assumptions. In this paper, we introduce FairRelay, a fair and cost-efficient protocol that ensures all participants get fair payoff in complex content delivery network settings. We introduce a novel primitive, Enforceable Accumulative Hashed TimeLock Contract (Enforceable A-HTLC), designed to guarantee payment atomicity - ensuring all participants receive their payments upon successful content delivery.   The fairness of FairRelay is proved using the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Our evaluation demonstrates that, in optimistic scenarios, FairRelay employs zero on-chain costs. In pessimistic scenarios, the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are constant, irrespective of the network complexity. Specifically, empirical results indicate that the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are 24,902 gas (equivalent to 0.01 USD on Optimism L2) and 290,797 gas (0.07 USD), respectively. In a 10-hop relay path, FairRelay introduces less than 1.5% additional overhead compared to pure data transmission, showcasing the efficiency of FairRelay. |

TetraBFT has several compelling features: it necessitates only constant local storage, has optimal communication complexity, satisfies optimistic responsiveness -- allowing the protocol to operate at actual network speeds under ideal conditions -- and can achieve consensus in just 5 message delays, which outperforms all known unauthenticated protocols achieving the other properties listed. We validate the correctness of TetraBFT through rigorous security analysis and formal verification. Furthermore, we extend TetraBFT into a multi-shot, chained consensus protocol, making a pioneering effort in applying pipelining techniques to unauthenticated protocols. This positions TetraBFT as a practical and deployable solution for blockchain systems aiming for high efficiency. |

BFT-based consensus mechanisms are widely adopted in the permissioned blockchain to meet the high scalability requirements of the network. Sybil attacks are one of the most potential threats when applying BFT-based consensus mechanisms in permissionless blockchain due to the lack of effective verification mechanisms for participants' identities. This paper presents a novel endorsement-based bootstrapping protocol with a signature algorithm that offers a streamlined, scalable identity endorsement and verification process. This approach effectively safeguards the BFT-based consensus mechanism against Sybil attacks. Using our proposed method, we have conducted thorough security analyses and simulation experiments to assess security, robustness, and scalability advantages in large-scale networks. Our results demonstrate that the scheme can effectively address the identity verification challenges when applying BFT-based consensus in a permissionless blockchain. |

|**2024-05-03**|**Tokenization of Real Estate Assets Using Blockchain**|Shashank Joshi et.al.|[2405.01852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01852)| Blockchain technology is one of the key technologies that have revolutionized various facets of society, such as the banking, healthcare, and other critical ecosystems. One area that can harness the usage of blockchain is the real estate sector. The most lucrative long-term investment is real estate, followed by gold, equities, mutual funds, and savings accounts. Nevertheless, it has administrative overheads such as lack of transparency, fraud, several intermediaries, title issues, paperwork, an increasing number of arbitrations, and the lack of liquidity. This paper proposes a framework that uses blockchain as an underlying technology. With the aid of blockchain and the suite of tools, it supports many of these problems that can be alleviated in the real estate investment ecosystem. These include smart contracts, immutable record management, tokenization, record tracking, and time-stamped storage. Tokenization of real estate lowers the entry barrier by fixing liquidity and interoperability and improving the interaction between various stakeholders. |
|**2024-05-03**|**Sequencer Level Security**|Martin Derka et.al.|[2405.01819](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01819)| Current blockchains do not provide any security guarantees to the smart contracts and their users as far as the content of the transactions is concerned. In the spirit of decentralization and censorship resistance, they follow the paradigm of including valid transactions in blocks without any further scrutiny. Rollups are a special kind of blockchains whose primary purpose is to scale the transaction throughput. Many of the existing rollups operate through a centrally operated sequencing protocol. In this paper, we introduce the Sequencer Level Security (SLS) protocol, an enhancement to sequencing protocols of rollups. This pioneering contribution explores the concept of the sequencer's capability to identify and temporarily quarantine malicious transactions instead of including them in blocks immediately. We describe the mechanics of the protocol for both the transactions submitted to the rollup mempool, as well as transactions originating from Layer one. We comment on topics such as trust and decentralization, and consider the security impact on the protocol itself. We implement a prototype of the SLS protocol, Zircuit, which is built on top of Geth and the OP stack. The SLS protocol described can be easily generalized to other rollup designs, and can be used for purposes other than security. |

These light clients must maintain robust security to protect the blockchain's integrity for users of applications built upon it, achieving this with minimal resources and without significant latency. Moreover, different applications have varying security needs. This work focuses on addressing these two key requirements in the context of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains and identifying the fundamental cost-latency trade-offs to achieve tailored, optimal security for each light client.   The key security guarantee of PoS blockchains is economic (implied by the "stake"). In this paper we formalize this cryptoeconomic security to light clients, ensuring that the cost of corrupting the data provided to light clients must outweigh the potential profit, thereby economically deterring malicious actors. We further introduce "insured" cryptoeconomic security to light clients, providing unconditional protection via the attribution of adversarial actions and the consequent slashing of stakes. The divisible and fungible nature of stake facilitates programmable security, allowing for customization of the security level and insurance amount according to the specific needs of different applications.   We implemented the protocols in less than 1000 lines of Solidity and TypeScript code and evaluated their gas cost, latency, and the computational overhead. For example, for a transaction with value of \ $32k, the light client can choose between zero cost with a latency of 5 hours or instant confirmation with an insurance cost of \$ 7.45. Thus, the client can select the optimal point on the latency-cost trade-off spectrum that best aligns with its needs. Light clients require negligible storage and face minimal computational costs,... |

Is today's blockchain really decentralized? In this paper, we empirically studied one of the least decentralized parts of Ethereum -- the most used blockchain system in practice -- and shed light on the decentralization issue from a new perspective.   To avoid centralization caused by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), Ethereum adopts a novel mechanism that produces blocks through a builder market. After two years in operation, however, the builder market has evolved to a highly centralized one with three builders producing more than 90% of blocks. Why does the builder market centralize, given that it is permissionless and anyone can join? Moreover, what are the security implications of a centralized builder market to MEV-Boost auctions? Through a rigorous empirical study of the builder market's core mechanism, MEV-Boost auctions, we answered these two questions using a large-scale auction dataset we curated since 2022.   Unlike previous works that focus on who wins the auctions, we focus on why they win, to shed light on the {openness, competitiveness, and efficiency} of MEV-Boost auctions. Our findings also help identify directions for improving the decentralization of builder markets. |
|**2024-05-01**|**A Blockchain-Based Audit Mechanism for Trust and Integrity in IoT-Fog Environments**|Ismael Martinez et.al.|[2405.00844](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00844)| The full realization of smart city technology is dependent on the secure and honest collaboration between IoT applications and edge-computing. In particular, resource constrained IoT devices may rely on fog-computing to alleviate the computing load of IoT tasks. Mutual authentication is needed between IoT and fog to preserve IoT data security, and monetization of fog services is needed to promote the fog service ecosystem. However, there is no guarantee that fog nodes will always respond to IoT requests correctly, either intentionally or accidentally. In the public decentralized IoT-fog environment, it is crucial to enforce integrity among fog nodes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system that 1) streamlines the mutual authentication service monetization between IoT and fog, 2) verifies the integrity of fog nodes via service audits, and 3) discourages malicious activity and promotes honesty among fog nodes through incentives and penalties. |

As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases, artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for resource management, data processing, and knowledge acquisition. To address those issues, federated learning (FL) has introduced a novel approach to building a versatile, large-scale machine learning framework that operates in a decentralized and hardware-agnostic manner. However, FL faces network bandwidth limitations and data breaches. To reduce the central dependency in FL and increase scalability, swarm learning (SL) has been proposed in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). SL represents a decentralized machine learning framework that leverages blockchain technology for secure, scalable, and private data management. A blockchain-based network enables the exchange and aggregation of model parameters among participants, thus mitigating the risk of a single point of failure and eliminating communication bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to introduce the principles of Swarm Learning, its architectural design, and its fields of application. In addition, it highlights numerous research avenues that require further exploration by academic and industry communities to unlock the full potential and applications of SL. |
|**2024-05-01**|**A Confirmation Rule for the Ethereum Consensus Protocol**|Aditya Asgaonkar et.al.|[2405.00549](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00549)| A Confirmation Rule, within blockchain networks, refers to an algorithm implemented by network nodes that determines (either probabilistically or deterministically) the permanence of certain blocks on the blockchain. An example of Confirmation Rule is the Bitcoin's longest chain Confirmation Rule where a block is confirmed (with high probability) when it has a sufficiently long chain of successors, its siblings have notably shorter successor chains, and network synchrony holds. In this work, we devise a Confirmation Rule for Ethereum's consensus protocol, Gasper. Initially, our focus is on developing a rule specifically for LMD-GHOST, the component of Gasper responsible for ensuring dynamic availability. This is done independently of the influence of FFG-Casper, which is designed to finalize the blocks produced by LMD-GHOST. Subsequently, we build upon this rule to consider FFG-Casper's impact, aiming to achieve fast block confirmations through a heuristic that balances confirmation speed with a trade-off in safety guarantees. This refined Confirmation Rule could potentially standardize fast block confirmation within Gasper. |

Utilizing a set of open-source tools, our methodology systematically attributes price improvements to specific modifiable inputs of the system such as routing efficiency, gas optimization, and priority fee settings. When applied to leading Ethereum-based trading interfaces such as 1Inch and Uniswap, the results reveal that auction-enhanced interfaces can provide statistically significant improvements in trading outcomes, averaging 4-5 basis points in our sample. We further identify the sources of such price improvements to be added liquidity for large swaps. This research lays a foundation for future innovations in blockchain based trading platforms. |

By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust that grounds these two documents and consequently Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how governance by infrastructure is at the heart of new forms of governance and how blockchain systems are being designated as decentral by states to have recentralizing effects. The papers highlight how a mapping of discursive shifts of notions such as trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation can be a potent site to investigate redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems. |
|**2024-04-30**|**Blockchain Price vs. Quantity Controls**|Abdoulaye Ndiaye et.al.|[2405.00235](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00235)| This paper studies the optimal transaction fee mechanisms for blockchains, focusing on the distinction between price-based ( $\mathcal{P}$) and quantity-based ($\mathcal{Q}$) controls. By analyzing factors such as demand uncertainty, validator costs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations, price elasticity of demand, and levels of decentralization, we establish criteria that determine the selection of transaction fee mechanisms. We present a model framed around a Nash bargaining game, exploring how blockchain designers and validators negotiate fee structures to balance network welfare with profitability. Our findings suggest that the choice between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ mechanisms depends critically on the blockchain's specific technical and economic features. The study concludes that no single mechanism suits all contexts and highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that adaptively combine features of both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ to meet varying demands and market conditions. |
|**2024-04-30**|**Rolling in the Shadows: Analyzing the Extraction of MEV Across Layer-2 Rollups**|Christof Ferreira Torres et.al.|[2405.00138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00138)| The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks. |

However, they are renownedly affected by critical shortcomings, such as a lack of financial sustainability and operational efficiency. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have shown significant revolutionary influence in several sectors, including finance and banking, thanks to the full operational traceability they bring alongside verifiable computation. Nevertheless, the potential synergy between DLTs and CGSs has not been thoroughly investigated yet. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to utilise DLTs, particularly blockchain technologies, in CGS processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we compare key architectural characteristics considering access level, governance structure, and consensus method, to examine their fit with CGS processes. We believe this study can guide policymakers and stakeholders, thereby stimulating further innovation in this promising field. |

Currently, no globally effective method can quantify the safety, security, and Sustainability of all ASOs in orbit. Existing methods such as the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) rely on volunteering private information to provide sustainability ratings. However, the need for such sensitive data might prove to be a barrier to adoption for space entities. For effective comparison of ASOs, the rating mechanism should apply to all ASOs, even retroactively, so that the sustainability of a single ASO can be assessed holistically. Lastly, geopolitical boundaries and alignments play a crucial and limiting role in a volunteered rating system, limiting the space safety, security, and sustainability. This work presents a Live Detectability, Identifiability, and Trackability (L-DIT) score through a distributed app (dApp) built on top of the Behavioral Dynamics blockchain (BDB). The BDB chain is a space situational awareness (SSA) chain that provides verified and cross-checked ASO data from multiple sources. This unique combination of consensus-based information from BDB and permissionless access to data allows the DIT scoring method presented here to be applied to all ASOs. While the underlying BDB chain collects, filters, and validates SSA data from various open (and closed if available) sources, the L-DIT dApp consumes the data from the chain to provide L-DIT score that can contribute towards an operator's, manufacturer's, or owner's sustainability practices. Our dApp provides data for all ASOs, allowing their sustainability score to be compared against other ASOs, regardless of geopolitical alignments, providing business value to entities such as space insurance providers and enabling compliance validation and enforcement. |

Unlike any prior data source, blockchain datasets encompass multiple layers of interactions across real-world entities, e.g., human users, autonomous programs, and smart contracts. Furthermore, blockchain's integration with cryptocurrencies has introduced financial aspects of unprecedented scale and complexity such as decentralized finance, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, and central bank digital currencies. These unique characteristics present both opportunities and challenges for machine learning on blockchain data.   On one hand, we examine the state-of-the-art solutions, applications, and future directions associated with leveraging machine learning for blockchain data analysis critical for the improvement of blockchain technology such as e-crime detection and trends prediction. On the other hand, we shed light on the pivotal role of blockchain by providing vast datasets and tools that can catalyze the growth of the evolving machine learning ecosystem. This paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, offering a roadmap for navigating this dynamic and transformative field. |

The current lack of incentives and transparency harms the credibility of this process. Researchers are neither rewarded for superior nor penalized for bad reviews. Additionally, confidential reports cause a loss of insights and make the review process vulnerable to scientific misconduct. We propose a community-owned and -governed system that 1) remunerates reviewers for their efforts, 2) publishes the (anonymized) reports for scrutiny by the community, 3) tracks reputation of reviewers and 4) provides digital certificates. Automated by transparent smart-contract blockchain technology, the system aims to increase quality and speed of peer review while lowering the chance and impact of erroneous judgements. |

The ongoing quest to exploit vulnerabilities emphasizes how critical it is to expand on current research initiatives. Thus, using a methodology based on discrete blockchain layers, our survey study aims to broaden the existing body of knowledge by thoroughly discussing both new and known attack vectors inside the blockchain ecosystem. This survey proposes a novel classification of blockchain attacks and an in-depth investigation of blockchain data security. In particular, the paper provides a thorough discussion of the attack techniques and vulnerabilities that are specific to each tier, along with a detailed look at mitigating techniques. We reveal the deep dynamics of these security concerns by closely investigating the fundamental causes of attacks at various blockchain tiers. We clarify mitigation methods for known vulnerabilities and offer new information on recently developed attack vectors. We also discuss the implications of quantum computing in blockchain and the weaknesses in the current technology that can be exploited in the future. Our study advances the field of blockchain security and privacy research while also contributing to our understanding of blockchain vulnerabilities and attacks. This survey paper is a useful tool for readers who want to learn more about the intricacies of blockchain security. It also invites researchers to help strengthen blockchain privacy and security, paving the way for further developments in this dynamic and ever-evolving field. |
|**2024-04-27**|**Solvent: liquidity verification of smart contracts**|Massimo Bartoletti et.al.|[2404.17864](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17864)| Smart contracts are programs executed by blockchains networks to regulate the exchange of crypto-assets between untrusted users. Due to their immutability, public accessibility and high value at stake, smart contracts are an attractive target for attackers, as evidenced by a long history of security incidents. This has been a driving factor for the application of formal methods to Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, and Solidity, its main smart contract language, which have become the target of dozens of verification tools with varying objectives. A current limitation of these tools is that they are not really effective in expressing and verifying liquidity properties regarding the exchange of crypto-assets: for example, is it true that in every reachable state a user can fire a sequence of transactions to withdraw a given amount of crypto-assets? We propose Solvent, a tool aimed at verifying these kinds of properties, which are beyond the reach of existing verification tools for Solidity. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Solvent through a common benchmark of smart contracts. |

Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level.   To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a contrastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training process of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all baseline methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods. |

With the exponential growth of transactions in the realm of Blockchain, especially in Bitcoin, Blockchain size increases as all transactions must be stored and verified. In Bitcoin, validating M of N transactions involves the necessity of M authentic signatures out of the total N transactions. This procedure is so time-consuming and needs a significant storage capacity. To address these issues, several multi signature schemes have been proposed, enabling users to interactively generate a common signature on a single message. Recently, some lattice based multi signature schemes have been presented to deal with the threats of quantum computers. However, none of them have met all desirable features of multi signature schemes like aggregate public key, low numbers of communication rounds, or resistant to quantum computers. Within this paper, we present a new multi signature scheme based on lattices, known as Razhims, that has aggregate public key, necessitates solely a single round of communication, and is resistant to quantum computers. In Razhims, the aggregate public key size and the final signature size are equal to the public key size and the final signature size of a standard signature respectively, and are independent of the number of signers. |

However, cloud security concerns introduce new risks and challenges related to data protection, sharing, and access control. A synergistic integration of blockchain with the cloud holds immense potential. Blockchain's distributed ledger ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency as it reduces the reliance on centralized authorities. Motivated by this, our framework proposes a secure data ecosystem in the cloud with the key aspects being Data Rights, Data Sharing, and Data Validation. Also, this approach aims to increase its interoperability and scalability by eliminating the need for data migration. This will ensure that existing public cloud-based systems can easily deploy blockchain enhancing trustworthiness and non-repudiation of cloud data. |

Yet, user privacy is at risk due to frequent data collection. Existing privacy schemes face vulnerability with quantum machines. To tackle this, the LPM2DA scheme is introduced, utilizing lattice-based encryption and signatures for secure data aggregation. It ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication, enabling statistical analysis while preserving user privacy. Traditional aggregation schemes suffer from weak network models and centralization issues. Enter SPDBlock, a blockchain-based solution ensuring privacy, integrity, and resistance to attacks. It detects and prosecutes malicious entities while efficiently handling multi-dimensional data transmission. Through distributed decryption and secret sharing, only valid data can be decrypted with minimal involvement from smart meters. Performance tests reveal SPDBlock's superiority in communication and computational efficiency over traditional schemes. |

The installation of such sources, like photovoltaic panels, while environmentally beneficial, is cost-prohibitive for many. Those lacking photovoltaic solutions typically resort to purchasing energy from utility grids that often rely on fossil fuels. Moreover, when users produce their own energy, they may generate excess that goes unused, leading to inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes innovative blockchain-enabled energy-sharing algorithms that allow consumers -- without financial means -- to access energy through the use of their own energy storage units. We explore two sharing models: a centralized method and a peer-to-peer (P2P) one. Our analysis reveals that the P2P model is more effective, enhancing the sharing process significantly compared to the centralized method. We also demonstrate that, when contrasted with traditional battery-supported trading algorithm, the P2P sharing algorithm substantially reduces wasted energy and energy purchases from the grid by 73.6%, and 12.3% respectively. The proposed system utilizes smart contracts to decentralize its structure, address the single point of failure concern, improve overall system transparency, and facilitate peer-to-peer payments. |

This mechanism aims to reduce the voting power of validators who are unreachable within the network, reallocating this power to active validators. This paper investigates the implications of the inactivity leak on safety within the Ethereum blockchain. Our theoretical analysis reveals scenarios where actions by Byzantine validators expedite the finalization of two conflicting branches, and instances where Byzantine validators reach a voting power exceeding the critical safety threshold of one-third. Additionally, we revisit the probabilistic bouncing attack, illustrating how the inactivity leak can result in a probabilistic breach of safety, potentially allowing Byzantine validators to exceed the one-third safety threshold. Our findings uncover how penalizing inactive nodes can compromise blockchain properties, particularly in the presence of Byzantine validators capable of coordinating actions. |

An off-chain storage layer, which lies between the application and the blockchain layers, can improve space efficiency and data availability with erasure codes and decentralized maintenance. This paper presents two fundamental components of such storage layer designed and implemented for the IPFS network. The IPFS Community is a component built on top of the IPFS network that encodes and decodes data before uploading to the network. Since data is encoded with alpha entanglement codes, the solution requires less storage space than the native IPFS solution which replicates data by pinning content with the IPFS Cluster. To detect and repair failures in a timely manner, we introduce the monitoring and repair component. This novel component is activated by any node and distributes the load of repairs among various nodes. These two components are implemented as pluggable modules, and can, therefore, be easily migrated to other distributed file systems by adjusting the connector component. |
|**2024-04-24**|**A Rollup Comparison Framework**|Jan Gorzny et.al.|[2404.16150](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16150)| Rollups are a popular blockchain paradigm where one blockchain network is anchored to a different blockchain network, typically though smart contracts and data commitments. The rollup executes transactions on its own network and periodically publishes them along with the state root of the rollup network. The state root is determined to be final by a protocol, often enforced by smart contracts on the anchoring blockchain, which may let the state roots be challenged or verify an accompanying validity proof. While this core functionality is universal to existing rollups, these systems have introduced unique features as they vie for users and market dominance. In this paper, we aim to classify ways in which these rollups differ in order to establish a common ground of understanding. We explore various dimensions in which these system can differ: familiarity, finality time, modularity, and maturity. The result is a framework that can be used to understand and compare the properties of rollups. |

However, the commonly deployed PoW implementations are all based on solving cryptographic puzzles. Researchers have been pursuing the compelling idea of replacing cryptopuzzles with useful computing tasks for over a decade, in face of the substantial computational capacity of blockchain networks and the global pursuit of a more sustainable IT infrastructure. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prerequisites for alternative classes of tasks. We provide insight into the effect of introducing "usefulness" and of transitioning to task classes other than cryptopuzzles. Having distilled the prerequisites, we use them to examine proposed designs from existing literature. Finally, we discuss pertinent techniques and present research gaps in the current state-of-the-art. |

Opaque, centralized services that compelled trust from users are replaced by trustless, decentralized systems of smart contracts. However, the public nature of blockchain-based databases, on which smart contracts transact, has typically presented a challenge for applications that depend on data privacy or that rely on participants having incomplete information. This has changed with the introduction of confidential smart contract networks that encrypt the memory state of active contracts as well as their databases stored on-chain. With confidentiality, contracts can more readily implement novel interaction mechanisms that were previously infeasible. Meanwhile, in both Web 2.0 and Web3 applications the user interface continues to play a crucial role in translating user intent into actionable requests. In many cases, developers have shifted intelligence and autonomy into the client-side, leveraging Web technologies for compute, graphics, and networking. Web3's reliance on such frontends has revealed a pain point though, namely that decentralized applications are not accessible to end users without a persistent host serving the application. Here we introduce the Non-Fungible Program (NFP) model for developing self-contained frontend applications that are distributed via blockchain, powered by Web technology, and backed by private databases persisted in encrypted smart contracts. Access to frontend code, as well as backend services, is controlled and guaranteed by smart contracts according to the NFT ownership model, eliminating the need for a separate host. By extension, NFP applications bring interactivity to token owners and enable new functionalities, such as authorization mechanisms for oracles, supplementary Web services, and overlay networks in a secure manner.

However, data in the medical field is often highly private, preventing different hospitals from sharing data to train an accurate model. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving machine learning architecture, has shown promising performance in balancing data privacy and model utility by keeping private data on the client's side and using a central server to coordinate a set of clients for model training through aggregating their uploaded model parameters. Yet, this architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party server, which is challenging to achieve in real life. Swarm learning, as a specialized decentralized federated learning architecture that does not require a central server, utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct parameter exchanges between clients. However, the mining of blocks requires significant computational resources, limiting its scalability. To address this issue, this paper integrates the brain storm optimization algorithm into the swarm learning framework, named BSO-SL. This approach clusters similar clients into different groups based on their model distributions. Additionally, leveraging the architecture of BSO, clients are given the probability to engage in collaborative learning both within their cluster and with clients outside their cluster, preventing the model from converging to local optima. The proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. |
|**2024-04-23**|**Correlations versus noise in the NFT market**|Marcin Wątorek et.al.|[2404.15495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15495)| The non-fungible token (NFT) market emerges as a recent trading innovation leveraging blockchain technology, mirroring the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. To deepen the understanding of the dynamics of this market, in the current study, based on the capitalization changes and transaction volumes across a large number of token collections on the Ethereum platform, the degree of correlation in this market is examined by using the multivariate formalism of detrended correlation coefficient and correlation matrix. It appears that correlation strength is lower here than that observed in previously studied markets. Consequently, the eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrix more closely follow the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, still, some departures indicating the existence of correlations remain. The comparison of results obtained from the correlation matrix built from the Pearson coefficients and, independently, from the detrended cross-correlation coefficients suggests that the global correlations in the NFT market arise from higher frequency fluctuations. Corresponding minimal spanning trees (MSTs) for capitalization variability exhibit a scale-free character while, for the number of transactions, they are somewhat more decentralized. |

This concept refers to Internet of Things (IoT), bringing information and control capabilities in many fields like medicine, smart homes, home security, etc. Main drawbacks of IoT environment are its dependency on Internet connectivity and need continuous devices power. These dependencies may affect system performances, namely request processing response times. In this context, we propose in this paper a continuous performance monitoring methodology, applied on IoT systems based on Publish/subscribe communication model. Our approach assesses performances using Stochastic Petri net modeling, and self-optimizes whenever poor performances are detected. Our approach relies on a Stochastic Petri nets modelling and analysis to assess performances. We target improving performances, in particular response times, by online modification of influencing factors. |

While many runtime monitoring and guarding mechanisms have been proposed to validate invariants and stop anomalous transactions on the fly, the empirical effectiveness of the invariants used remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we studied 23 prevalent invariants of 8 categories, which are either deployed in high-profile protocols or endorsed by leading auditing firms and security experts. Using these well-established invariants as templates, we developed a tool Trace2Inv which dynamically generates new invariants customized for a given contract based on its historical transaction data.   We evaluated Trace2Inv on 42 smart contracts that fell victim to 27 distinct exploits on the Ethereum blockchain. Our findings reveal that the most effective invariant guard alone can successfully block 18 of the 27 identified exploits with minimal gas overhead. Our analysis also shows that most of the invariants remain effective even when the experienced attackers attempt to bypass them. Additionally, we studied the possibility of combining multiple invariant guards, resulting in blocking up to 23 of the 27 benchmark exploits and achieving false positive rates as low as 0.32%. Trace2Inv outperforms current state-of-the-art works on smart contract invariant mining and transaction attack detection in terms of both practicality and accuracy. Though Trace2Inv is not primarily designed for transaction attack detection, it surprisingly found two previously unreported exploit transactions, earlier than any reported exploit transactions against the same victim contracts. |

Users are able to orchestrate the whole blockchain network using a single web based interface, for example they are able to set the topology of the peer-to-peer (P2P) connections and control the initialization parameters. Each Raspberry Pi has a screen attached which visualizes current state of local blockchain, allowing users to easily visualize the consensus of the network in real time. We show how this platform can be used to perform experiments on consensus quality while using different P2P topologies. Similar experiments can be used for demonstration purposes in a workshop or other educational settings. |
|**2024-04-27**|**Frosty: Bringing strong liveness guarantees to the Snow family of consensus protocols**|Aaron Buchwald et.al.|[2404.14250](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14250)| Snowman is the consensus protocol implemented by the Avalanche blockchain and is part of the Snow family of protocols, first introduced through the original Avalanche leaderless consensus protocol. A major advantage of Snowman is that each consensus decision only requires an expected constant communication overhead per processor in the `common' case that the protocol is not under substantial Byzantine attack, i.e. it provides a solution to the scalability problem which ensures that the expected communication overhead per processor is independent of the total number of processors $n$ during normal operation. This is the key property that would enable a consensus protocol to scale to 10,000 or more independent validators (i.e. processors). On the other hand, the two following concerns have remained:   (1) Providing formal proofs of consistency for Snowman has presented a formidable challenge.   (2) Liveness attacks exist in the case that a Byzantine adversary controls more than $O(\sqrt{n})$ processors, slowing termination to more than a logarithmic number of steps.   In this paper, we address the two issues above. We consider a Byzantine adversary that controls at most $f<n/5$ processors. First, we provide a simple proof of consistency for Snowman. Then we supplement Snowman with a `liveness module' that can be triggered in the case that a substantial adversary launches a liveness attack, and which guarantees liveness in this event by temporarily forgoing the communication complexity advantages of Snowman, but without sacrificing these low communication complexity advantages during normal operation. |

The current course selection systems face various issues, which can be mitigated through the implementation of blockchain technology. The advantages of blockchain technology, including consensus mechanisms and smart contracts, are discussed in detail. The token voting mechanism, encompassing concepts, token issuance and distribution, and voting rules and procedures, is also explained. The system design takes into account the system architecture, user roles and permissions, course information on the blockchain, student course selection voting process, and course selection result statistics and public display. The technology offers advantages such as transparency, fairness, data security and privacy protection, and system efficiency improvement. However, it also poses several challenges, such as technological and regulatory hurdles. The prospects for the application of blockchain token voting technology in student course selection systems and its potential impact on other fields are summarized. Overall, the utilization of blockchain token voting technology in student course selection systems holds promising future implications, which could revolutionize the education sector. |

To solve the problem that blockchain systems cannot access off-chain data, oracle is introduced. however, existing research mainly focuses on the consistency and integrity of data, but ignores the problem that oracle nodes may be externally attacked or provide false data for selfish motives, resulting in the unresolved problem of data accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized testing architecture (DesTest) that aims to improve data accuracy. A blockchain oracle random secret testing mechanism is first proposed to enhance the monitoring and verification of nodes by introducing a dynamic anonymized question-verification committee. Based on this, a comprehensive evaluation incentive mechanism is designed to incentivize honest work performance by evaluating nodes based on their reputation scores. The simulation results show that we successfully reduced the discrete entropy value of the acquired data and the real value of the data by 61.4%. |

The operation of blockchain is governed by consensus algorithms, among which Proof of Stake (PoS) is popular yet has its drawbacks, notably the potential for centralising power in nodes with larger stakes or higher rewards. Fuzzychain, our proposed solution, introduces the use of fuzzy sets to define stake semantics, promoting decentralised and distributed processing control. This system selects validators based on their degree of membership to the stake fuzzy sets rather than just the size of their stakes. As a pioneer proposal in applying fuzzy sets to blockchain, Fuzzychain aims to rectify PoS's limitations. Our results indicate that Fuzzychain not only matches PoS in functionality but also ensures a fairer distribution of stakes among validators, leading to more inclusive validator selection and a better-distributed network. |

To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps) domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to existing baselines |

Despite their widespread use, a comprehensive understanding of the probabilistic aspects of data security in these structures remains a gap in current research. Our study aims to bridge this gap by developing a theoretical framework to calculate the probability of data falsification, taking into account various scenarios based on the length of the Merkle path and hash length. The research progresses from the derivation of an exact formula for falsification probability to an approximation suitable for cases with significantly large hash lengths. Empirical experiments validate the theoretical models, exploring simulations with diverse hash lengths and Merkle path lengths. The findings reveal a decrease in falsification probability with increasing hash length and an inverse relationship with longer Merkle paths. A numerical analysis quantifies the discrepancy between exact and approximate probabilities, underscoring the conditions for the effective application of the approximation. This work offers crucial insights into optimizing Merkle Tree structures for bolstering security in blockchain and IoT systems, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and data integrity. |

This paper explores the integration of blockchain technology in biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger and tokenization affordances, presents a groundbreaking solution for the accurate monitoring and tracking of environmental assets, thereby addressing the critical need for transparency and trust in conservation efforts. Unlike previous more theoretical approaches, by addressing the research question of how blockchain supports digital resilience in biodiversity conservation, this study presents a grounded framework that justifies which blockchain features are essential to decipher specific data contribution and data leveraging processes in an effort to protect our planet's biodiversity, while boosting potential economic benefits for all actors involved, from local farmers, to hardware vendors and artificial intelligence experts, to investors and regular users, volunteers and donors. |

By employing blockchain for security and integrity, DeFi creates new possibilities that attract retail and institution users, including central banks. Given its novel applications and sophisticated designs, the distinction between DeFi services and understanding the risk involved is often complex. This work systematically presents the major categories of DeFi protocols that cover over 90\% of total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. It establishes a structured methodology to differentiate between DeFi protocols based on their design and architecture. Every DeFi protocol is classified into one of three groups: liquidity pools, pegged and synthetic tokens, and aggregator protocols, followed by risk analysis. In particular, we classify stablecoins, liquid staking tokens, and bridged (wrapped) assets as pegged tokens resembling similar risks. The full risk exposure of DeFi users is derived not only from the DeFi protocol design but also from how it is used and with which tokens. |

While some rollups performed well, some others experienced downtime during this period, affecting transaction finality time and gas fees. To address the lack of empirical research on rollups, we perform the first study during a heightened activity during the late 2023 transaction boom, as attributed to inscriptions - a novel technique that enables NFT and ERC-20 token creation on Bitcoin and other blockchains. We observe that minting inscription-based meme tokens on zkSync Era allows for trading at a fraction of the costs, compared to the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. We also found that the increased transaction activity, over 99% attributed to the minting of new inscription tokens, positively affected other users of zkSync Era, resulting in lowered gas fees. Unlike L1 blockchains, ZK rollups may experience lower gas fees with increased transaction volume. Lastly, the introduction of blobs - a form of temporary data storage - decreased the gas costs of Ethereum rollups, but also raised a number of questions about the security of inscription-based tokens. |
|**2024-04-17**|**Do you need a DAO?**|Henrik Axelsen et.al.|[2404.11076](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11076)| Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have seen exponential growth and interest due to their potential to redefine organizational structure and governance. Despite this, there is a discrepancy between the ideals of autonomy and decentralization and the actual experiences of DAO stakeholders. The Information Systems (IS) literature has yet to fully explore whether DAOs are the optimal organizational choice. Addressing this gap, our research asks, "Is a DAO suitable for your organizational needs?" We derive a gated decision-making framework through a thematic review of the academic and grey literature on DAOs. Through five scenarios, the framework critically emphasizes the gaps between DAOs' theoretical capabilities and practical challenges. Our findings contribute to the IS discourse on blockchain technologies, with some ancillary contributions to the IS literature on organizational management and practitioner literature. |

This tutorial explores FL and BC integration, offering a secure and privacy-preserving approach to healthcare analytics. FL enables decentralized model training on local devices at healthcare institutions, keeping patient data localized. This facilitates collaborative model development without compromising privacy. However, FL introduces vulnerabilities. BC, with its tamper-proof ledger and smart contracts, provides a robust framework for secure collaborative learning in FL. After presenting a taxonomy for the various types of data used in ML in medical applications, and a concise review of ML techniques for healthcare use cases, this tutorial explores three integration architectures for balancing decentralization, scalability, and reliability in healthcare data. Furthermore, it investigates how BCFL enhances data security and collaboration in disease prediction, medical image analysis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery. By providing a tutorial on FL, blockchain, and their integration, along with a review of BCFL applications, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage these technologies for secure and privacy-preserving healthcare ML. It aims to accelerate advancements in secure and collaborative healthcare analytics, ultimately improving patient outcomes. |

PoS-based blockchains require an initial stake distribution among the participants. Typically, this initial stake distribution is called bootstrapping. This paper argues that existing bootstrapping protocols are prone to centralization. To address centralization due to bootstrapping, we propose a novel game $\Gamma_\textsf{bootstrap}$. Next, we define three conditions: (i) Individual Rationality (IR), (ii) Incentive Compatibility (IC), and (iii) $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)-$ Decentralization that an \emph{ideal} bootstrapping protocol must satisfy. $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)$ are certain parameters to quantify decentralization. Towards this, we propose a novel centralization metric, C-NORM, to measure centralization in a PoS System. We define a centralization game -- $\Gamma_\textsf{cent}$ , to analyze the efficacy of centralization metrics. We show that C-NORM effectively captures centralization in the presence of strategic players capable of launching Sybil attacks. With C-NORM, we analyze popular bootstrapping protocols such as Airdrop and Proof-of-Burn (PoB) and prove that they do not satisfy IC and IR, respectively. Motivated by the Ethereum Merge, we study W2SB (a PoW-based bootstrapping protocol) and prove it is ideal. In addition, we conduct synthetic simulations to empirically validate that W2SB bootstrapped PoS is decentralized. |

To improve scalability, researchers have turned to the study of cross-chain state channels. However, most of the existing schemes rely on trusted parties to support channel operations. To address this issue, we present Interpipe: a distributed cross-chain state channel scheme. Specifically, we propose a real-time cross-chain synchronization scheme to ensure consistent operations between two blockchains to a cross-chain state channel. Moreover, we propose a batch transaction proof scheme based on recursive SNARK to meet the cross-chain verification needs of large-scale users. Based on the above designs, Interpipe offers protocols for opening, updating, closing, and disputing operations to cross-chain state channels. Security analysis shows that Interpipe has consistency and resistance, and experimental results demonstrate that a cross-chain state channel can be nearly as efficient as an existing intra-chain state channel. |

Design decisions are detailed and challenges are addressed. The architecture is being implemented using Golang and can be run inside the CbmRoot software environment. The goal is to build a bridge between the disciplines HEP and blockchain to build a novel blockchain network in which the network's computational power is not wasted but instead used to support a scientific experiment while at the same time securing the underlying permissioned blockchain. The blockchain features a token-based cryptocurrency that is rewarded to miners that donate computational power and acts as an additional incentive to participate which traditional volunteer computing can not provide. The implementation named gophy is being implemented in Golang and is expected to be open-sourced before the end of 2024. |

Adaptor signatures are a recent cryptographic primitive and are becoming an important tool for blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies to reduce on-chain costs, improve fungibility, and contribute to off-chain forms of payment in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, currently used adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum adversaries due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$ , a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, as the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, show that our scheme is secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). |
|**2024-06-04**|**Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security**|Zishuo Zhao et.al.|[2404.09005](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005)| Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$ . Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age. |

By utilizing an extensive dataset of 3,576 fan token polls, we reveal that fan tokens engage an average of 4,003 participants per poll, representing around 50% of token holders, underscoring their relative effectiveness in boosting fan engagement. The analyses identify significant determinants of fan token poll participation, including levels of voter (dis-)agreement, poll type, sports sectors, demographics, and club-level factors. This study provides valuable stakeholder insights into the current state of adoption and voting trends for fan token polls. It also suggests strategies for increasing fan engagement, thereby optimizing the utility of fan tokens in sports. Moreover, we highlight the broader applicability of fan token principles to any community, brand, or organization focused on customer engagement, suggesting a wider potential for this digital innovation. |

By employing numerous Mobile AIGC Service Providers (MASPs), ubiquitous and low-latency AIGC services for clients can be realized. Nonetheless, the interactions between clients and MASPs in public mobile networks, pertaining to three key mechanisms, namely MASP selection, payment scheme, and fee-ownership transfer, are unprotected. In this paper, we design the above mechanisms using a systematic approach and present the first blockchain to protect mobile AIGC, called ProSecutor. Specifically, by roll-up and layer-2 channels, ProSecutor forms a two-layer architecture, realizing tamper-proof data recording and atomic fee-ownership transfer with high resource efficiency. Then, we present the Objective-Subjective Service Assessment (OS^{2}A) framework, which effectively evaluates the AIGC services by fusing the objective service quality with the reputation-based subjective experience of the service outcome (i.e., AIGC outputs). Deploying OS^{2}A on ProSecutor, firstly, the MASP selection can be realized by sorting the reputation. Afterward, the contract theory is adopted to optimize the payment scheme and help clients avoid moral hazards in mobile networks. We implement the prototype of ProSecutor on BlockEmulator.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProSecutor achieves 12.5x throughput and saves 67.5\% storage resources compared with BlockEmulator. Moreover, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanisms are validated. |

We propose DeFaaS, a decentralized FaaS system leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized API management. DeFaaS addresses these limitations by establishing a secure, transparent registry of functions on a blockchain and enabling applications to discover and invoke them. This approach fosters scalability, flexibility, enhanced security, and improved reliability. Furthermore, DeFaaS's architecture extends beyond decentralized FaaS, supporting other distributed computing scenarios like dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service meshes. DeFaaS represents a significant advancement in decentralized computing with the potential to unlock a multitude of novel applications and use cases. |

Through integration with mobile edge networks, mobile AIGC networks have gained significant attention, which can provide real-time customized and personalized AIGC services and products. Since blockchains can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management, AIGC products can be securely managed by blockchain to avoid tampering and plagiarization. However, the evolution of blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as improving information propagation efficiency to enable blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based information propagation optimization framework for blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. We first innovatively apply age of information as a data-freshness metric to measure information propagation efficiency in public blockchains. Considering that GATs possess the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT to obtain the optimal information propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding information propagation efficiency compared with traditional routing mechanisms. |

By leveraging cryptographic proof mechanisms, Bitcoin eliminates the reliance on third-party financial institutions. Ethereum, ranking as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, builds upon Bitcoin's groundwork by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum strives to surpass the limitations of Bitcoin's scripting language, achieving full Turing-completeness for executing intricate computational tasks. Solana introduces a novel architecture for high-performance blockchain, employing timestamps to validate decentralized transactions and significantly boosting block creation throughput. Through a comprehensive examination of these blockchain technologies, their distinctions, and the associated challenges, this paper aims to offer valuable insights and comparative analysis for both researchers and practitioners. |
|**2024-04-06**|**Towards a low carbon proof-of-work blockchain**|Agron Gemajli et.al.|[2404.04729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04729)| Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains burn a lot of energy. Proof-of-work algorithms are expensive by design and often only serve to compute blockchains. In some sense, carbon-based and non-carbon based regional electric power is fungible. So the total carbon and non-carbon electric power mix plays a role. Thus, generally PoW algorithms have large CO $_2$ footprints solely for computing blockchains. A proof of technology is described towards replacing hashcash or other PoW methods with a lottery and proof-of-VM (PoVM) emulation. PoVM emulation is a form of PoW where an autonomous blockchain miner gets a lottery ticket in exchange for providing a VM (virtual Machine) for a specified period. These VMs get their jobs from a job queue. Managing and ensuring, by concensus, that autonomous PoVMs are properly configured and running as expected gives several gaps for a complete practical system. These gaps are discussed. Our system is similar to a number of other blockchain systems. We briefly survey these systems. This paper along with our proof of technology was done as a senior design project. |

We investigate the stability of blockchain sharding, where transactions are continuously generated by an adversarial model. The system consists of $n$ processing nodes that are divided into $s$ shards. Following the paradigm of classical adversarial queuing theory, transactions are continuously received at injection rate $\rho \leq 1$ and burstiness $b > 0$. We give an absolute upper bound $\max\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{ \left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\}$ on the maximum injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and latency of transactions, where $k$ is the number of shards that each transaction accesses. We next give a basic distributed scheduling algorithm for uniform systems where shards are equally close to each other. To guarantee stability, the injection rate is limited to $\rho \leq \max\{ \frac{1}{18k}, \frac{1}{\lceil 18 \sqrt{s} \rceil} \}$. We then provide a fully distributed scheduling algorithm for non-uniform systems where shards are arbitrarily far from each other. By using a hierarchical clustering of the shards, stability is guaranteed with injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{c_1d \log^2 s} \cdot \max\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \}$, where $d$ is the worst distance of any transaction to the shards it will access, and $c_1$ is some positive constant. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the algorithms and measure the average queue sizes and latency throughout the system. To our knowledge, this is the first adversarial stability analysis of sharded blockchain systems. |
|**2024-04-05**|**Smart Contract Languages: a comparative analysis**|Massimo Bartoletti et.al.|[2404.04129](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04129)| Decentralized blockchain platforms support the secure exchange of assets among users without relying on trusted third parties. These exchanges are programmed with smart contracts, computer programs directly executed by blockchain nodes. Multiple smart contract languages are available nowadays to developers, each with its own distinctive features, strengths, and weaknesses. In this paper, we examine the smart contract languages used in six major blockchain platforms: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, Aptos, and Tezos. Starting with a high-level overview of their design choices, we provide a comprehensive assessment that focuses on programming style, security, code readability, and usability, drawing on an original benchmark that encompasses a common set of use cases across all the smart contract languages under examination. |
|**2024-04-05**|**VELLET: Verifiable Embedded Wallet for Securing Authenticity and Integrity**|Hiroki Watanabe et.al.|[2404.03874](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03874)| The blockchain ecosystem, particularly with the rise of Web3 and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), has experienced a significant increase in users and applications. However, this expansion is challenged by the need to connect early adopters with a wider user base. A notable difficulty in this process is the complex interfaces of blockchain wallets, which can be daunting for those familiar with traditional payment methods. To address this issue, the category of "embedded wallets" has emerged as a promising solution. These wallets are seamlessly integrated into the front-end of decentralized applications (Dapps), simplifying the onboarding process for users and making access more widely available. However, our insights indicate that this simplification introduces a trade-off between ease of use and security. Embedded wallets lack transparency and auditability, leading to obscured transactions by the front end and a pronounced risk of fraud and phishing attacks. This paper proposes a new protocol to enhance the security of embedded wallets. Our VELLET protocol introduces a wallet verifier that can match the audit trail of embedded wallets on smart contracts, incorporating a process to verify authenticity and integrity. In the implementation architecture of the VELLET protocol, we suggest using the Text Record feature of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), known as a decentralized domain name service, to serve as a repository for managing the audit trails of smart contracts. This approach has been demonstrated to reduce the necessity for new smart contract development and operational costs, proving cost-effective through a proof-of-concept. This protocol is a vital step in reducing security risks associated with embedded wallets, ensuring their convenience does not undermine user security and trust. |

Zero Knowledge Login allows users to create and access their blockchain wallets just with their OAuth accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitch), while Sponsored Transactions eliminate the need for users to prepare transaction fees, as they can delegate fees to sponsors' accounts. Additionally, thanks to Sui's Storage Rebate feature, sponsors in Sponsored Transactions can profit from the sponsorship, achieving a win-win and sustainable service model. Zero Knowledge Login and Sponsored Transactions are pivotal in overcoming key challenges novice blockchain users face, particularly in managing private keys and depositing initial transaction fees. By addressing these challenges in the user experience of blockchain, Sui makes the blockchain more accessible and engaging for novice users and paves the way for the broader adoption of blockchain applications in everyday life. |

Developing a Generalizable Approach for Identifying Bottlenecks in Permissioned Blockchains**|Orestis Papageorgiou et.al.|[2404.02930](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02930)| Permissioned blockchains have been proposed for a variety of use cases that require decentralization yet address enterprise requirements that permissionless blockchains to date cannot satisfy -- particularly in terms of performance. However, popular permissioned blockchains still exhibit a relatively low maximum throughput in comparison to established centralized systems. Consequently, researchers have conducted several benchmarking studies on different permissioned blockchains to identify their limitations and -- in some cases -- their bottlenecks in an attempt to find avenues for improvement. Yet, these approaches are highly heterogeneous, difficult to compare, and require a high level of expertise in the implementation of the underlying specific blockchain. In this paper, we develop a more unified and graphical approach for identifying bottlenecks in permissioned blockchains based on a systematic review of related work, experiments with the Distributed Ledger Performance Scan (DLPS), and an extension of its graphical evaluation functionalities. We conduct in-depth case studies on Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum, two widely used permissioned blockchains with distinct architectural designs, demonstrating the adaptability of our framework across different blockchains. We provide researchers and practitioners working on evaluating or improving permissioned blockchains with a toolkit, guidelines on what data to document, and insights on how to proceed in the search process for bottlenecks. |
|**2024-04-03**|**The Societal Implications of Blockchain Proliferation**|Cory Cherven et.al.|[2404.02451](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02451)| Blockchain and its distributed ledger technology have far-reaching implications for consumers across the world. Cryptocurrencies like XRP work to solve key issues in the remittance industry, targeting corridors like Mexico where foreign remittance fuels economies. Blockchain's libertarian principles have the potential to change lives in the third world, replacing corrupt infrastructure with trust-based solutions. While this technology can be used to significantly improve lives, it has a wealth of destructive applications. Bitcoin's blockchain and nefarious websites like the Silk Road have fueled an underground market of drugs, money laundering, and terrorism, complicating digital currency legislation. The negative environmental effects of cryptocurrency may also contribute significantly to global climate change. Negatives aside, cryptocurrency still proves to be a valuable commodity in technological development. |

First, we expand the existing framework for collaborative dictionary learning (CollabDict), which has previously been limited to Gaussian mixture models, by incorporating deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) into the framework, with a particular focus on anomaly detection. We demonstrate that the VAE-based anomaly score function shares the same mathematical structure as the non-deep model, and provide comprehensive qualitative comparison. Second, considering the widespread use of "pre-trained models," we provide a mathematical analysis on data privacy leakage when models trained with CollabDict are shared externally. We show that the CollabDict approach, when applied to Gaussian mixtures, adheres to a Renyi differential privacy criterion. Additionally, we propose a practical metric for monitoring internal privacy breaches during the learning process. |

They emerged as a preferred method of staking within Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, owing to their ease of use and tradability. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we establish a general framework describing the design choices and protocols underlying liquid staking. We then employ the framework to systematically compare the top LST implementations, examining their node operator selection, validator operations, and staking rewards distribution models. We further discuss security concerns associated with liquid staking, its implications for PoS blockchain security, and Distributed Validator technology (DVT) as a potential solution. Finally, we empirically analyze LSTs' performance and find that the design choices and market events affect peg stability; particularly, LSTs with centralized governance and operations are more efficient in tracking staking rewards. |
|**2024-05-30**|**Eclipse Attack Detection on a Blockchain Network as a Non-Parametric Change Detection Problem**|Anurag Gupta et.al.|[2404.00538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00538)| This paper introduces a novel non-parametric change detection algorithm to identify eclipse attacks on a blockchain network; the non-parametric algorithm relies only on the empirical mean and variance of the dataset, making it highly adaptable. An eclipse attack occurs when malicious actors isolate blockchain users, disrupting their ability to reach consensus with the broader network, thereby distorting their local copy of the ledger. To detect an eclipse attack, we monitor changes in the Fr\'echet mean and variance of the evolving blockchain communication network connecting blockchain users. First, we leverage the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to project large-dimensional networks into a lower-dimensional space, preserving essential statistical properties. Subsequently, we employ a non-parametric change detection procedure, leading to a test statistic that converges weakly to a Brownian bridge process in the absence of an eclipse attack. This enables us to quantify the false alarm rate of the detector. Our detector can be implemented as a smart contract on the blockchain, offering a tamper-proof and reliable solution. Finally, we use numerical examples to compare the proposed eclipse attack detector with a detector based on the random forest model. |
|**2024-04-05**|**Blockchain for Energy Market: A Comprehensive Survey**|Tianqi Jiang et.al.|[2403.20045](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20045)| The energy market encompasses the behavior of energy supply and trading within a platform system. By utilizing centralized or distributed trading, energy can be effectively managed and distributed across different regions, thereby achieving market equilibrium and satisfying both producers and consumers. However, recent years have presented unprecedented challenges and difficulties for the development of the energy market. These challenges include regional energy imbalances, volatile energy pricing, high computing costs, and issues related to transaction information disclosure. Researchers widely acknowledge that the security features of blockchain technology can enhance the efficiency of energy transactions and establish the fundamental stability and robustness of the energy market. This type of blockchain-enabled energy market is commonly referred to as an energy blockchain. Currently, there is a burgeoning amount of research in this field, encompassing algorithm design, framework construction, and practical application. It is crucial to organize and compare these research efforts to facilitate the further advancement of energy blockchain. This survey aims to comprehensively review the fundamental characteristics of blockchain and energy markets, highlighting the significant advantages of combining the two. Moreover, based on existing research outcomes, we will categorize and compare the current energy market research supported by blockchain in terms of algorithm design, market framework construction, and the policies and practical applications adopted by different countries. Finally, we will address current issues and propose potential future directions for improvement, to provide guidance for the practical implementation of blockchain in the energy market. |

Merging distributed computing with cryptographic techniques, decentralized technologies introduce a novel computing paradigm. Blockchain ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data management by validating and recording transactions via consensus across network nodes. Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning framework, enables participants to collaboratively train models while safeguarding data privacy by avoiding direct raw data exchange. Despite the growing interest in decentralized methods, their application in FL remains underexplored. This paper presents a thorough investigation into Blockchain-based FL (BCFL), spotlighting the synergy between blockchain's security features and FL's privacy-preserving model training capabilities. First, we present the taxonomy of BCFL from three aspects, including decentralized, separate networks, and reputation-based architectures. Then, we summarize the general architecture of BCFL systems, providing a comprehensive perspective on FL architectures informed by blockchain. Afterward, we analyze the application of BCFL in healthcare, IoT, and other privacy-sensitive areas. Finally, we identify future research directions of BCFL. |

Indeed, blockchains such as Ethereum have spent considerable resources addressing this issue and have redesigned the block production process to account for MEV. This paper provides an overview of the MEV problem and tracks how Ethereum has adapted to its presence. A vital aspect of the block building exercise is that it is a variant of the knapsack problem. Consequently, this paper highlights the role of designing auctions to fill a knapsack--or knapsack auctions--in alleviating the MEV problem. Overall, this paper presents a survey of the main issues and an accessible primer for researchers and students wishing to explore the economics of block building and MEV further. |
|**2024-03-27**|**Towards Standardized Regulations for Block Chain Smart Contracts: Insights from Delphi and SWARA Analysis**|Shahin Heidari et.al.|[2403.19051](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19051)| The rise of digital currency and the public ledger Block Chain has led to the development of a new type of electronic contract known as "smart contracts." For these contracts to be considered valid, they must adhere to traditional contract rules and be concluded without any impediments. Once written, encrypted, and signed, smart contracts are recorded in the Block Chain Ledger, providing transparent and secure record-keeping. Smart contracts offer several benefits, including their ability to execute automatically without requiring human intervention, their provision of public visibility of contract provisions on the Block Chain, their avoidance of financial crimes like Money Laundering, and their prevention of contract abuses. However, disputes arising from smart contracts still require human intervention, presenting unique challenges in enforcing these contracts, such as evidentiary issues, enforceability of waivers of defenses, and jurisdictional and choice-of-law considerations. Due to the novel nature of smart contracts, there are currently no standardized regulations that apply to them. Countries that have approved them have turned to customary law to legitimize their use. The Delphi method was used to identify critical success factors for applying blockchain transactions in a manufacturing company. Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was then utilized to determine the most influential factors. The proposed methodology was implemented, and results show that the most influential factors for the successful application of blockchain transactions as smart contracts in a manufacturing company are: turnover, the counter argument, vision, components for building, and system outcome quality. Conversely, connections with government entities and subcontractors, and the guarantee of quality have the least influence on successful implementation. |

The widely recognized HotStuff protocol uses cryptographic measures for efficient view changes and reduced communication complexity.

|**2024-03-26**|**Empirical Analysis of EIP-3675: Miner Dynamics, Transaction Fees, and Transaction Time**|Umesh Bhatt et.al.|[2403.17885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17885)| The Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3675 (EIP-3675) marks a significant shift, transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in a staggering 99.95% decrease in energy consumption. However, the transition prompts two critical questions: (1). How does EIP-3675 affect miners' dynamics? and (2). How do users determine priority fees, considering that paying too little may cause delays or non-inclusion, yet paying too much wastes money with little to no benefits? To address the first question, we present a comprehensive empirical study examining EIP-3675's effect on miner dynamics (i.e., miner participation, distribution, and the degree of randomness in miner selection). Our findings reveal that the transition has encouraged broader participation of miners in block append operation, resulting in a larger pool of unique miners ( $\approx50\times$ PoW), and the change in miner distribution with the increased number of unique small category miners ($\approx60\times$ PoW). However, there is an unintended consequence: a reduction in the miner selection randomness, which signifies the negative impact of the transition to PoS-Ethereum on network decentralization. Regarding the second question, we employed regression-based machine learning models; the Gradient Boosting Regressor performed best in predicting priority fees, while the K-Neighbours Regressor was worst. |

Blockchain technology generates considerable amounts of data and has thus been a topic of interest for Machine Learning (ML).   Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art on machine learning applied to blockchain data. This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on ML applied to blockchain data. This will allow us to discover the fields where more effort should be placed in future research.   Method: A systematic mapping study has been conducted to identify the relevant literature. Ultimately, 159 articles were selected and classified according to various dimensions, specifically, the domain use case, the blockchain, the data, and the machine learning models.   Results: The majority of the papers (49.7%) fall within the Anomaly use case. Bitcoin (47.2%) was the blockchain that drew the most attention. A dataset consisting of more than 1.000.000 data points was used by 31.4% of the papers. And Classification (46.5%) was the ML task most applied to blockchain data.   Conclusion: The results confirm that ML applied to blockchain data is a relevant and a growing topic of interest both in the literature and in practice. Nevertheless, some open challenges and gaps remain, which can lead to future research directions. Specifically, we identify novel machine learning algorithms, the lack of a standardization framework, blockchain scalability issues and cross-chain interactions as areas worth exploring in the future. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Towards Secure and Trusted-by-Design Smart Contracts**|Zaynah Dargaye et.al.|[2403.16903](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16903)| Distributed immutable ledgers, or blockchains, allow the secure digitization of evidential transactions without relying on a trusted third-party. Evidential transactions involve the exchange of any form of physical evidence, such as money, birth certificate, visas, tickets, etc. Most of the time, evidential transactions occur in the context of complex procedures, called evidential protocols, among physical agents. The blockchain provides the mechanisms to transfer evidence, while smart contracts - programs executing within the blockchain in a decentralized and replicated fashion - allow encoding evidential protocols on top of a blockchain.   As a smart contract foregoes trusted third-parties and runs on several machines anonymously, it constitutes a highly critical program that has to be secure and trusted-by-design. While most of the current smart contract languages focus on easy programmability, they do not directly address the need of guaranteeing trust and accountability, which becomes a significant issue when evidential protocols are encoded as smart contracts. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Formally Verifying the Safety of Pipelined Moonshot Consensus Protocol**|M. Praveen et.al.|[2403.16637](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16637)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a contemporary competitive as well as complementary to traditional centralized finance systems. As of 23rd January 2024, per Defillama approximately USD 55 billion is the total value locked on the DeFi applications on all blockchains put together.   A Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State Machine Replication (SMR) protocol, popularly known as the consensus protocol, is the central component of a blockchain. If forks are possible in a consensus protocol, they can be misused to carry out double spending attacks and can be catastrophic given high volumes of finance that are transacted on blockchains. Formal verification of the safety of consensus protocols is the golden standard for guaranteeing that forks are not possible. However, it is considered complex and challenging to do. This is reflected by the fact that not many complex consensus protocols are formally verified except for Tendermint and QBFT.   We focus on Supra's Pipelined Moonshot consensus protocol. Similar to Tendermint's formal verification, we too model Pipelined Moonshot using IVy and formally prove that for all network sizes, as long as the number of Byzantine validators is less than one thirds, the protocol does not allow forks, thus proving that Pipelined Moonshot is safe and double spending cannot be done using forks. The IVy model and proof of safety is available on Github. |

Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct). This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM. We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%. The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes. |

This study investigates the impact of 2022 World Cup matches on the dynamic performance of each team's fan token. The event study uncovers fan token returns surged six months before the World Cup, driven by positive anticipation effects. However, intraday analysis reveals a reversal of fan token returns consistently declining and trading volumes rising as matches unfold. To explain findings, we uncover asymmetries whereby defeats in high-stake matches caused a plunge in fan token returns, compared to low-stake matches, intensifying in magnitude for knockout matches. Contrarily, victories enhance trading volumes, reflecting increased market activity without a corresponding positive effect on returns. We align findings with the classic market adage "buy the rumor, sell the news," unveiling cognitive biases and nuances in investor sentiment, cautioning the dichotomy of pre-event optimism and subsequent performance declines. |
|**2024-06-12**|**Single-token vs Two-token Blockchain Tokenomics**|Aggelos Kiayias et.al.|[2403.15429](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15429)| We consider long-term equilibria that arise in the tokenomics design of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems that comprise of users and validators, both striving to maximize their own utilities. Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired portion of the system service.   We study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged, (2) decentralization: multiple validators are participating, (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, i.e., it does not require fiat reserves on-chain for buy back of tokens or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings. Our analysis enables to put forward a novel generic mechanism for blockchain ``monetary policy'' that we call {\em quantitative rewarding} (QR). We investigate how to implement QR in single-token and two-token proof of stake (PoS) blockchain systems. The latter are systems that utilize one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded. Our approach demonstrates a concrete advantage of the two-token setting in terms of the ability of the QR mechanism to be realized effectively and provide good equilibria. Our analysis also reveals an inherent limitation of the single token setting in terms of implementing an effective blockchain monetary policy - a distinction that is, to the best of our knowledge, highlighted for the first time. |
|**2024-03-22**|**Blockchain-based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse**|Jiawen Kang et.al.|[2403.15285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15285)| Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs), the Vehicle Twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses. |

This article explores the Metaverse from the perspective of multimedia communication by conducting and analyzing real-world experiments on four different Metaverse platforms: VR (virtual reality) Vircadia, VR Mozilla Hubs, VRChat, and MR (mixed reality) Virtual City. We first investigate the traffic patterns and network performance in the three VR platforms. After raising the challenges of the Metaverse streaming and investigating the potential methods to enhance Metaverse performance, we propose a remote rendering architecture and verify its advantages through a prototype involving the campus network and MR multimodal interaction by comparison with local rendering. |

A growing number of application domains, such as healthcare, utilize these statistics in advancing research and improving patient care.   In this work, we explore the challenge of input validation and public verifiability within privacy-preserving aggregation protocols. We address the scenario in which a party receives data from multiple sources and must verify the validity of the input and correctness of the computations over this data to third parties, such as auditors, while ensuring input data privacy. To achieve this, we propose the "VPAS" protocol, which satisfies these requirements. Our protocol utilizes homomorphic encryption for data privacy, and employs Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and a blockchain system for input validation and public verifiability. We constructed VPAS by extending existing verifiable encryption schemes into secure protocols that enable N clients to encrypt, aggregate, and subsequently release the final result to a collector in a verifiable manner.   We implemented and experimentally evaluated VPAS with regard to encryption costs, proof generation, and verification. The findings indicate that the overhead associated with verifiability in our protocol is 10x lower than that incurred by simply using conventional zkSNARKs. This enhanced efficiency makes it feasible to apply input validation with public verifiability across a wider range of applications or use cases that can tolerate moderate computational overhead associated with proof generation. |

The rise of Bitcoin and other crypto assets based on Distributed Ledger Technology mark a fundamental change in the way people transact and transmit value over a decentralized network, spread across geographies. This has created regulatory and tax policy blind spots, as governments and tax administrations take time to understand and provide policy responses to this innovative, revolutionary, and fast-paced technology. Due to the breakneck speed of innovation in blockchain technology and advent of Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Metaverse, it is unlikely that the policy interventions and guidance by regulatory authorities or tax administrations would be ahead or in sync with the pace of innovation. This paper tries to explain the principles on which crypto assets function, their underlying technology and relates them to the tax issues and taxable events which arise within this ecosystem. It also provides instances of tax and regulatory policy responses already in effect in various jurisdictions, including the recent changes in reporting standards by the FATF and the OECD. This paper tries to explain the rationale behind existing laws and policies and the challenges in their implementation. It also attempts to present a ballpark estimate of tax potential of this asset class and suggests creation of global public digital infrastructure that can address issues related to pseudonymity and extra-territoriality. The paper analyses both direct and indirect taxation issues related to crypto assets and discusses more recent aspects like proof-of-stake and maximal extractable value in greater detail. |
|**2024-06-07**|**Tie-Breaking Rule Based on Partial Proof of Work in a Blockchain**|Akira Sakurai et.al.|[2403.15030](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15030)| In the area of blockchain, numerous methods have been proposed for suppressing intentional forks by attackers more effectively than the random rule. However, all of them, except for the random rule, require major updates, rely on a trusted third party, or assume strong synchrony. Hence, it is challenging to apply these methods to existing systems such as Bitcoin.   To address these issues, we propose another countermeasure that can be easily applied to existing proof of work blockchain systems. Our method is a tie-breaking rule that uses partial proof of work, which does not function as a block, as a time standard with finer granularity. By using the characteristic of partial proof of work, the proposed method enables miners to choose the last-generated block in a chain tie, which suppresses intentional forks by attackers. Only weak synchrony, which is already met by existing systems such as Bitcoin, is required for effective functioning.   We evaluated the proposed method through a detailed analysis that is lacking in existing works. In networks that adopt our method, the proportion of the attacker hashrate necessary for selfish mining was approximately 0.31479 or higher, regardless of the block propagation capability of the attacker. Furthermore, we demonstrated through extended selfish mining that the impact of Match against pre-generated block, which is a concern in all last-generated rules, can be mitigated with appropriate parameter settings. |

|**2024-04-03**|**Global, robust and comparable digital carbon assets**|Sadiq Jaffer et.al.|[2403.14581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14581)| Carbon credits purchased in the voluntary carbon market allow unavoidable emissions, such as from international flights for essential travel, to be offset by an equivalent climate benefit, such as avoiding emissions from tropical deforestation. However, many concerns regarding the credibility of these offsetting claims have been raised. Moreover, the credit market is manual, therefore inefficient and unscalable, and non-fungible, therefore illiquid. To address these issues, we propose an efficient digital methodology that combines remote sensing data, modern econometric techniques, and on-chain certification and trading to create a new digital carbon asset (the PACT stablecoin) against which carbon offsetting claims can be transparently verified. PACT stablecoins are produced as outputs from a reproducible computational pipeline for estimating the climate benefits of carbon offset projects that not only quantifies the CO2 emissions involved, but also allows for similar credits to be pooled based on their co-benefits such as biodiversity and jurisdictional attributes, increasing liquidity through fungibility within pools. We implement and evaluate the PACT carbon stablecoin on the Tezos blockchain, which is designed to facilitate low-cost transactions while minimizing environmental impact. Our implementation includes a contract for a registry for tracking issuance, ownership, and retirement of credits, and a custodian contract to bridge on-chain and off-chain transactions. Our work brings scale and trust to the voluntary carbon market by providing a transparent, scalable, and efficient framework for high integrity carbon credit transactions. |

Building upon concepts such as adversarial assumptions, goals, and capabilities, our proposed adversary model classifies and constrains the use of adversarial actions based on classical distributed system models, defined by both failure and communication models. The objective is to study the effects of these allowed actions on the properties of distributed protocols under various system models. A significant aspect of our research involves integrating this adversary model into the Multi-Agent eXperimenter (MAX) framework. This integration enables fine-grained simulations of adversarial attacks on blockchain networks. In this paper, we particularly study four distinct fairness properties on Hyperledger Fabric with the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Tendermint consensus algorithm being selected for its ordering service. We define novel attacks that combine adversarial actions on both protocols, with the aim of violating a specific client-fairness property. Simulations confirm our ability to violate this property and allow us to evaluate the impact of these attacks on several order-fairness properties that relate orders of transaction reception and delivery. |

Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS).   Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns. Our thorough review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks of tasks on LLM4BS, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. |
|**2024-03-20**|**Statistical Confidence in Mining Power Estimates for PoW Blockchains**|Mary Milad et.al.|[2403.13736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13736)| The security of blockchain systems depends on the distribution of mining power across participants. If sufficient mining power is controlled by one entity, they can force their own version of events. This may allow them to double spend coins, for example. For Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, however, the distribution of mining power cannot be read directly from the blockchain and must instead be inferred from the number of blocks mined in a specific sample window. We introduce a framework to quantify this statistical uncertainty for the Nakamoto coefficient, which is a commonly-used measure of blockchain decentralization. We show that aggregating blocks over a day can lead to considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin failing more than half the hypothesis tests ({\alpha} = 0.05) when using a daily granularity. For these reasons, we recommend that blocks are aggregated over a sample window of at least 7 days. Instead of reporting a single value, our approach produces a range of possible Nakamoto coefficient values that have statistical support at a particular significance level {\alpha}. |

Inthis work, we propose a specification mining approach to infer contract specifications from past transactionhistories. Our approach derives high-level behavioral automata of function invocations, accompanied byprogram invariants statistically inferred from the transaction histories. We implemented our approach as toolSmConand evaluated it on eleven well-studied Azure benchmark smart contracts and six popular real-worldDApp smart contracts. The experiments show thatSmConmines reasonably accurate specifications that canbe used to facilitate DApp understanding and development in terms of document maintenance and test suite improvement. |

Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of block to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing mechanisms. |

Incorporating the promising sixth-generation (6G) technology with large bandwidth and space-air-ground integrated coverage, 6G-based Web 3.0 holds great potential in empowering users with enhanced data control and facilitating secure peer-to-peer transactions, especially in consumer electronics, through the utilization of blockchain technologies. However, 6G-based Web 3.0 is still in its infancy, such as ensuring block freshness and optimizing block propagation to improve blockchain performance. In this paper, we develop a freshness-aware block propagation optimization framework for 6G-based Web 3.0. We first propose a novel metric called Age of Block Information (AoBI) based on the concept of age of information to quantify block freshness. To make block propagation optimization tractable, we classify miners into five different states and propose a block propagation model for public blockchains inspired by epidemic models. Moreover, considering that the miners are bounded rational, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game for block propagation to improve block propagation efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with other block propagation mechanisms, the proposed scheme has a higher block forwarding probability, which improves block propagation efficiency. |

However, this growth has also led to a largely unexplored aspect: their security vulnerabilities. As the ecosystem that includes both offline and online models, various tools, browser plugins, and third-party applications continues to expand, it significantly widens the attack surface, thereby escalating the potential for security breaches. These expansions in the 6G and beyond landscape provide new avenues for adversaries to manipulate LLMs for malicious purposes. We focus on the security aspects of LLMs from the viewpoint of potential adversaries. We aim to dissect their objectives and methodologies, providing an in-depth analysis of known security weaknesses. This will include the development of a comprehensive threat taxonomy, categorizing various adversary behaviors. Also, our research will concentrate on how LLMs can be integrated into cybersecurity efforts by defense teams, also known as blue teams. We will explore the potential synergy between LLMs and blockchain technology, and how this combination could lead to the development of next-generation, fully autonomous security solutions. This approach aims to establish a unified cybersecurity strategy across the entire computing continuum, enhancing overall digital security infrastructure. |

In the DAO, no single entity can arbitrarily control the dApps without approval from the majority of members. However, despite its advantages, DAO has also been targeted by several attacks, leading to the loss of millions of dollars. In this paper, we first provided an overview of the DAO governance process within the blockchain. Next, we identified the issues within three components of governance process: Governance Contract, Documentation, and Proposal. Each of these components is vulnerable to issues that could potentially result in substantial financial losses. Then we developed automated methods to detected above issues. To investigate the issues within the existing DAO ecosystem, we constructed a state-of-the-art dataset that includes 16,427 DAOs, 183 documentation, and 122,307 proposals across 9 different blockchains. Our analysis reveals that a majority of DAO developers and members have not given sufficient attention to these issues, especially in the area of proposal. The result shows that over 60% of the examined proposals fail to provide a consistent description and code for their members, highlighting a significant gap in ensuring transparency within the DAO governance process. For a better DAO governance ecosystem, DAO developers and members can utilize the methods to identify and address issues within governance process. |

It is known for its efficiency and is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Tangle can be configured by utilizing the tip selection process. Due to performance issues with light nodes, full nodes are being asked to perform the tip selections of light nodes. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that tip selection can be exploited to compromise users' privacy. An adversary full node can associate a transaction with the identity of a light node by comparing the light node's request with its ledger. We show that these types of attacks are not only viable in the current IOTA environment but also in IOTA 2.0 and the privacy improvement being studied. We also provide solutions to mitigate these attacks and propose ways to enhance anonymity in the IOTA network while maintaining efficiency and scalability. |

Although Solana has only begun to gain popularity in recent years, its NFT market has seen substantial transaction volumes. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic research on the characteristics of Solana NFTs from two perspectives: longitudinal measurement and wash trading security audit. We gathered 132,736 Solana NFT from Solscan and analyzed the sales data within these collections. Investigating users' economic activity and NFT owner information reveals that the top users in Solana NFT are skewed toward a higher distribution of purchases. Subsequently, we employ the Local Outlier Factor algorithm to conduct a wash trading audit on 2,175 popular Solana NFTs. We discovered that 138 NFT pools are involved in wash trading, with 8 of these NFTs having a wash trading rate exceeding 50%. Fortunately, none of these NFTs have been entirely washed out. |

LSTs are tokenized representations of staked assets on proof-of-stake blockchains. First, we theoretically model LST-liquidity on AMMs. This includes categorizing suitable AMM types for LST liquidity, as well as deriving formulas for the necessary returns from trading fees to adequately compensate liquidity providers under the particular price trajectories of LSTs. Two relevant metrics are considered. Firstly, losses compared to holding the liquidity outside the AMM (loss-versus-holding, or impermanent loss). Secondly, the relative profitability compared to fully staking the capital (loss-versus-staking) which is a metric specifically introduced for the case of LST-liquidity. Subsequently, we empirically measure these metrics for Ethereum LSTs across the most relevant AMM pools. We find that, while trading fees often compensate for impermanent loss, fully staking is more profitable for many pools, putting the sustainability of current LST allocation to AMMs into question. |

However, the excessive installation and lack of recycling facilities pose environmental risks. This paper suggests a circular economy approach to address the issue. By implementing blockchain technology, the end-of-life (EOL) of solar panels can be tracked, and responsibilities can be assigned to relevant stakeholders. The degradation of panels can be monetized by tracking users' energy-related activities, and these funds can be used for future recycling.

There, every contract step corresponds to appending to the blockchain a new transaction that spends the output representing the old contract state, creating a new one for the updated state. This standard procedure requires the contract participants to pay transaction fees for every execution step. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that moves most of the execution of a Bitcoin contract off-chain. When all participants follow this protocol, they are able to save on transaction fees. By contrast, in the presence of adversaries, any honest participant is still able to enforce the correct execution of the contract, according to its original semantics. |

Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios. |
|**2024-05-17**|**Efficient Signature-Free Validated Agreement**|Pierre Civit et.al.|[2403.08374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08374)| Byzantine agreement enables n processes to agree on a common L-bit value, despite up to t > 0 arbitrary failures. A long line of work has been dedicated to improving the bit complexity of Byzantine agreement in synchrony. This has culminated in COOL, an error-free (deterministically secure against a computationally unbounded adversary) solution that achieves O(nL + n^2 logn) worst-case bit complexity (which is optimal for L > n logn according to the Dolev-Reischuk lower bound). COOL satisfies strong validity: if all correct processes propose the same value, only that value can be decided.   Strong validity is, however, not appropriate for today's state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain protocols. These systems value progress and require a decided value to always be valid, excluding default decisions (such as EMPTY) even in cases where there is no unanimity a priori. Validated Byzantine agreement satisfies this property (called external validity). Yet, the best error-free (or even signature-free) validated agreement solutions achieve only O(n^2L) bit complexity, a far cry from the Omega(nL + n^2) Dolev-Reishcuk lower bound. In this paper, we present two new synchronous algorithms for validated Byzantine agreement, HashExt and ErrorFreeExt, with different trade-offs. Both algorithms are (1) signature-free, (2) optimally resilient (tolerate up to t < n / 3 failures), and (3) early-stopping (terminate in O(f+1) rounds, where f <= t is the actual number of failures). On the one hand, HashExt uses only hashes and achieves O(nL + n^3 kappa) bit complexity, which is optimal for L > n^2 kappa (where kappa is the size of a hash). On the other hand, ErrorFreeExt is error-free, using no cryptography whatsoever, and achieves O( (nL + n^2) logn ) bit complexity, which is near-optimal for any L. |

However, to be considered masterpieces, they must be maintained in pristine condition or restored according to strict guidelines applied by expert services. Therefore, all data about restoration processes and other relevant information about these vehicles must be rigorously documented to ensure their verifiability and immutability. Here, we report on our ongoing research to adequately provide such capabilities to the classic car ecosystem.   Using a design science research approach, we have developed a blockchain-based solution using Hyperledger Fabric that facilitates the proper recording of classic car information, restoration procedures applied, and all related documentation by ensuring that this data is immutable and trustworthy while promoting collaboration between interested parties. This solution was validated and received positive feedback from various entities in the classic car sector. The enhanced and secured documentation is expected to contribute to the digital transformation of the classic car sector, promote authenticity and trustworthiness, and ultimately increase the market value of classic cars. |

An electronic healthcare system that checks patient data, prepares medicines and provides financial assistance is necessary. Providing safe data transmission, monitoring, decentralization, preserving patient privacy, and maintaining confidentiality are essential to an electronic healthcare system. In this study, we introduce (SCALHEALTH) which is a blockchain-based scheme of the Hyperledger Fabric consortium. In this study, we use authentication to agree on a common key for data encryption to send data confidentially. Also, sending data through IPFS is decentralized. Non-fungible token (NFT) is used to send patient prescriptions to pharmacies and insurance companies to ensure the authenticity of patient prescriptions. As the system's main body, blockchain creates authorization and validation for all devices and institutions. Also, all metadata in the system is recorded on the blockchain to maintain integrity, transparency, and timely data monitoring. The proposed study uses two types of blockchain: a health blockchain and a financial blockchain. The financial blockchain is for financial transactions and is based on Ethereum. The health blockchain also introduces a mechanism that allows several blockchains to be active in parallel, instead of only one blockchain. The prototype of this mechanism is simulated in two scenarios. In comparison to the normal state, the proposed plan has superior results. |

The Blockchain network validates such transactions, storing them into sequential blocks of which integrity is ensured. Smart Contracts deal with value stakes, if a damaging transaction is validated, it may never be reverted, leading to unrecoverable losses. To prevent this, security aspects have been explored in several fields, with research providing catalogs of security defects, secure code recommendations, and possible solutions to fix vulnerabilities. In our study, we refer to vulnerability fixing in the ways found in the literature as guidelines. However, it is not clear to what extent developers adhere to these guidelines, nor whether there are other viable common solutions and what they are. The goal of our research is to fill knowledge gaps related to developers' observance of existing guidelines and to propose new and viable solutions to security vulnerabilities. To reach our goal, we will obtain from Solidity GitHub repositories the commits that fix vulnerabilities included in the DASP TOP 10 and we will conduct a manual analysis of fixing approaches employed by developers. Our analysis aims to determine the extent to which literature-based fixing strategies are followed. Additionally, we will identify and discuss emerging fixing techniques not currently documented in the literature. Through qualitative analysis, we will evaluate the suitability of these new fixing solutions and discriminate between valid approaches and potential mistakes. |

Today, there are multiple blockchains with differing interfaces and security properties. Programming in this multi-blockchain world is hindered by the lack of general and convenient abstractions for cross-chain communication and computation. Current cross-chain communication bridges have varied and low-level interfaces, making it difficult to develop portable applications. Current methods for multi-chain atomic transactions are limited in scope to cryptocurrency swaps.   This work addresses these issues. We first define a uniform, high-level interface for communication between chains. Building on this interface, we formulate a protocol that guarantees atomicity for general transactions whose operations may span several chains. We formulate and prove the desired correctness and security properties of these protocols. Our prototype implementation is built using the LayerZero cross-chain bridge. Experience with this implementation shows that the new abstractions considerably simplify the design and implementation of multi-chain transactions. Experimental evaluation with multi-chain swap transactions demonstrates performance comparable to that of custom-built implementations. |

With its inherent benefits of decentralization and anonymization, blockchain has gained considerable attention in developing covert channels. To guarantee a highly secure covert channel, channel negotiation should be contactless before the communication, carrier transaction features must be indistinguishable from normal transactions during the communication, and communication identities must be untraceable after the communication. Such a full-lifecycle covert channel is indispensable to defend against a versatile adversary who intercepts two communicating parties comprehensively (e.g., on-chain and off-chain). Unfortunately, it has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. We make the first effort to achieve a full-lifecycle covert channel, a novel blockchain-based covert channel named ABC-Channel. We tackle a series of challenges, such as off-chain contact dependency, increased masquerading difficulties as growing transaction volume, and time-evolving, communicable yet untraceable identities, to achieve contactless channel negotiation, indistinguishable transaction features, and untraceable communication identities, respectively. We develop a working prototype to validate ABC-Channel and conduct extensive tests on the Bitcoin testnet. The experimental results demonstrate that ABC-Channel achieves substantially secure covert capabilities. In comparison to existing methods, it also exhibits state-of-the-art transmission efficiency. |

However, to advance AI R&D, two challenges arise: 1) significant data imbalance, with most data from Europe/America and under 10% from Asia, despite its 60% global population share; and 2) hefty time and investment needed to curate proprietary datasets for commercial use. In response, we established the first commercial medical imaging platform, encompassing steps like: 1) data collection, 2) data selection, 3) annotation, and 4) pre-processing. Moreover, we focus on harnessing under-represented data from Japan and broader Asia, including Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Whole Slide Imaging scans. Using the collected data, we are preparing/providing ready-to-use datasets for medical AI R&D by 1) offering these datasets to AI firms, biopharma, and medical device makers and 2) using them as training/test data to develop tailored AI solutions for such entities. We also aim to merge Blockchain for data security and plan to synthesize rare disease data via generative AI. DataHub Website: https://medical-datahub.ai/ |

Nazari et.al.|[2403.06112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06112)| This paper introduces peer to peer (P2P) trading mechanisms based on decentralized Blockchain to facilitate retail electricity market for ever-increasing distributed energy resources (DERs). The Blockchain network supports fast and secure retail trading among DERs and facilitates a sustainable local P2P trading platform. In this decentralized Blockchain architecture no single entity or organization has control over the entire system rather all users collectively maintain control. The effectiveness of the proposed automated market design and optimization is simulated using different use case scenarios in an open source Blockchain Simulator and MATLAB. The results show the efficacy of the trading mechanism in achieving demand response through strategies such as peak load shaving, load shifting, and integration of DERs. |

This paper presents "SecureRights," an innovative Blockchain-based Trusted Digital Rights Management (DRM) framework. It strengthens the defence against unauthorized use and streamlines the claim of digital rights. Utilizing blockchain, digital watermarking, perceptual hashing, Quick Response (QR) codes, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), SecureRights securely stores watermark information on the blockchain with timestamp authentication. Incorporating perceptual hashing generates robust hash tokens based on image structure. The addition of QR codes enhances the watermarking, offering a comprehensive solution for resilient intellectual property rights protection. Rigorous evaluations affirm SecureRights' resilience against various attacks, establishing its efficacy in safeguarding digital content and simplifying rightful ownership assertion. |

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) looks promising for enhancing performance and reducing costs by offloading the computing work of IoT to MEC servers. However, the current methods for offloading have issues with privacy and security during the transfer of data and programs. To tackle this, recent developments have introduced secure offloading methods using Blockchain technology, which helps to make MEC more secure by building trust between nodes, improving how edges are authenticated and accessed, and stopping unauthorized access to devices. This paper reviews these Blockchain-based offloading methods for different MEC settings. It starts by explaining the key ideas in offloading and Blockchain, then it sorts the Blockchain-based offloading methods by the algorithms they use. It also compares the offloading methods in each group and ends with a discussion and comparison of the different techniques, tools, and metrics used in these methods. |

Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs. |

We propose a simplified consensus-based verification process integrated with an adaptive thresholding mechanism. This dynamic thresholding is designed to adjust based on the evolving landscape of model updates, offering a refined layer of anomaly detection that aligns with the real-time needs of distributed learning environments. Our method necessitates a majority consensus among participating clients to validate updates, ensuring that only vetted and consensual modifications are applied to the global model. The efficacy of our approach is validated through experiments on two benchmark datasets in deep learning, CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Our results indicate a significant mitigation of label-flipping attacks, bolstering the FL system's resilience. This method transcends conventional techniques that depend on anomaly detection or statistical validation by incorporating a verification layer reminiscent of blockchain's participatory validation without the associated cryptographic overhead. The innovation of our approach rests in striking an optimal balance between heightened security measures and the inherent limitations of FL systems, such as computational efficiency and data privacy. Implementing a consensus mechanism specifically tailored for FL environments paves the way for more secure, robust, and trustworthy distributed machine learning applications, where safeguarding data integrity and model robustness is critical. |

However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms. |

We assume that a Smart Contract is associated with each transaction and that the Smart Contract is responsible for providing automatic feedback, replacing notoriously unreliable buyer feedback by a more objective assessment of how well the parties have fulfilled their obligations. Our trust and reputation service was inspired by Laplace Law of Succession, where trust in a seller is defined as the probability that she will fulfill her obligations on the next transaction. We offer three applications. First, we discuss an application to a multi-segment marketplace, where a malicious seller may establish a stellar reputation by selling cheap items, only to use their excellent reputation to defraud buyers in a different market segment. Next, we demonstrate how our trust and reputation service works in the context of sellers with time-varying performance by providing two discounting schemes wherein older reputation scores are given less weight than more recent ones. Finally, we show how to predict trust and reputation far in the future, based on incomplete information. Extensive simulations have confirmed our analytical results. |

Decentralized solutions like distributed ledgers, particularly blockchain, are crucial for eliminating single points of failure. However, the existing literature on blockchain-based collaborative cybersecurity is limited, lacking comprehensive insights. This paper addresses this gap by surveying blockchain's role in collaborative cybersecurity from 2016 to 2023. It explores various applications, trends, and the evolution of blockchain technology, focusing on access control, data validation policies, underlying tech, and consensus mechanisms. A key finding is the fragmentation of the field with no dominant research group or venue. Many recent projects poorly select consensus protocols for their blockchain. To aid researchers and practitioners, this paper offers guidelines for choosing the right blockchain for specific purposes and highlights open research areas and lessons learned from past blockchain applications in collaborative cybersecurity, encouraging further exploration in this field. |
|**2024-03-14**|**On HTLC-Based Protocols for Multi-Party Cross-Chain Swaps**|Emily Clark et.al.|[2403.03906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03906)| In his 2018 paper, Herlihy introduced an atomic protocol for multi-party asset swaps across different blockchains. His model represents an asset swap by a directed graph whose nodes are the participating parties and edges represent asset transfers, and rational behavior of the participants is captured by a preference relation between a protocol's outcomes. Asset transfers between parties are achieved using smart contracts. These smart contracts are quite involved and they require storage and processing of a large number of paths in the swap digraph, limiting practical significance of his protocol. His paper also describes a different protocol that uses only standard hash time-lock contracts (HTLC's), but this simpler protocol applies only to some special types of digraphs. He left open the question whether there is a simple and efficient protocol for cross-chain asset swaps in arbitrary digraphs. Motivated by this open problem, we conducted a comprehensive study of \emph{HTLC-based protocols}, in which all asset transfers are implemented with HTLCs. Our main contribution is a full characterization of swap digraphs that have such protocols. |

This is essential to ensure that the momentum of this trend translates into tangible outcomes, thwarting phenomena like greenwashing and upholding high standards of integrity, all while expediting progress through automation. This paper focuses specifically on carbon markets, which, after enduring years of confusion and controversy, may finally be on the brink of converging toward internationally recognized minimum standards. Beginning with an introduction to fundamental concepts pertaining to carbon markets and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), the paper proceeds to dissect the challenges and opportunities within this burgeoning field. Its primary contribution lies in offering a comprehensive overview of recent developments across various initiatives (such as ICVCM, IETA/WorldBank/CAD Trust, IEEE/ISO) and providing a layered analysis of the entire ecosystem. This framework aids in understanding and prioritising future endeavours. Ultimately, the paper furnishes a set of recommendations aimed at bolstering scalability and fostering widespread adoption of best practices within international markets. |

As an introduced new transaction type, cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of a generic sharding consensus pattern that achieves both security and low overhead. In this paper, we present Kronos, a secure sharding blockchain consensus achieving optimized overhead. In particular, we propose a new secure sharding consensus pattern, based on a buffer managed jointly by shard members. Valid transactions are transferred to the payee via the buffer, while invalid ones are rejected through happy or unhappy paths. Kronos is proved to achieve security with atomicity under malicious clients with optimal intra-shard overhead $kB$ ($k$ for involved shard number and $B$ for a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) cost). Besides, we propose secure cross-shard certification methods based on batch certification and reliable cross-shard transfer. The former combines hybrid trees or vector commitments, while the latter integrates erasure coding. Handling $b$ transactions, Kronos is proved to achieve reliability with low cross-shard overhead $O(n b \lambda)$ ($n$ for shard size and $\lambda$ for the security parameter). Notably, Kronos imposes no restrictions on BFT and does not rely on time assumptions, offering optional constructions in various modules. We implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: asynchronous Speeding Dumbo and partial synchronous Hotstuff. Extensive experiments demonstrate Kronos scales the consensus nodes to thousands, achieving a substantial throughput of 320 ktx/sec with 2.0 sec latency. Compared with the past solutions, Kronos outperforms, achieving up to a 12* improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency. |

This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM. |

|**2024-03-06**|**An Analysis of Intent-Based Markets**|Tarun Chitra et.al.|[2403.02525](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02525)| Mechanisms for decentralized finance on blockchains suffer from various problems, including suboptimal price execution for users, latency, and a worse user experience compared to their centralized counterparts. Recently, off-chain marketplaces, colloquially called `intent markets,' have been proposed as a solution to these problems. In these markets, agents called \emph{solvers} compete to satisfy user orders, which may include complicated user-specified conditions. We provide two formal models of solvers' strategic behavior: one probabilistic and another deterministic. In our first model, solvers initially pay upfront costs to enter a Dutch auction to fill the user's order and then exert congestive, costly effort to search for prices for the user. Our results show that the costs incurred by solvers result in restricted entry in the market. Further, in the presence of costly effort and congestion, our results counter-intuitively show that a planner who aims to maximize user welfare may actually prefer to restrict entry, resulting in limited oligopoly. We then introduce an alternative, optimization-based deterministic model which corroborates these results. We conclude with extensions of our model to other auctions within blockchains and non-cryptocurrency applications, such as the US SEC's Proposal 615. |

Unlike previous studies focusing on the binary relationship between a paper and the concept it attributes to technology, our approach utilizes attribution scores to enhance the relationships between research papers, combining keywords, citation rates, and collaboration status with specific technological concepts. The proposed method integrates text mining and bibliometric analyses to formulate and predict technological proximity indices for encryption technologies using the "OpenAlex" catalog. Our case study findings highlight a significant convergence between blockchain and public-key cryptography, evidenced by the increasing proximity indices. These results offer valuable strategic insights for those contemplating investments in these domains. |

As of March 2023, the estimated global cryptocurrency market cap has reached approximately $949 billion. However, security incidents continue to plague the DeFi ecosystem, and one of the most notorious examples is the ``Rug Pull" scam. This type of cryptocurrency scam occurs when the developer of a particular token project intentionally abandons the project and disappears with investors' funds. Despite it only emerging in recent years, Rug Pull events have already caused significant financial losses. In this work, we manually collected and analyzed 103 real-world rug pull events, categorizing them based on their scam methods. Two primary categories were identified: Contract-related Rug Pull (through malicious functions in smart contracts) and Transaction-related Rug Pull (through cryptocurrency trading without utilizing malicious functions). Based on the analysis of rug pull events, we propose CRPWarner (short for Contract-related Rug Pull Risk Warner) to identify malicious functions in smart contracts and issue warnings regarding potential rug pulls. We evaluated CRPWarner on 69 open-source smart contracts related to rug pull events and achieved a 91.8% precision, 85.9% recall and 88.7% F1-score. Additionally, when evaluating CRPWarner on 13,484 real token contracts on Ethereum, it successfully detected 4168 smart contracts with malicious functions, including zero-day examples. The precision of large-scale experiment reach 84.9%. |

While effective at preserving privacy, FL systems face limitations such as single points of failure, lack of incentives, and inadequate security. To address these challenges, blockchain technology is integrated into FL systems to provide stronger security, fairness, and scalability. However, blockchain-empowered FL (BC-FL) systems introduce additional demands on network, computing, and storage resources. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research on BC-FL systems, analyzing the benefits and challenges associated with blockchain integration. We explore why blockchain is applicable to FL, how it can be implemented, and the challenges and existing solutions for its integration. Additionally, we offer insights on future research directions for the BC-FL system. |
|**2024-03-01**|**Assessing the Efficacy of Heuristic-Based Address Clustering for Bitcoin**|Hugo Schnoering et.al.|[2403.00523](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00523)| Exploring transactions within the Bitcoin blockchain entails examining the transfer of bitcoins among several hundred million entities. However, it is often impractical and resource-consuming to study such a vast number of entities. Consequently, entity clustering serves as an initial step in most analytical studies. This process often employs heuristics grounded in the practices and behaviors of these entities. In this research, we delve into the examination of two widely used heuristics, alongside the introduction of four novel ones. Our contribution includes the introduction of the \textit{clustering ratio}, a metric designed to quantify the reduction in the number of entities achieved by a given heuristic. The assessment of this reduction ratio plays an important role in justifying the selection of a specific heuristic for analytical purposes. Given the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin system, characterized by a continuous increase in the number of entities on the blockchain, and the evolving behaviors of these entities, we extend our study to explore the temporal evolution of the clustering ratio for each heuristic. This temporal analysis enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of these heuristics over time. |

This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by proposing the adaptive restructuring of Merkle and Verkle trees, fundamental components of blockchain architecture responsible for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient verification processes. Unlike traditional static tree structures, our adaptive model dynamically adjusts the configuration of these trees based on usage patterns, significantly reducing the average path length required for verification and, consequently, the computational overhead associated with these processes. Through a comprehensive conceptual framework, we delineate the methodology for adaptive restructuring, encompassing both binary and non-binary tree configurations. This framework is validated through a series of detailed examples, demonstrating the practical feasibility and the efficiency gains achievable with our approach. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis with existing scalability solutions, highlighting the unique advantages of adaptive restructuring in terms of simplicity, security, and efficiency enhancement without introducing additional complexities or dependencies. This study's implications extend beyond theoretical advancements, offering a scalable, secure, and efficient method for blockchain data verification that could facilitate broader adoption of blockchain technology in finance, supply chain management, and beyond. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, the principles and methodologies outlined herein are poised to contribute significantly to its growth and maturity. |

In contrast to the underlying blockchains, the bridges often provide inferior security guarantees and have been targets of hacks causing damage in the range of 1.5 to 2 billion USD in 2022. The current state of bridge architectures is that they are ambiguous, and there is next to no notion of how different architectures and their components are related to different vulnerabilities. Throughout this study, we have analysed 60 different bridges and 34 bridge exploits in the last three years (2021-2023). Our analyses identified 13 architectural components of the bridges. We linked the components to eight types of vulnerabilities, also called design flaws. We identified prevention measures and proposed 11 impact reduction measures based on the existing and possible countermeasures to address the imminent exploits of the design flaws. The results are meant to be used as guidelines for designing and implementing secure cross-chain bridge architectures, preventing design flaws, and mitigating the negative impacts of exploits. |

However, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the requirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce differential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly deteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based Decentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic encryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly aggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to get rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new concept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model performance. Moreover, the proposed AerisAI also provides the broadcast-aware group key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level agreements. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed AerisAI as well as the functionality comparison with the other baselines. We also conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that our proposed AerisAI significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art baselines. |

The innovation in crypto space is often compared to the impact internet had on human life. There is a new term called Web 3.0 for denoting all new computing innovations arising due to the blockchain technologies. Blockchain has emerged as one of the most important inventions of the last decade with crypto currencies or financial use case as one of the domains which progressed most in the last 10 years. It is very important to research about Web 3 technologies, how it is connected to crypto economy and what to expect in this field for the next several decades. |
|**2024-03-05**|**An Empirical Analysis of Scam Tokens on Ethereum Blockchain**|Vahidin Jeleskovic et.al.|[2402.19399](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19399)| This article presents an empirical investigation into the determinants of total revenue generated by counterfeit tokens on Uniswap. It offers a detailed overview of the counterfeit token fraud process, along with a systematic summary of characteristics associated with such fraudulent activities observed in Uniswap. The study primarily examines the relationship between revenue from counterfeit token scams and their defining characteristics, and analyzes the influence of market economic factors such as return on market capitalization and price return on Ethereum. Key findings include a significant increase in overall transactions of counterfeit tokens on their first day of fraud, and a rise in upfront fraud costs leading to corresponding increases in revenue. Furthermore, a negative correlation is identified between the total revenue of counterfeit tokens and the volatility of Ethereum market capitalization return, while price return volatility on Ethereum is found to have a positive impact on counterfeit token revenue, albeit requiring further investigation for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the number of subscribers for the real token correlates positively with the realized volume of scam tokens, indicating that a larger community following the legitimate token may inadvertently contribute to the visibility and success of counterfeit tokens. Conversely, the number of Telegram subscribers exhibits a negative impact on the realized volume of scam tokens, suggesting that a higher level of scrutiny or awareness within Telegram communities may act as a deterrent to fraudulent activities. Finally, the timing of when the scam token is introduced on the Ethereum blockchain may have a negative impact on its success. Notably, the cumulative amount scammed by only 42 counterfeit tokens amounted to almost 11214 Ether. |
|**2024-03-19**|**Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability: Applications to prophet inequalities & transaction fee mechanism design**|Aadityan Ganesh et.al.|[2402.19292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292)| This paper studies the fundamental limits of availability and throughput for independent and heterogeneous demands of a limited resource. Availability is the probability that the demands are below the capacity of the resource. Throughput is the expected fraction of the resource that is utilized by the demands. We offer a concentration inequality generator that gives lower bounds on feasible availability and throughput pairs with a given capacity and independent but not necessarily identical distributions of up-to-unit demands. We show that availability and throughput cannot both be poor. These bounds are analogous to tail inequalities on sums of independent random variables, but hold throughout the support of the demand distribution. This analysis gives analytically tractable bounds supporting the unit-demand characterization of Chawla, Devanur, and Lykouris (2023) and generalizes to up-to-unit demands. Our bounds also provide an approach towards improved multi-unit prophet inequalities (Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, and Sandholm, 2007). They have applications to transaction fee mechanism design (for blockchains) where high availability limits the probability of profitable user-miner coalitions (Chung and Shi, 2023). |

Performance evaluation and prediction are crucial in achieving this objective, with performance modeling as a key solution despite the complexities involved in assessing these blockchains. This survey examines prior research concerning the performance modeling blockchain systems, specifically focusing on public permissionless blockchains. Initially, it provides foundational knowledge about these blockchains and the crucial performance parameters for their assessment. Additionally, the study delves into research on the performance modeling of public permissionless blockchains, predominantly considering these systems as bulk service queues. It also examines prior studies on workload and traffic modeling, characterization, and analysis within these blockchain networks. By analyzing existing research, our survey aims to provide insights and recommendations for researchers keen on enhancing the performance of public permissionless blockchains or devising novel mechanisms in this domain. |

This paper presents an DLT-based architectural pattern and technology solution known as SmartQC that aims to provide an extensible and flexible approach to integrating DLT technology into existing workflows and processes. SmartQC offers an opportunity to make processes more time efficient, reliable, and robust by providing two key features i) data integrity through immutable ledgers and ii) automation of business workflows leveraging smart contracts. The paper will present the system architecture, extensible data model and the application of SmartQC in the context of example smart manufacturing applications. |

In particular, we distinguish between authentication factors that are verified against the blockchain and the ones verified locally (or against a centralized party). With this in mind, we define notions for $k-factor$ authentication against the blockchain and $k-factor$ authentication against the authentication factors. Based on these notions, we propose a classification of authentication schemes. We extend our classification to accommodate the threshold signatures and signing transactions by centralized parties (such as exchanges or co-signing services). Finally, we apply our classification to existing wallet solutions, which we compare based on various security and key-management features. |

Robust solutions are needed to mitigate vulnerabilities in manufacturing and integration. This paper puts forth a novel blockchain-based approach to secure OPEN-RAN equipment through its lifecycle. By combining firmware authentication codes, a permissioned blockchain ledger, and equipment node validators, we architect a tamper-resistant ecosystem to track provenance. The outlined design, while conceptual, establishes a foundation and roadmap for future realization. Through careful implementation planning, development of core components like firmware signed hashes and smart contracts, and rigorous performance evaluation, this paper can evolve from concept to practice. There is a vivid potential to make OPEN-RAN supply chains corner to corner secure, igniting further research and real-world deployment. |
|**2024-02-27**|**PureLottery: Fair and Bias-Resistant Leader Election with a Novel Single-Elimination Tournament Algorithm**|Jonas Ballweg et.al.|[2402.17459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17459)| Leader Election (LE) is crucial in distributed systems and blockchain technology, ensuring one participant acts as the leader. Traditional LE methods often depend on distributed random number generation (RNG), facing issues like vulnerability to manipulation, lack of fairness, and the need for complex procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS). This Bachelor's thesis presents a novel approach to randomized LE, leveraging a game-theoretic assumption that participants, aiming to be chosen as leaders, will naturally avoid actions that diminish their chances. This perspective simplifies LE by eliminating the need for decentralized RNG. Introducing PureLottery, inspired by single-elimination sports tournaments, this method offers a fair, bias-resistant, and efficient LE solution for blockchain environments. It operates on the principle of two participants competing in each match, rendering collusion efforts useless. PureLottery stands out for its low computational and communication complexity, suitable for smart contract implementation. It provides strong game-theoretic incentives for honesty and is robust against adversaries, ensuring no increase in election chances through dishonesty. The protocol guarantees that each honest player has at least a 1/n chance of winning, irrespective of adversary manipulation among the other n-1 participants. PureLottery can also address related problems like participant ranking, electing multiple leaders, and leader aversion, showcasing its versatility across various applications, including lotteries and blockchain protocols. An open-source implementation is made available for public use. |

|**2024-02-27**|**Time-Restricted Double-Spending Attack on PoW-based Blockchains**|Yiming Jiang et.al.|[2402.17223](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17223)| Numerous blockchain applications are designed with tasks that naturally have finite durations, and hence, a double-spending attack (DSA) on such blockchain applications leans towards being conducted within a finite timeframe, specifically before the completion of their tasks. Furthermore, existing research suggests that practical attackers typically favor executing a DSA within a finite timeframe due to their limited computational resources. These observations serve as the impetus for this paper to investigate a time-restricted DSA (TR-DSA) model on Proof-of-Work based blockchains. In this TR-DSA model, an attacker only mines its branch within a finite timeframe, and the TR-DSA is considered unsuccessful if the attacker's branch fails to surpass the honest miners' branch when the honest miners' branch has grown by a specific number of blocks. First, we developed a general closed-form expression for the success probability of a TR-DSA. This developed probability not only can assist in evaluating the risk of a DSA on blockchain applications with timely tasks, but also can enable practical attackers with limited computational resources to assess the feasibility and expected reward of launching a TR-DSA. In addition, we provide rigorous proof that the success probability of a TR-DSA is no greater than that of a time-unrestricted DSA where the attacker indefinitely mines its branch. This result implies that blockchain applications with timely tasks are less vulnerable to DSAs than blockchain applications that provide attackers with an unlimited timeframe for their attacks. Furthermore, we show that the success probability of a TR-DSA is always smaller than one even though the attacker controls more than half of the hash rate in the network. This result alerts attackers that there is still a risk of failure in launching a TR-DSA even if they amass a majority of the hash rate in the network. |

The unique capabilities of blockchain, such as immutability and transparency, enable new business models of distributed data storage, point-to-point transactions, and decentralized autonomous organizations. In this paper, we focus on blockchain-based securities trading, in which blockchain technology plays a vital role in financial services as it ultimately lifts trust and frees the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. We investigate the 12 most popular blockchain platforms and elaborate on 6 platforms that are related to finance, seeking to provide a panorama of securities trading practices. Meanwhile, this survey provides a comprehensive summary of blockchain-based securities trading applications. We gather numerous practical applications of blockchain-based securities trading and categorize them into four distinct categories. For each category, we introduce a typical example and explain how blockchain contributes to solving the key problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. Finally, we provide interesting observations ranging from mainstream blockchain-based financial institutions to security issues of decentralized finance applications, aiming to picture the current blockchain ecosystem in finance. |
|**2024-02-26**|**Decentralized Federated Unlearning on Blockchain**|Xiao Liu et.al.|[2402.16294](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16294)| Blockchained Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining traction for ensuring the integrity and traceability of FL processes. Blockchained FL involves participants training models locally with their data and subsequently publishing the models on the blockchain, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-like inheritance structure that represents the model relationship. However, this particular DAG-based structure presents challenges in updating models with sensitive data, due to the complexity and overhead involved. To address this, we propose Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a generic framework that redesigns the blockchain structure using Chameleon Hash (CH) technology to mitigate the complexity of model updating, thereby reducing the computational and consensus costs of unlearning tasks.Furthermore, BlockFUL supports various federated unlearning methods, ensuring the integrity and traceability of model updates, whether conducted in parallel or serial. We conduct a comprehensive study of two typical unlearning methods, gradient ascent and re-training, demonstrating the efficient unlearning workflow in these two categories with minimal CH and block update operations. Additionally, we compare the computation and communication costs of these methods. |

A key challenge toward implementing data sharding is verifying whether the entirety of a block's data is available in the network (across its shards). A central technique proposed to conduct this verification uses erasure coded blocks and is called data availability sampling (DAS). While the high-level protocol details of DAS has been well discussed in the community, discussions around how such a protocol will be implemented at the peer-to-peer layer are lacking. We identify random sampling of nodes as a fundamental primitive necessary to carry out DAS and present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling node that uses verifiable random walks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of a large number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., 50% of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for DAS functions in both full nodes and light nodes. |

Driven by the movement toward Web 3.0, recent systems started to provide distributed services, such as computation outsourcing or file storage, on top of the currency exchange medium. By allowing anyone to join and collect payments for serving others, these systems create decentralized markets for trading digital resources. Yet, there is still a big gap between the promise of these markets and their practical viability. Existing initiatives are still early-stage and have already encountered security and efficiency obstacles. At the same time, existing work around promising ideas, specifically sidechains, fall short in exploiting their full potential in addressing these problems.   To bridge this gap, we propose chainBoost, a secure performance booster for decentralized resource markets. It expedites service related operations, reduces the blockchain size, and supports flexible service-payment exchange modalities at low overhead. At its core, chainBoost employs a sidechain, that has a (security and semantic) mutual-dependence with the mainchain, to which the system offloads heavy/frequent operations. To enable it, we develop a novel sidechain architecture composed of temporary and permanent blocks, a block suppression mechanism to prune the sidechain, a syncing protocol to permit arbitrary data exchange between the two chains, and an autorecovery protocol to support robustness and resilience. We analyze the security of chainBoost, and implement a proof-of-concept prototype for a distributed file storage market as a use case. For a market handling around 2000 transactions per round, our experiments show up to 11x improvement in throughput and 94% reduction in confirmation time. They also show that chainBoost can reduce the main blockchain size by around 90%. |
|**2024-02-24**|**On the Redistribution of Maximal Extractable Value: A Dynamic Mechanism**|Pedro Braga et.al.|[2402.15849](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15849)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a new frontier in the design of blockchain systems. The marriage between decentralization and finance gives the power to block producers (a.k.a., miners) not only to select and add transactions to the blockchain but, crucially, also to order them so as to extract as much financial gain as possible for themselves. Whilst this price may be unavoidable for the service provided by block producers, users of the chain may in the long run prefer to use less predatory systems. In this paper, we propose to make the MEV extraction rate part of the protocol design space. Our aim is to leverage this parameter to maintain a healthy balance between miners (who need to be compensated) and users (who need to feel encouraged to transact). Inspired by the principles introduced by EIP-1559 for transaction fees, we design a dynamic mechanism which updates the MEV extraction rate with the goal of stabilizing it at a target value. We analyse the evolution of this dynamic mechanism under various market conditions and provide formal guarantees about its long-term performance. Our results show that even when the system behavior is provably chaotic, the dynamics guarantee long-term liveness (survival) and robustness of the system. The main takeaway from our work is that the proposed system exhibits desirable behavior (near-optimal performance) even when it operates in out of equilibrium conditions that are often met in practice. Our work establishes, the first to our knowledge, dynamic framework for the integral problem of MEV sharing between extractors and users. |

Therefore, message authentication is a crucial security feature in drone communications. This paper presents a Blockchain-based Efficient, and Trusted Authentication scheme for UAV communication, BETA-UAV, which exploits the inherent properties of blockchain technology concerning memorability and is immutable to record communication sessions via transactions using a smart contract. The smart contract in BETA-UAV allows participants to publish and call transactions from the blockchain network. Furthermore, transaction addresses are proof of freshness and trustworthiness for subsequent transmissions. Furthermore, we investigated their ability to resist active attacks, such as impersonation, replaying, and modification. In addition, we evaluate the gas costs associated with the functions of the smart contract by implementing a BETA-UAV on the Ethereum public blockchain. A comparison of the computation and communication overheads shows that the proposed approach can save significant costs over traditional techniques. |

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer enormous potential for agile relief coordination in these scenarios. However, effectively leveraging UAV fleets poses additional challenges around security, privacy, and efficient collaboration across response agencies. This paper presents a robust blockchain-enabled framework to address these challenges by integrating a consortium blockchain model, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques to securely coordinate UAV fleets for disaster response. Specifically, we make two key contributions: a consortium blockchain architecture for secure and private multi-agency coordination; and an optimized consensus protocol balancing efficiency and fault tolerance using a delegated proof of stake practical byzantine fault tolerance (DPoS-PBFT). Comprehensive simulations showcase the framework's ability to enhance transparency, automation, scalability, and cyber-attack resilience for UAV coordination in post-disaster networks. |
|**2024-02-23**|**Trustworthy confidential virtual machines for the masses**|Anna Galanou et.al.|[2402.15277](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15277)| Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure. |

Despite the promise, the high computational demands of AI on blockchain raise significant privacy and efficiency concerns. The Optimistic Privacy-Preserving AI (opp/ai) framework is introduced as a pioneering solution to these issues, striking a balance between privacy protection and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) for privacy with Optimistic Machine Learning (opML) for efficiency, creating a hybrid model tailored for blockchain AI services. This study presents the opp/ai framework, delves into the privacy features of zkML, and assesses the framework's performance and adaptability across different scenarios. |

The challenge lies in securely storing vast amounts of data and extracting useful information to promptly identify unhealthy bridge conditions. To address this challenge, we propose BIONIB, wherein real-time IoT data is stored on the blockchain for monitoring bridges. One of the emerging blockchains, EOSIO is used because of its exceptional scaling capabilities for monitoring the health of bridges. The approach involves collecting data from IoT sensors and using an unsupervised machine learning-based technique called the Novelty Index (NI) to observe meaningful patterns in the data. Smart contracts of EOSIO are used in implementation because of their efficiency, security, and programmability, making them well-suited for handling complex transactions and automating processes within decentralized applications. BIONIB provides secure storage benefits of blockchain, as well as useful predictions based on the NI. Performance analysis uses real-time data collected from IoT sensors at the bridge in healthy and unhealthy states. The data is collected with extensive experimentation with different loads, climatic conditions, and the health of the bridge. The performance of BIONIB under varying numbers of sensors and various numbers of participating blockchain nodes is observed. We observe a tradeoff between throughput, latency, and computational resources. Storage efficiency can be increased by manifolds with a slight increase in latency caused by NI calculation. As latency is not a significant concern in bridge health applications, the results demonstrate that BIONIB has high throughput, parallel processing, and high security while efficiently scaled. |
|**2024-02-22**|**Stability of P2P Networks Under Greedy Peering (Full Version)**|Lucianna Kiffer et.al.|[2402.14666](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14666)| Major cryptocurrency networks have relied on random peering choice rules for making connections in their peer-to-peer networks. Generally, these choices have good properties, particularly for open, permissionless networks. Random peering choices however do not take into account that some actors may choose to optimize who they connect to such that they are quicker to hear about information being propagated in the network. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of such greedy strategies. We study a model in which nodes select peers with the objective of minimizing their average distance to a designated subset of nodes in the network, and consider the impact of several factors including the peer selection process, degree constraints, and the size of the designated subset. The latter is particularly interesting in the context of blockchain networks as generally only a subset of nodes are the propagation source for content.   We first analyze an idealized version of the game where each node has full knowledge of the current network and aims to select the $d$ best connections, and prove the existence of equilibria under various model assumptions. Since in reality nodes only have local knowledge based on their peers' behavior, we also study a greedy protocol which runs in rounds, with each node replacing its worst-performing edge with a new random edge. We exactly characterize stability properties of networks that evolve with this peering rule and derive regimes where stability is possible and even inevitable. We also run extensive simulations with this peering rule examining both how the network evolves and how different network parameters affect the stability properties of the network. Our findings generally show that the only stable networks that arise from greedy peering choices are low-diameter and result in disparate performance for nodes in the network. |

Setting up meaningful tests for permissionless blockchain technology is a notoriously complex task for several reasons: software is complex, large number of nodes are involved, network is non ideal, etc. Developers usually adopt small virtual laboratories or costly real devnets, based on real software. Researchers usually prefer simulations of a large number of nodes, based on simplified models. In this paper, we aim to obtain the advantages of both approaches, i.e., performing large, realistic, inexpensive, and flexible experiments, using real blockchain software within a virtual environment. To do that, we tackle the challenge of running large blockchain networks in a single physical machine, leveraging Linux and Docker. We analyze a number of problems that arise when large blockchain networks are emulated and we provide technical solutions for all of them. Finally, we describe two experiences of emulating fairly large blockchain networks on a single machine, adopting both research oriented and production oriented software, and involving up to more than 3000 containers. |
|**2024-02-21**|**Trustworthy Distributed Certification of Program Execution**|Alex Wolf et.al.|[2402.13792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13792)| Verifying the execution of a program is complicated and often limited by the inability to validate the code's correctness. It is a crucial aspect of scientific research, where it is needed to ensure the reproducibility and validity of experimental results. Similarly, in customer software testing, it is difficult for customers to verify that their specific program version was tested or executed at all. Existing state-of-the-art solutions, such as hardware-based approaches, constraint solvers, and verifiable computation systems, do not provide definitive proof of execution, which hinders reliable testing and analysis of program results. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that combines a prototype programming language called Mona with a certification protocol OCCP to enable the distributed and decentralized re-execution of program segments. Our protocol allows for certification of program segments in a distributed, immutable, and trustworthy system without the need for naive re-execution, resulting in significant improvements in terms of time and computational resources used. We also explore the use of blockchain technology to manage the protocol workflow following other approaches in this space. Our approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of program execution verification and opens up opportunities for further research and development in this area. Our findings demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in reducing the number of program executions compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, thus improving the efficiency of certifying program executions. |

Objective: In this paper, we propose architecture and technical aspects concerning the creation of a BBIE, underlining the advantages supplied and the logic decomposition among the business and storage components. Method: The requirements are derived from the current needs of the collaborative business and the data collected by surveying practitioners. To get these needs we followed the Grounded Theory research approach. We validate our architectural schema against a case study dealing with the management of a wine supply chain, also involving different companies and supervision authorities. Results: The proposed solution integrates blockchain-based applications with the existing information system as a module of the ecosystem, leveraging on the low costs, scalability, and high-level security because of the restricted access to the network. Conclusion: We must go a long way in deepening and refining the possibilities offered by technology in supporting innovative multi-organizational business models. BBIEs can contribute substantially to paving the way in such a direction. |

Use of Blockchain technology-based platform can significantly improve scalability and response time for processing of claims which are otherwise manually-intensive and time-consuming. However, the chaincodes involved within the processes that issue claims, approve or deny them as required, need to be formally verified to ensure secure and reliable processing of transactions in Blockchain. In this paper, we use a formal modeling approach to verify various processes and their underlying chaincodes relating to different stages in insurance claims processing viz., issuance, approval, denial, and flagging for fraud investigation by using linear temporal logic (LTL). We simulate the formalism on the chaincodes and analyze the breach of chaincodes via model checking. |

DSNs bring together affordable storage resources from around the world to provide robust, decentralized storage services for tens of thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). However, existing DSNs do not offer verifiability when implementing erasure coding for redundant storage, making them vulnerable to Byzantine encoders. Additionally, there is a lack of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for optimal resilience in DSNs. This paper introduces BFT-DSN, a Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized storage network designed to address these challenges. BFT-DSN combines storage-weighted BFT consensus with erasure coding and incorporates homomorphic fingerprints and weighted threshold signatures for decentralized verification. The implementation of BFT-DSN demonstrates its comparable performance in terms of storage cost and latency as well as superior performance in Byzantine resilience when compared to existing industrial decentralized storage networks. |

|**2024-02-19**|**Evaluation of ChatGPT's Smart Contract Auditing Capabilities Based on Chain of Thought**|Yuying Du et.al.|[2402.12023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12023)| Smart contracts, as a key component of blockchain technology, play a crucial role in ensuring the automation of transactions and adherence to protocol rules. However, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, which, if exploited, can lead to significant asset losses. This study explores the potential of enhancing smart contract security audits using the GPT-4 model. We utilized a dataset of 35 smart contracts from the SolidiFI-benchmark vulnerability library, containing 732 vulnerabilities, and compared it with five other vulnerability detection tools to evaluate GPT-4's ability to identify seven common types of vulnerabilities. Moreover, we assessed GPT-4's performance in code parsing and vulnerability capture by simulating a professional auditor's auditing process using CoT(Chain of Thought) prompts based on the audit reports of eight groups of smart contracts. We also evaluated GPT-4's ability to write Solidity Proof of Concepts (PoCs). Through experimentation, we found that GPT-4 performed poorly in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, with a high Precision of 96.6%, but a low Recall of 37.8%, and an F1-score of 41.1%, indicating a tendency to miss vulnerabilities during detection. Meanwhile, it demonstrated good contract code parsing capabilities, with an average comprehensive score of 6.5, capable of identifying the background information and functional relationships of smart contracts; in 60% of the cases, it could write usable PoCs, suggesting GPT-4 has significant potential application in PoC writing. These experimental results indicate that GPT-4 lacks the ability to detect smart contract vulnerabilities effectively, but its performance in contract code parsing and PoC writing demonstrates its significant potential as an auxiliary tool in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of smart contract security audits. |
|**2024-02-17**|**Exploring the Emerging Technologies within the Blockchain Landscape**|Mohammad Ali Tareq et.al.|[2402.11290](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11290)| Although blockchain technology was first introduced in 2008 and materialised in 2009, the early usage of blockchain were mainly limited to financial technologies, particularly cryptocurrencies. Later, blockchain became a widespread emerging technology, utilised in multifaceted sectors and applications. In fact, various new and innovative application of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are still continuously being researched and explored. On the other hand, smart-contracts were first introduced in 1990s, however, it did not gain enough popularity until being integrated with blockchain technologies lately. The duo lately been seen as the key to many innovations in various industries and sectors. So, we took data from 1445 blockchain-related patent documents and tried to map out the historical and current trends in patenting activities in the blockchain field. This helps us get a better grasp of how blockchain technologies are evolving and being tracked. In addition to serving as an indicator of science and technology growth, patents are also used to judge the research potential and development of a particular technology. |

Despite its advantages, blockchain networks are susceptible to anomalies and frauds, posing significant risks to their integrity and security. This paper offers a detailed examination of blockchain's key definitions and properties, alongside a thorough analysis of the various anomalies and frauds that undermine these networks. It describes an array of detection and prevention strategies, encompassing statistical and machine learning methods, game-theoretic solutions, digital forensics, reputation-based systems, and comprehensive risk assessment techniques. Through case studies, we explore practical applications of anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain networks, extracting valuable insights and implications for both current practice and future research. Moreover, we spotlight emerging trends and challenges within the field, proposing directions for future investigation and technological development. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, this paper seeks to provide a technical, in-depth overview of anomaly and fraud detection within blockchain networks, marking a significant step forward in the search for enhanced network security and reliability. |

|**2024-02-16**|**Towards benchmarking of Solidity verification tools**|Massimo Bartoletti et.al.|[2402.10750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10750)| Formal verification of smart contracts has become a hot topic in academic and industrial research, given the growing value of assets managed by decentralized applications and the consequent incentive for adversaries to tamper with them. Most of the current research on the verification of contracts revolves around Solidity, the main high-level language supported by Ethereum and other leading blockchains. Although bug detection tools for Solidity have been proliferating almost since the inception of Ethereum, only in the last few years we have seen verification tools capable of proving that a contract respects some desirable properties. An open issue is how to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these tools: indeed, the existing benchmarks for general-purpose programming languages cannot be adapted to Solidity, given substantial differences in the programming model and in the desirable properties. We address this problem by proposing an open benchmark for Solidity verification tools. By exploiting our benchmark, we compare two leading tools, SolCMC and Certora, discussing their completeness, soundness and expressiveness limitations. |

Blockchain accounts secure most on-chain assets in this huge market (Web-12). This paper initiates a universal blockchain account model from a comprehensive review of blockchain account development, encompassing both academic and industry perspectives. This paper uses a model analysis method to analysis the account progress and create high level new account model. And it uses systematic literature review method to search, filter, analysis and evaluate the papers about account models and analyzes related technology trade-offs. Searching with key words: blockchain, account, private key and security in WOS, Scopus and Bitcoin and Ethereum community repositories, this research provides in-depth insights into the design and evaluation of account models, from traditional bank accounts to Bitcoin, EVM-adaptable, and abstraction accounts. Through data-driven comparisons of account models (security, cost, adoption), this study also explores future directions and provides an overview of cross-model account theory, guiding further blockchain research. This paper leaves deeper dives into model change drivers, application technology advancements. |
|**2024-02-15**|**Transaction Capacity, Security and Latency in Blockchains**|Mustafa Doger et.al.|[2402.10138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10138)| We analyze how secure a block is after the block becomes k-deep, i.e., security-latency, for Nakamoto consensus under an exponential network delay model. We give parameter regimes for which transactions are safe when sufficiently deep in the chain. We compare our results for Nakamoto consensus under bounded network delay models and obtain analogous bounds for safety violation threshold. Next, modeling the blockchain system as a batch service queue with exponential network delay, we connect the security-latency analysis to sustainable transaction rate of the queue system. As our model assumes exponential network delay, batch service queue models give a meaningful trade-off between transaction capacity, security and latency. As adversary can attack the queue service to hamper the service process, we consider two different attacks for adversary. In an extreme scenario, we modify the selfish-mining attack for this purpose and consider its effect on the sustainable transaction rate of the queue. |

The Ethereum community has proposed comprehensive data-sharding techniques to overcome storage, computational, and network processing limitations. In this context, the propagation and availability of large blocks become the subject of research to achieve scalable data-sharding. This paper provides insights after exploring the usage of a Kademlia-based DHT to enable Data Availability Sampling (DAS) in Ethereum. It presents a DAS-DHT simulator to study this problem and validates the results of the simulator with experiments in a real DHT network, IPFS. Our results help us understand what parts of DAS can be achieved based on existing Kademlia DHT solutions and which ones cannot. We discuss the limitations of DHT solutions and discuss other alternatives. |

The strategic importance of choosing \emph{when} to vote arises when votes are public, such as in online event scheduling polls (e.g., Doodle), or in blockchain governance mechanisms. In particular, there is a tension between voting early to influence future votes and waiting to observe interim results and avoid voting costs if the outcome has already been decided.   Our study draws on empirical findings showing that "temporal" bandwagon effects occur when interim results are revealed to the electorate: late voters are more likely to vote for leading candidates. To capture this phenomenon, we analyze a novel model where the electorate consists of informed voters who have a preferred candidate, and uninformed swing voters who can be swayed according to the interim outcome at the time of voting. In our main results, we prove the existence of equilibria where both early and late voting occur with a positive probability, and we characterize conditions that lead to the appearance of "last minute" voting behavior, where all informed voters vote late. |

However, current Web 3.0 applications supported by blockchain infrastructure still cannot support complex data analytics tasks in a scalable and privacy-preserving way. This paper introduces the emerging federated analytics (FA) paradigm into the realm of Web 3.0 services, enabling data to stay local while still contributing to complex web analytics tasks in a privacy-preserving way. We propose FedWeb, a tailored FA design for important frequent pattern mining tasks in Web 3.0. FedWeb remarkably reduces the number of required participating data owners to support privacy-preserving Web 3.0 data analytics based on a novel distributed differential privacy technique. The correctness of mining results is guaranteed by a theoretically rigid candidate filtering scheme based on Hoeffding's inequality and Chebychev's inequality. Two response budget saving solutions are proposed to further reduce participating data owners. Experiments on three representative Web 3.0 scenarios show that FedWeb can improve data utility by ~25.3% and reduce the participating data owners by ~98.4%. |
|**2024-04-21**|**Mechanism Design for Automated Market Makers**|T-H. Hubert Chan et.al.|[2402.09357](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09357)| Blockchains have popularized automated market makers (AMMs). An AMM exchange is an application running on a blockchain which maintains a pool of crypto-assets and automatically trades assets with users governed by some pricing function that prices the assets based on their relative demand/supply. AMMs have created an important challenge commonly known as the Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In particular, the miners who control the contents and ordering of transactions in a block can extract value by front-running and back-running users' transactions, leading to arbitrage opportunities that guarantee them risk-free returns.   In this paper, we consider how to design AMM mechanisms that eliminate MEV opportunities. Specifically, we propose a new AMM mechanism that processes all transactions contained within a block in a batch. We show that our new mechanism satisfies two tiers of guarantees. First, for legacy blockchains where each block is proposed by a single (possibly rotating) miner, we prove that our mechanism satisfies arbitrage resilience, i.e., a miner cannot gain risk-free profit. Moreover, we also guarantee fair treatment among all transactions within the same block, such that the miner is unable to sell off favorable positions in the block to users or arbitragers. Second, for blockchains where the block proposal process is decentralized and offers sequencing-fairness, we prove a stronger notion called incentive compatibility -- roughly speaking, we guarantee that any individual user's best response is to follow the honest strategy. |
|**2024-06-19**|**Collusion-Resilience in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Hao Chung et.al.|[2402.09321](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321)| Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions included and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated the formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of collusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism satisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention between transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many eligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23) considered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called c-side-contract-proofness (c-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention between transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and c-SCP for any c at least 1. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to "steal from the protocol." On the other hand, the c-SCP condition requires that a coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit through strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the users outside the coalition).   Our main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between transactions, no (possibly randomized) TFM in which users are expected to bid truthfully satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness. This result resolves the main open question in Roughgarden (EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of the basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented. |

Existing TEE RA designs employ a centralized trust model where they rely on a single provisioned secret key and a centralized verifier to establish trust for remote parties. This model is however brittle and can be untrusted under advanced attacks nowadays. Besides, most designs only provide fixed functionalities once deployed, making them hard to adapt to different needs on availability, Quality of Service (QoS), etc.   Therefore, we propose JANUS, an open and resilient TEE RA scheme. To decentralize trust, we, on one hand, introduce Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) as an intrinsic root of trust (RoT) in TEE to provide additional measurements and cryptographic enhancements. On the other hand, we use blockchain and smart contract to realize decentralized verification and result audit. Furthermore, we design an automated turnout mechanism that allows JANUS to remain resilient and offer flexible RA services under various situations. We provide a UC-based security proof and demonstrate the scalability and generality of JANUS by implementing an open-sourced prototype. |
|**2024-05-18**|**Multidimensional Blockchain Fees are (Essentially) Optimal**|Guillermo Angeris et.al.|[2402.08661](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08661)| In this paper we show that, using only mild assumptions, previously proposed multidimensional blockchain fee markets are essentially optimal, even against worst-case adversaries. In particular, we show that the average welfare gap between the following two scenarios is at most $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the length of the time horizon considered. In the first scenario, the designer knows all future actions by users and is allowed to fix the optimal prices of resources ahead of time, based on the designer's oracular knowledge of those actions. In the second, the prices are updated by a very simple algorithm that does not have this oracular knowledge, a special case of which is similar to EIP-1559, the base fee mechanism used by the Ethereum blockchain. Roughly speaking, this means that, on average, over a reasonable timescale, there is no difference in welfare between 'correctly' fixing the prices, with oracular knowledge of the future, when compared to the proposed algorithm. We show a matching lower bound of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ for any implementable algorithm and also separately consider the case where the adversary is known to be stochastic. |

We show that continuous-time best-response dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agents' behavior in these games. |
|**2024-02-19**|**zk-IoT: Securing the Internet of Things with Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Blockchain Platforms**|Gholamreza Ramezan et.al.|[2402.08322](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08322)| This paper introduces the zk-IoT framework, a novel approach to enhancing the security of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems through the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on blockchain platforms. Our framework ensures the integrity of firmware execution and data processing in potentially compromised IoT devices. By leveraging the concept of ZKP, we establish a trust layer that facilitates secure, autonomous communication between IoT devices in environments where devices may not inherently trust each other. The framework includes zk-Devices, which utilize functional commitment to generate proofs for executed programs, and service contracts for encoding interaction logic among devices. It also utilizes a blockchain layer and a relayer as a ZKP storage and data communication protocol, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that proof generation, reading, and verification take approximately 694, 5078, and 19 milliseconds in our system setup, respectively. These timings meet the practical requirements for IoT device communication, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our solution. The zk-IoT framework represents a significant advancement in the realm of IoT security, paving the way for reliable and scalable IoT networks across various applications, such as smart city infrastructures, healthcare systems, and industrial automation. |
|**2024-02-26**|**The Blocklace: A Universal, Byzantine Fault-Tolerant, Conflict-free Replicated Data Type**|Paulo Sérgio Almeida et.al.|[2402.08068](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08068)| Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are designed for replica convergence without global coordination or consensus. Recent work has achieves the same in a Byzantine environment, through DAG-like structures based on cryptographic hashes of content.   The blocklace is a partially-ordered generalization of the blockchain in which each block has any finite number of signed hash pointers to preceding blocks. We show that the blocklace datatype, with the sole operation of adding a single block, is a CRDT: it is both a pure operation-based CRDT, with self-tagging; and a delta-state CRDT, under a slight generalization of the delta framework. Allowing arbitrary values as payload, the blocklace can also be seen as a universal Byzantine fault-tolerant implementation for arbitrary CRDTs, under the operation-based approach.   Current approaches only care about CRDT convergence, being equivocation-tolerant (they do not detect or prevent equivocations), allowing a Byzantine node to cause an arbitrary amount of harm by polluting the CRDT state with an infinite number of equivocations.   We show that a blocklace can be used not only in an equivocation-tolerant way, but also so as to detect and eventually exclude Byzantine behavior, namely equivocations, even under the presence of collusion. The blocklace CRDT protocol ensures that the Byzantine nodes may harm only a finite prefix of the computation. |
|**2024-02-11**|**Proof of Diligence: Cryptoeconomic Security for Rollups**|Peiyao Sheng et.al.|[2402.07241](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07241)| Layer 1 (L1) blockchains such as Ethereum are secured under an "honest supermajority of stake" assumption for a large pool of validators who verify each and every transaction on it. This high security comes at a scalability cost which not only effects the throughput of the blockchain but also results in high gas fees for executing transactions on chain. The most successful solution for this problem is provided by optimistic rollups, Layer 2 (L2) blockchains that execute transactions outside L1 but post the transaction data on L1. The security for such L2 chains is argued, informally, under the assumption that a set of nodes will check the transaction data posted on L1 and raise an alarm (a fraud proof) if faulty transactions are detected. However, all current deployments lack a proper incentive mechanism for ensuring that these nodes will do their job ``diligently'', and simply rely on a cursory incentive alignment argument for security. We solve this problem by introducing an incentivized watchtower network designed to serve as the first line of defense for rollups. Our main contribution is a ``Proof of Diligence'' protocol that requires watchtowers to continuously provide a proof that they have verified L2 assertions and get rewarded for the same. Proof of Diligence protocol includes a carefully-designed incentive mechanism that is provably secure when watchtowers are rational actors, under a mild rational independence assumption.   Our proposed system is now live on Ethereum testnet. We deployed a watchtower network and implemented Proof of Diligence for multiple optimistic rollups. We extract execution as well as inclusion proofs for transactions as a part of the bounty. Each watchtower has minimal additional computational overhead beyond access to standard L1 and L2 RPC nodes. |

However, the existing client/server infrastructure poses significant security and privacy challenges, necessitating strict adherence to healthcare data regulations. To combat these issues, a decentralized approach is imperative, and blockchain technology emerges as a compelling solution for strengthening Internet of Things and medical systems security. This paper introduces HNMblock, a model that elevates the realms of epidemiological monitoring, medical system security, and wellness enhancement. By harnessing the transparency and immutability inherent in blockchain, HNMblock empowers real-time, tamper-proof tracking of epidemiological data, enabling swift responses to disease outbreaks. Furthermore, it fortifies the security of medical systems through advanced cryptographic techniques and smart contracts, with a paramount focus on safeguarding patient privacy. HNMblock also fosters personalized healthcare, encouraging patient involvement and data-informed decision-making. The integration of blockchain within the healthcare domain, as exemplified by HNMblock, holds the potential to revolutionize data management, epidemiological surveillance, and wellness, as meticulously explored in this research article. |

Santos et.al.|[2402.06704](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06704)| Document management in the rental market is a critical process to ensure the accuracy of financial transactions and regulatory compliance in the sector. In Portugal, the challenges include the complexity of legislation, particularly GDPR non-compliance, lack of transparency, and bureaucratic process inefficiency. With this in mind, a solution based on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain platform, is presented for the implementation of a document management system for the rental process. This system oversees the rental process, which consists of three phases: the application for a property by the prospective tenant through the upload of necessary documents, acceptance/rejection by the landlord of various received applications, and the creation of a report by the system, which only the auditor can request and view. The system smart contract records metadata associated with the documents (hash, owner) and coordinates requests for file access by landlords to prospective tenants. Thus, the system is responsible for creating immutable and traceable records of the entire process. The underlying platform serves as the foundation for conducting future audits. After the landlord verifies the files and accepts the rental proposal, any authorised auditor can request a report for a property by accessing the records through the final report, which includes all events that occurred during the process. |

The paper leverages theoretical frameworks such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, and Bernardo Kastrup's analytical idealism to build the argument for achieving embodied AGI. It contends that our perceived outer reality is a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and that AGI could embody a higher consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the developmental stages of AGI, the requirements for the emergence of an embodied AGI, the importance of a calibrated symbolic interface for AGI, and the key role played by the metaverse, decentralized systems, open-source blockchain technology, as well as open-source AI research. It also explores the idea of a feedback loop between AGI and human users in metaverse spaces as a tool for AGI calibration, as well as the role of local homeostasis and decentralized governance as preconditions for achieving a stable embodied AGI. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI. |

In bribing attacks, an adversary offers participants a reward in exchange for instructing them how to behave, with the goal of attacking the protocol's properties. Specifically, our work focuses on adversaries that target blockchain safety. We consider two types of bribing, depending on how the bribes are awarded: i) guided bribing, where the bribe is given as long as the bribed party behaves as instructed; ii) effective bribing, where bribes are conditional on the attack's success, w.r.t. well-defined metrics. We analyze each type of attack in a game theoretic setting and identify relevant equilibria. In guided bribing, we show that the protocol is not an equilibrium and then describe good equilibria, where the attack is unsuccessful, and a negative one, where all parties are bribed such that the attack succeeds. In effective bribing, we show that both the protocol and the "all bribed" setting are equilibria. Using the identified equilibria, we then compute bounds on the Prices of Stability and Anarchy. Our results indicate that additional mitigations are needed for guided bribing, so our analysis concludes with incentive-based mitigation techniques, namely slashing and dilution. Here, we present two positive results, that both render the protocol an equilibrium and achieve maximal welfare for all parties, and a negative result, wherein an attack becomes more plausible if it severely affects the ledger's token's market price. |

Multirobot systems (MRS) research has provided many approaches to establish control and communication layers to facilitate collaboration from a technical perspective, such as granting more autonomy to heterogeneous robotic groups through auction-based interactions in mesh networks. However, stakeholders' competing economic interests often prevent them from cooperating within a proprietary ecosystem. Related work suggests that distributed ledger technology (DLT) might serve as a mechanism for enterprises to coordinate workflows and trade services to explore space resources through a transparent, reliable, non-proprietary digital platform. We challenge this perspective by pointing to the core technical weaknesses of blockchains, in particular, increased energy consumption, low throughput, and full transparency through redundancy. Our objective is to advance the discussion in a direction where the benefits of DLT from an economic perspective are weighted against the drawbacks from a technical perspective. We finally present a possible DLT-driven heterogeneous MRS for map exploration to study the opportunities for economic collaboration and competitiveness. |
|**2024-02-08**|**Trustful Coopetitive Infrastructures for the New Space Exploration Era**|Renan Lima Baima et.al.|[2402.06014](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06014)| In the new space economy, space agencies, large enterprises, and start-ups aim to launch space multi-robot systems (MRS) for various in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) purposes, such as mapping, soil evaluation, and utility provisioning. However, these stakeholders' competing economic interests may hinder effective collaboration on a centralized digital platform. To address this issue, neutral and transparent infrastructures could facilitate coordination and value exchange among heterogeneous space MRS. While related work has expressed legitimate concerns about the technical challenges associated with blockchain use in space, we argue that weighing its potential economic benefits against its drawbacks is necessary. This paper presents a novel architectural framework and a comprehensive set of requirements for integrating blockchain technology in MRS, aiming to enhance coordination and data integrity in space exploration missions. We explored distributed ledger technology (DLT) to design a non-proprietary architecture for heterogeneous MRS and validated the prototype in a simulated lunar environment. The analyses of our implementation suggest global ISRU efficiency improvements for map exploration, compared to a corresponding group of individually acting robots, and that fostering a coopetitive environment may provide additional revenue opportunities for stakeholders. |

Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) to UAV networks has improved collaboration, privacy, resilience, and adaptability, making it a promising framework for UAV applications. However, implementing FL for UAV networks introduces drawbacks such as communication overhead, synchronization issues, scalability limitations, and resource constraints. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Blockchain-enabled Clustered and Scalable Federated Learning (BCS-FL) framework for UAV networks. This improves the decentralization, coordination, scalability, and efficiency of FL in large-scale UAV networks. The framework partitions UAV networks into separate clusters, coordinated by cluster head UAVs (CHs), to establish a connected graph. Clustering enables efficient coordination of updates to the ML model. Additionally, hybrid inter-cluster and intra-cluster model aggregation schemes generate the global model after each training round, improving collaboration and knowledge sharing among clusters. The numerical findings illustrate the achievement of convergence while also emphasizing the trade-offs between the effectiveness of training and communication efficiency. |
|**2024-02-08**|**Blockchain Based Residential Smart Rent**|André S. Proença et.al.|[2402.05737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05737)| The real estate market includes complex and inefficient mediation processes. Renting a property envolves multiple entities with different responsibilities and interests. Therefore it is imperative to establish a trustful relationship between parties through intermediaries such as notaries, banks or real estate agencies to avoid eventual disputes. Although an intermediary ensures trust, the current process still has some drawbacks concerning efficiency, costs, transparency, bureaucracy and data security. The blockchain technology aims to reduce this issues by providing transparent and secure real estate transactions. We propose a GDPR compliant blockchain-based residential smart rental platform, designed to allow both landlords and tenants to establish rental contracts and make rental payments securely. |
|**2024-02-08**|**Optimized Denial-of-Service Threats on the Scalability of LT Coded Blockchains**|Harikrishnan K. et.al.|[2402.05620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05620)| Coded blockchains have acquired prominence in the recent past as a promising approach to slash the storage costs as well as to facilitate scalability. Within this class, Luby Transform (LT) coded blockchains are an appealing choice for scalability in heterogeneous networks owing to the availability of a wide range of low-complexity LT decoders. While these architectures have been studied from the aspects of storage savings and scalability, not much is known in terms of their security vulnerabilities. Pointing at this research gap, in this work, we present novel denial-of-service (DoS) threats on LT coded blockchains that target nodes with specific decoding capabilities, thereby preventing them from joining the network. Our proposed threats are non-oblivious in nature, wherein adversaries gain access to the archived blocks, and choose to execute their threat on a subset of them based on underlying coding scheme. We show that our optimized threats can achieve the same level of damage as that of blind attacks, however, with limited amount of resources. This is the first work of its kind that opens up new questions on designing coded blockchains to jointly provide storage savings, scalability and resilience to optimized threats. |
|**2024-02-08**|**On Optimizing Deterministic Concurrent Scheduling for Smart Contracts and Blockchains**|Yaron Hay et.al.|[2402.05535](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05535)| Executing smart contracts is a compute and storage-intensive task, which currently dominates modern blockchain's performance. Given that computers are becoming increasingly multicore, concurrency is an attractive approach to improve programs' execution runtime. A unique challenge of blockchains is that all replicas (minors or validators) must execute all smart contracts in the same logical order to maintain the semantics of State Machine Replication (SMR). While non-conflicting transactions can be executed in any actual order, replicas need to enforce a unique logical order among all pairs of conflicting transactions.   In this work, we formally study the maximal level of parallelism obtainable when focusing on the conflict graphs between transactions packaged in the same block, rather than relying on the total ordering order. To that end, we describe a generic framework for Active State Machine Replication (ASMR) that is strictly serializable. The generic framework allows for shifting our focus to developing efficient execution engines for transactions without introducing non-deterministic results.   Then, we suggest the concept of graph scheduling, and the minimal latency scheduling problem, which we prove to be NP-Hard. We show that the restricted version of the problem for homogeneous transactions is equivalent to the classic Graph Vertex Coloring Problem, yet the heterogenous case is more complex. We discuss practical implications of these results. |
|**2024-06-05**|**A Solution for Commercializing, Decentralizing and Storing Electronic Medical Records by Integrating Proxy Re-Encryption, IPFS, and Blockchain**|Phong Tran et.al.|[2402.05498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05498)| The rapid expansion of user medical records across global systems presents not only opportunities but also new challenges in maintaining effective application models that ensure user privacy, controllability, and the ability to commercialize patient medical records. Moreover, the proliferation of data analysis models in healthcare institutions necessitates the decentralization and restorability of medical record data. It is imperative that user medical data collected from these systems can be easily analyzed and utilized even years after collection, without the risk of data loss due to numerous factors. Additionally, medical information must be authorized by the data owner, granting patients the right to accept or decline data usage requests from medical research agencies. In response, we propose an innovative solution for implementing a decentralized system utilizing an EVM-compatible blockchain and IPFS for decentralized storage. To ensure privacy and control, we employ Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE), a cryptographic authorized method, within the medical data marketplace. Our proposed architecture significantly reduces costs associated with granting read access to healthcare research agencies by minimizing the encryption and decryption time of stored records. Furthermore, it empowers users with enhanced control over their health data through tamperproof blockchain smart contracts and IPFS, safeguarding the integrity and privacy of their medical records. |

Epistral, an innovative media network that leverages blockchain technology, aims to be the world's first anti-mimetic media curation and consumption network, addressing the core challenges facing today's digital media landscape: unfair treatment of creators and manipulative consumer algorithms, and the complex task of effective regulation. This paper delves into the conceptualization, design, and potential impact of epistral and explores how it embodies McLuhan's and Girard's theories within the realm of blockchain technology and draws from Hayden's critique of democratic representation. The paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities presented by this new network, providing a broader discourse on the future of media consumption, distribution, and regulation. |

Therefore, evaluating their performance is crucial for investors and policymakers. This work presents a financial evaluation of early-stage firms' performance in 19 cybersecurity sectors using a private-equity dataset from 2010 to 2022 retrieved from Crunchbase. We observe firms, their primary and secondary activities, funding rounds, and pre and post-money valuations. We compare cybersecurity sectors regarding the amount raised over funding rounds and post-money valuations while inferring missing observations. We observe significant investor interest variations across categories, periods, and locations. In particular, we find the average capital raised (valuations) to range from USD 7.24 mln (USD 32.39 mln) for spam filtering to USD 45.46 mln (USD 447.22 mln) for the private cloud sector. Next, we assume a log process for returns computed from post-money valuations and estimate the expected returns, systematic and specific risks, and risk-adjusted returns of investments in early-stage firms belonging to cybersecurity sectors. Again, we observe substantial performance variations with annualized expected returns ranging from 9.72\% for privacy to 177.27\% for the blockchain sector. Finally, we show that overall, the cybersecurity industry performance is on par with previous results found in private equity. Our results shed light on the performance of cybersecurity investments and, thus, on investors' expectations about cybersecurity. |
|**2024-02-07**|**Token vs Equity for Startup Financing**|Guangye Cao et.al.|[2402.04662](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04662)| Why would a blockchain-based startup and its venture capital investors choose to finance by issuing tokens instead of equity? What would be their rates of return for each asset? This paper focuses on the liquidity difference between the two fundraising methods. I build a three-period model of an entrepreneur, two types of investors, and users. Some investors have unforeseen liquidity needs in the middle period that can only be met with tokens. The entrepreneur obtains higher payoff by issuing tokens instead of equity, and the payoff difference increases with investors risk-aversion and need for liquidity in the middle period, as well as the depth of the token market. |
|**2024-02-07**|**No Transaction Fees? No Problem! Achieving Fairness in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Sankarshan Damle et.al.|[2402.04634](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04634)| The recently proposed Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM) literature studies the strategic interaction between the miner of a block and the transaction creators (or users) in a blockchain. In a TFM, the miner includes transactions that maximize its utility while users submit fees for a slot in the block. The existing TFM literature focuses on satisfying standard incentive properties -- which may limit widespread adoption. We argue that a TFM is "fair" to the transaction creators if it satisfies specific notions, namely Zero-fee Transaction Inclusion and Monotonicity. First, we prove that one generally cannot ensure both these properties and prevent a miner's strategic manipulation. We also show that existing TFMs either do not satisfy these notions or do so at a high cost to the miners' utility. As such, we introduce a novel TFM using on-chain randomness -- rTFM. We prove that rTFM guarantees incentive compatibility for miners and users while satisfying our novel fairness constraints. |
|**2024-02-07**|**Minimizing Block Incentive Volatility Through Verkle Tree-Based Dynamic Transaction Storage**|Xiongfei Zhao et.al.|[2402.04533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04533)| Transaction fees are a crucial revenue source for miners in public and consortium blockchains. However, while public blockchains have additional revenue streams, transaction fees serve as the primary income for miners in consortium blockchains formed by various financial institutions. These miners allocate different levels of computing resources to process transactions and earn corresponding fees. Nonetheless, relying solely on transaction fees can lead to significant volatility and encourage non-standard mining behaviors, thereby posing threats to the blockchain's security and integrity. Despite previous attempts to mitigate the impact of transaction fees on illicit mining behaviors, a comprehensive solution to this vulnerability is yet to be established. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies to effectively minimize block incentive volatility. Our solution implements a Verkle tree-based storage mechanism to reduce bandwidth consumption. Moreover, to configure the DTS strategies, we evaluate several optimization algorithms and formulate the challenge as a Vehicle Routing Problem. Our experiments conducted using historical transactions from Bitcoin and remittance data from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reveal that the strategy focusing on time-based transaction incorporation priority, while excluding a designated space for small-fee transactions, as discovered by the gradient-based optimizer algorithm, proves most effective in reducing volatility. Hence, the DTS strategy can sustain stable block incentives irrespective of transaction types or user bidding behavior. Furthermore, the inclusion of higher-fee transactions, often smaller in size, can alleviate propagation delays and the occurrence of forks. |
|**2024-02-06**|**Decentralized Blockchain-based Robust Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandit**|Mengfan Xu et.al.|[2402.04417](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04417)| We study a robust multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem where multiple clients or participants are distributed on a fully decentralized blockchain, with the possibility of some being malicious. The rewards of arms are homogeneous among the clients, following time-invariant stochastic distributions that are revealed to the participants only when the system is secure enough. The system's objective is to efficiently ensure the cumulative rewards gained by the honest participants. To this end and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate advanced techniques from blockchains, as well as novel mechanisms, into the system to design optimal strategies for honest participants. This allows various malicious behaviors and the maintenance of participant privacy. More specifically, we randomly select a pool of validators who have access to all participants, design a brand-new consensus mechanism based on digital signatures for these validators, invent a UCB-based strategy that requires less information from participants through secure multi-party computation, and design the chain-participant interaction and an incentive mechanism to encourage participants' participation. Notably, we are the first to prove the theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithms by regret analyses in the context of optimality in blockchains. Unlike existing work that integrates blockchains with learning problems such as federated learning which mainly focuses on numerical optimality, we demonstrate that the regret of honest participants is upper bounded by $log{T}$ . This is consistent with the multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem without malicious participants and the robust multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with purely Byzantine attacks. |
|**2024-02-06**|**Merkle Trees in Blockchain: A Study of Collision Probability and Security Implications**|Oleksandr Kuznetsov et.al.|[2402.04367](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04367)| In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring the integrity and security of data is paramount. This study delves into the security aspects of Merkle Trees, a fundamental component in blockchain architectures, such as Ethereum. We critically examine the susceptibility of Merkle Trees to hash collisions, a potential vulnerability that poses significant risks to data security within blockchain systems. Despite their widespread application, the collision resistance of Merkle Trees and their robustness against preimage attacks have not been thoroughly investigated, leading to a notable gap in the comprehensive understanding of blockchain security mechanisms. Our research endeavors to bridge this gap through a meticulous blend of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. We scrutinize the probability of root collisions in Merkle Trees, considering various factors such as hash length and path length within the tree. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the increase in path length and the heightened probability of root collisions, thereby underscoring potential security vulnerabilities. Conversely, we observe that an increase in hash length significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions, highlighting its critical role in fortifying security. The insights garnered from our research offer valuable guidance for blockchain developers and researchers, aiming to bolster the security and operational efficacy of blockchain-based systems. |

We summarize the features of CEXs and DEXs and propose 4 exchange models that govern the operations of exchanges in different type, allowing for the classification of any exchange into one of these predefined models. Our research also includes an empirical analysis of traders' behavior in exchanges of the 4 types of models. On DEX of Virtual Automated Market Making (VAMM) Model, open interest on short and long positions exert effect on price volatility in opposite direction, attributable to VAMM's price formation mechanism. In the DEXs with Oracle Pricing Model, we observed a distinct asymmetry in trader behavior between buyers and sellers. Such asymmetry might stem from uninformed traders reacting more strongly to positive news than to negative, leading to a tendency to accumulate long positions. This study sheds light on the potential risks and advantages of using perpetual future contracts within the DeFi space while provides mathematical basis and empirical insights based on which future theoretical works can be configurated, offering crucial insights into the rapidly evolving world of blockchain-based financial instruments. |
|**2024-02-06**|**Aperiodic two-layer energy management system for community microgrids based on blockchain strategy**|Miguel Gayo Abeleira et.al.|[2402.03880](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03880)| This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal. |

However, the current approaches to data verification in blockchain systems, particularly in Ethereum, face challenges in terms of efficiency and computational overhead. The traditional use of Merkle Trees and cryptographic hash functions, while effective, leads to significant resource consumption, especially for large datasets. This highlights a gap in existing research: the need for more efficient methods of data verification in blockchain networks. Our study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative aggregation scheme for Zero-Knowledge Proofs within the structure of Merkle Trees. We develop a system that significantly reduces the size of the proof and the computational resources needed for its generation and verification. Our approach represents a paradigm shift in blockchain data verification, balancing security with efficiency. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using real Ethereum block data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate a drastic reduction in proof size and computational requirements compared to traditional methods, making the verification process more efficient and economically viable. Our contribution fills a critical research void, offering a scalable and secure solution for blockchain data verification. The implications of our work are far-reaching, enhancing the overall performance and adaptability of blockchain technology in various applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management. |

By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents within a multi-agent system, these systems can tackle complex tasks through collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems. We also explore the potential application of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application in real-world distributed systems. |
|**2024-02-05**|**A security framework for Ethereum smart contracts**|Antonio López Vivar et.al.|[2402.03555](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03555)| The use of blockchain and smart contracts have not stopped growing in recent years. Like all software that begins to expand its use, it is also beginning to be targeted by hackers who will try to exploit vulnerabilities in both the underlying technology and the smart contract code itself. While many tools already exist for analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the heterogeneity and variety of approaches and differences in providing the analysis data makes the learning curve for the smart contract developer steep. In this article the authors present ESAF (Ethereum Security Analysis Framework), a framework for analysis of smart contracts that aims to unify and facilitate the task of analyzing smart contract vulnerabilities which can be used as a persistent security monitoring tool for a set of target contracts as well as a classic vulnerability analysis tool among other uses. |

Gabbay et.al.|[2402.03253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03253)| We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open.   The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing.   This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems. |
|**2024-06-19**|**Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation**|Lei Yang et.al.|[2402.02668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02668)| Set reconciliation, where two parties hold fixed-length bit strings and run a protocol to learn the strings they are missing from each other, is a fundamental task in many distributed systems. We present Rateless Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (Rateless IBLT), the first set reconciliation protocol, to the best of our knowledge, that achieves low computation cost and near-optimal communication cost across a wide range of scenarios: set differences of one to millions, bit strings of a few bytes to megabytes, and workloads injected by potential adversaries. Rateless IBLT is based on a novel encoder that incrementally encodes the set difference into an infinite stream of coded symbols, resembling rateless error-correcting codes. We compare Rateless IBLT with state-of-the-art set reconciliation schemes and demonstrate significant improvements. Rateless IBLT achieves 3--4x lower communication cost than non-rateless schemes with similar computation cost, and 2--2000x lower computation cost than schemes with similar communication cost. We show the real-world benefits of Rateless IBLT by applying it to synchronize the state of the Ethereum blockchain, and demonstrate 5.6x lower end-to-end completion time and 4.4x lower communication cost compared to the system used in production. |

While previous studies have posited a prohibitive cost for such attacks, we show that this cost may be dramatically reduced (to approximately \$125), thereby increasing the likelihood of these attacks. To this end, we introduce Bribe & Fork, a modified bribing attack that leverages the threat of a so-called feather fork which we analyze with a novel formal model for the mining game with forking. We empirically analyze historical data of some real-world blockchain implementations to evaluate the scale of this cost reduction. Our findings shed more light on the potential vulnerability of PCNs and highlight the need for robust solutions. |

Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems or augmented reality. One of the latest technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain, which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability, accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges. Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it. Finally, after a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry developments. |
|**2024-02-01**|**Towards post-quantum blockchain: A review on blockchain cryptography resistant to quantum computing attacks**|Tiago M. Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00922)| Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency, redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges. Furthermore, extensive comparisons are provided on the characteristics and performance of the most promising post-quantum public-key encryption and digital signature schemes for blockchains. Thus, this article seeks to provide a broad view and useful guidelines on post-quantum blockchain security to future blockchain researchers and developers. |

Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00709)| In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios. |
|**2024-02-01**|**A Review on the Use of Blockchain for the Internet of Things**|Tiago M. Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00687)| The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications. |
|**2024-05-26**|**A Circuit Approach to Constructing Blockchains on Blockchains**|Ertem Nusret Tas et.al.|[2402.00220](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00220)| Since the creation of Bitcoin 15 years ago, there has been an explosion in the number of permissionless blockchains. Each of these blockchains provides an open ledger that anyone can read from and write to. In this multi-chain world, an important question emerges: how can we build a more secure overlay blockchain by reading from and writing to a given set of blockchains? Drawing an analogy with switching circuits, we approach the problem by defining two basic compositional operations between blockchains, serial and triangular compositions, and use these operations as building blocks to construct general overlay blockchains. Under the partially synchronous setting, we have the following results: 1) the serial composition, between two blockchains, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if at least one of the two underlay blockchains is safe and that is live if both underlay blockchains are live; 2) the triangular composition between three blockchains, akin to parallel composition of switching circuits, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if all underlay blockchains are safe and that is live if at least half of them are live; 3) repeated composition of these two basic operations can yield all possible tradeoffs of safety and liveness for an overlay blockchain built on arbitrary number of underlay chains. The results are also extended to the synchronous setting. |

This report presents a primary exploration of Bitcoin inscriptions.

|**2024-01-25**|**Decentralized Federated Learning: A Survey on Security and Privacy**|Ehsan Hallaji et.al.|[2401.17319](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17319)| Federated learning has been rapidly evolving and gaining popularity in recent years due to its privacy-preserving features, among other advantages. Nevertheless, the exchange of model updates and gradients in this architecture provides new attack surfaces for malicious users of the network which may jeopardize the model performance and user and data privacy. For this reason, one of the main motivations for decentralized federated learning is to eliminate server-related threats by removing the server from the network and compensating for it through technologies such as blockchain. However, this advantage comes at the cost of challenging the system with new privacy threats. Thus, performing a thorough security analysis in this new paradigm is necessary. This survey studies possible variations of threats and adversaries in decentralized federated learning and overviews the potential defense mechanisms. Trustability and verifiability of decentralized federated learning are also considered in this study. |
|**2024-01-30**|**Quantum-Secure Hybrid Blockchain System for DID-based Verifiable Random Function with NTRU Linkable Ring Signature**|Bong Gon Kim et.al.|[2401.16906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16906)| In this study, we present a secure smart contract-based Verifiable Random Function (VRF) model, addressing the shortcomings of existing systems. As quantum computing emerges, conventional public key cryptography faces potential vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's robustness, we employ post-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for generating pseudo-random sequences. Given the computational intensity of this approach and associated on-chain gas costs, we propose a hybrid architecture of VRF system where on-chain and off-chain can communicate in a scalable and secure way. To ensure the validity and integrity of the off-chain computations (e.g., Ring-LWE encryption), we employ a quantum-secure linkable ring signature scheme on NTRU lattice and also delegated key generation (DKG) with a secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). Our decentralized VRF employs multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), ensuring the collective efforts of enhanced randomness and security. We show the security and privacy advantages of our proposed VRF model with the approximated estimation of overall temporal and spatial complexities. We also evaluate our VRF MPC model's entropy and outline its Solidity smart contract integration. This research also provides a method to produce and verify the VRF output's proof, optimal for scenarios necessitating randomness and validation. Lastly, using NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the commendable result with a 97.73% overall pass rate on 11 standard tests and 0.5459 of average p-value for the total 176 tests. |
|**2024-01-31**|**BAR Nash Equilibrium and Application to Blockchain Design**|Maxime Reynouard et.al.|[2401.16856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16856)| This paper presents a novel solution concept, called BAR Nash Equilibrium (BARNE) and apply it to analyse the Verifier's dilemma, a fundamental problem in blockchain. Our solution concept adapts the Nash equilibrium (NE) to accommodate interactions among Byzantine, altruistic and rational agents, which became known as the BAR setting in the literature. We prove the existence of BARNE in a large class of games and introduce two natural refinements, global and local stability. Using this equilibrium and its refinement, we analyse the free-rider problem in the context of byzantine consensus. We demonstrate that by incorporating fines and forced errors into a standard quorum-based blockchain protocol, we can effectively reestablish honest behavior as a globally stable BARNE. |
|**2024-05-29**|**Game of Coding: Beyond Trusted Majorities**|Hanzaleh Akbari Nodehi et.al.|[2401.16643](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16643)| Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversary and the data collector (decoder) have a utility function to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2, for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions. |
|**2024-01-29**|**Empirical and Theoretical Analysis of Liquid Staking Protocols**|Krzysztof Gogol et.al.|[2401.16353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16353)| Liquid staking has become the largest category of decentralized finance protocols in terms of total value locked. However, few studies exist on its implementation designs or underlying risks. The liquid staking protocols allow for earning staking rewards without the disadvantage of locking the capital at the validators. Yet, they are seen by some as a threat to the Proof-of-Stake blockchain security.   This paper is the first work that classifies liquid staking implementations. It analyzes the historical performance of major liquid staking tokens in comparison to the traditional staking for the largest Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Furthermore, the research investigates the impact of centralization, maximum extractable value and the migration of Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake on the tokens' performance. Examining the tracking error of the liquid stacking providers to the staking rewards shows that they are persistent and cannot be explained by macro-variables of the currency, such as the variance or return. |
|**2024-01-29**|**S-HIDRA: A blockchain and SDN domain-based architecture to orchestrate fog computing environments**|carlos Núñez-Gómez et.al.|[2401.16341](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16341)| Fog computing arises as a complement to cloud computing where computing and storage are provided in a decentralized way rather than the centralized approach of the cloud paradigm. In addition, blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger which can provide support for running arbitrary logic thanks to smart contracts. These facts can lead to harness smart contracts on blockchain as the basis for a decentralized, autonomous, and resilient orchestrator for the resources in the fog. However, the potentially vast amount of geographically distributed fog nodes may threaten the feasibility of the orchestration. On the other hand, fog nodes can exhibit highly dynamic workloads which may result in the orchestrator redistributing the services among them. Thus, there is also a need to dynamically support the network connections to those services independently of their location. Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be integrated within the orchestrator to carry out a seamless service management. To tackle both aforementioned issues, the S-HIDRA architecture is proposed. It integrates SDN support within a blockchain-based orchestrator of container-based services for fog environments, in order to provide low network latency and high service availability. Also, a domain-based architecture is outlined \marev{as potential scenario} to address the geographic distributed nature of fog environments. Results obtained from a proof-of-concept implementation assess the required functionality for S-HIDRA. |
|**2024-02-16**|**Pilotfish: Distributed Transaction Execution for Lazy Blockchains**|Quentin Kniep et.al.|[2401.16292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16292)| Pilotfish is the first scale-out blockchain execution engine able to harness any degree of parallelizability existing in its workload. Pilotfish allows each validator to employ multiple machines, named ExecutionWorkers, under its control to scale its execution layer. Given a sufficiently parallelizable and compute-intensive load, the number of transactions that the validator can execute increases linearly with the number of ExecutionWorkers at its disposal. In addition, Pilotfish maintains the consistency of the state, even when many validators experience simultaneous machine failures. This is possible due to the meticulous co-design of our crash-recovery protocol which leverages the existing fault tolerance in the blockchain's consensus mechanism. Finally, Pilotfish can also be seen as the first distributed deterministic execution engine that provides support for dynamic reads as transactions are not required to provide a fully accurate read and write set. This loosening of requirements would normally reduce the parallelizability available by blocking write-after-write conflicts, but our novel versioned-queues scheduling algorithm circumvents this by exploiting the lazy recovery property of Pilotfish, which only persists consistent state and re-executes any optimistic steps taken before the crash. In order to prove our claims we implemented the common path of Pilotfish with support for the MoveVM and evaluated it against the parallel execution MoveVM of Sui. Our results show that Pilotfish provides good scalability up to 8 ExecutionWorkers for a variety of workloads. In computationally-heavy workloads, Pilotfish's scalability is linear. |

Alcaide et.al.|[2401.16028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16028)| In Spain, quantity surveyors are entitled to carry out official cadastral surveys, attestations, and certificate issuing according to a well-defined professional code. Official Associations of Quantity Surveyors and Technical Architects (COAAT) are responsible for endorsing the documentation related to actions performed on buildings. An e-platform that enables immutability, traceability, and a unique property record among all the Spanish COAATs, with an affordable cost, is essential to streamline the involved processes.   The blockchain technology and smart contracts have recently emerged as promising solutions for e-government services due to the inherent features provided by the technology. In this paper, we identify the design goals and propose a blockchain-based e-government system for the electronic management of the documentation generated, submitted, and validated by the Spanish COAATs, namely, the COAATChain. The proposal has been deployed and evaluated on the Binance testnet blockchain, in order to assess its affordability. |
|**2024-01-29**|**Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Federated Unlearning**|Yijing Lin et.al.|[2401.15917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15917)| Federated unlearning is a promising paradigm for protecting the data ownership of distributed clients. It allows central servers to remove historical data effects within the machine learning model as well as address the "right to be forgotten" issue in federated learning. However, existing works require central servers to retain the historical model parameters from distributed clients, such that allows the central server to utilize these parameters for further training even, after the clients exit the training process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new blockchain-enabled trustworthy federated unlearning framework. We first design a proof of federated unlearning protocol, which utilizes the Chameleon hash function to verify data removal and eliminate the data contributions stored in other clients' models. Then, an adaptive contribution-based retraining mechanism is developed to reduce the computational overhead and significantly improve the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a better data removal effect than the state-of-the-art frameworks, marking a significant stride towards trustworthy federated unlearning. |

Among the disruptive forces, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain technology stand out prominently. This study aims to evaluate the integration of blockchain, AI, and ML within financial accounting practices. It suggests a potential revolutionary impact on financial accounting through the adoption of blockchain technology and ML, promising reduced accounting expenses, heightened precision, real-time financial reporting capabilities, and expeditious auditing processes. AI's role in automating repetitive financial accounting tasks assists organizations in circumventing the need for additional staff, thereby minimizing associated costs. Consequently, to bolster efficiency, businesses are increasingly embracing blockchain technology and AI applications in their financial accounting operations. |

Nguyen et.al.|[2401.15625](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15625)| Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address critical challenges of blockchain technology, including scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems. |
|**2024-01-31**|**Unsealing the secrets of blockchain consensus: A systematic comparison of the formal security of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake**|Iván Abellán Álvarez et.al.|[2401.14527](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14527)| With the increasing adoption of decentralized information systems based on a variety of permissionless blockchain networks, the choice of consensus mechanism is at the core of many controversial discussions. Ethereum's recent transition from (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS)-based consensus has further fueled the debate on which mechanism is more favorable. While the aspects of energy consumption and degree of (de-)centralization are often emphasized in the public discourse, seminal research has also shed light on the formal security aspects of both approaches individually. However, related work has not yet comprehensively structured the knowledge about the security properties of PoW and PoS. Rather, it has focused on in-depth analyses of specific protocols or high-level comparative reviews covering a broad range of consensus mechanisms. To fill this gap and unravel the commonalities and discrepancies between the formal security properties of PoW- and PoS-based consensus, we conduct a systematic literature review over 26 research articles. Our findings indicate that PoW-based consensus with the longest chain rule provides the strongest formal security guarantees. Nonetheless, PoS can achieve similar guarantees when addressing its more pronounced tradeoff between safety and liveness through hybrid approaches. |

Although Web 3.0 is undoubtedly an essential component of the future Internet, it currently faces critical challenges, including decentralized data collection and management. To overcome these challenges, blockchain has emerged as one of the core technologies for the future development of Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based information management framework, namely Smart Blockchain-based Web, to manage information in Web 3.0 effectively, enhance the security and privacy of users data, bring additional profits, and incentivize users to contribute information to the websites. Particularly, SBW utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage the decentralized data collection process for Web 3.0 effectively. Moreover, in this framework, we develop an effective consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Stake to reward the user's information contribution and conduct game theoretical analysis to analyze the users behavior in the considered system. Additionally, we conduct simulations to assess the performance of SBW and investigate the impact of critical parameters on information contribution. The findings confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our proposed consensus mechanism can incentivize the nodes and users to contribute more information to our systems. |
|**2024-01-31**|**CHIRON: Accelerating Node Synchronization without Security Trade-offs in Distributed Ledgers**|Ray Neiheiser et.al.|[2401.14278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14278)| Blockchain performance has historically faced challenges posed by the throughput limitations of consensus algorithms. Recent breakthroughs in research have successfully alleviated these constraints by introducing a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution. The move toward independent optimization of the consensus layer has shifted attention to the execution layer.   While concurrent transaction execution is a promising solution for increasing throughput, practical challenges persist. Its effectiveness varies based on the workloads, and the associated increased hardware requirements raise concerns about undesirable centralization. This increased requirement results in full nodes and stragglers synchronizing from signed checkpoints, decreasing the trustless nature of blockchain systems.   In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Chiron, a system designed to extract execution hints for the acceleration of straggling and full nodes. Notably, Chiron achieves this without compromising the security of the system or introducing overhead on the critical path of consensus. Evaluation results demonstrate a notable speedup of up to 30%, effectively addressing the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment. The quantification of this speedup is achieved through realistic blockchain benchmarks derived from a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum and Solana workloads, constituting an independent contribution. |
|**2024-01-24**|**Enabling Seamless Data Security, Consensus, and Trading in Vehicular Networks**|Emanuel Vieira et.al.|[2401.13630](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13630)| Cooperative driving is an emerging paradigm to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. To ensure successful cooperation, road users must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore, vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or misbehaving nodes, while also considering inherent constraints of the wireless medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading with minimal overhead. To achieve this, we employ blockchain techniques, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based mechanics. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the VEE extension in overcoming the challenges posed by the distributed and opportunistic nature of wireless vehicular communications. |

However, risk management frameworks, including regulatory ones, have been largely absent. In this paper, we address the critical question of measuring and managing risk in stablecoin protocols, which operate on public blockchain infrastructure. The on-chain environment makes it possible to monitor risk and automate its management via transparent smart-contracts in real-time. We propose two risk metrics covering capitalization and liquidity of stablecoin protocols. We then explore in a case-study type analysis how our risk management framework can be applied to DAI, the biggest decentralized stablecoin by market capitalisation to-date, governed by MakerDAO. Based on our findings, we recommend that the protocol explores implementing automatic capital buffer adjustments and dynamic maturity gap matching. Our analysis demonstrates the practical benefits for scalable (prudential) risk management stemming from real-time availability of high-quality, granular, tamper-resistant on-chain data in the digital asset space. We name this approach Crypto Asset-Liability Management (CALM). |
|**2024-01-24**|**Designing Redistribution Mechanisms for Reducing Transaction Fees in Blockchains**|Sankarshan Damle et.al.|[2401.13262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13262)| Blockchains deploy Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to determine which user transactions to include in blocks and determine their payments (i.e., transaction fees). Increasing demand and scarce block resources have led to high user transaction fees. As these blockchains are a public resource, it may be preferable to reduce these transaction fees. To this end, we introduce Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs) -- redistributing VCG payments collected from such TFM as rebates to minimize transaction fees. Classic redistribution mechanisms (RMs) achieve this while ensuring Allocative Efficiency (AE) and User Incentive Compatibility (UIC). Our first result shows the non-triviality of applying RM in TFMs. More concretely, we prove that it is impossible to reduce transaction fees when (i) transactions that are not confirmed do not receive rebates and (ii) the miner can strategically manipulate the mechanism. Driven by this, we propose \emph{Robust} TFRM (\textsf{R-TFRM}): a mechanism that compromises on an honest miner's individual rationality to guarantee strictly positive rebates to the users. We then introduce \emph{robust} and \emph{rational} TFRM (\textsf{R} $^2$ \textsf{-TFRM}) that uses trusted on-chain randomness that additionally guarantees miner's individual rationality (in expectation) and strictly positive rebates. Our results show that TFRMs provide a promising new direction for reducing transaction fees in public blockchains. |
|**2024-01-24**|**Time-Aware Knowledge Representations of Dynamic Objects with Multidimensional Persistence**|Baris Coskunuzer et.al.|[2401.13157](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13157)| Learning time-evolving objects such as multivariate time series and dynamic networks requires the development of novel knowledge representation mechanisms and neural network architectures, which allow for capturing implicit time-dependent information contained in the data. Such information is typically not directly observed but plays a key role in the learning task performance. In turn, lack of time dimension in knowledge encoding mechanisms for time-dependent data leads to frequent model updates, poor learning performance, and, as a result, subpar decision-making. Here we propose a new approach to a time-aware knowledge representation mechanism that notably focuses on implicit time-dependent topological information along multiple geometric dimensions. In particular, we propose a new approach, named \textit{Temporal MultiPersistence} (TMP), which produces multidimensional topological fingerprints of the data by using the existing single parameter topological summaries. The main idea behind TMP is to merge the two newest directions in topological representation learning, that is, multi-persistence which simultaneously describes data shape evolution along multiple key parameters, and zigzag persistence to enable us to extract the most salient data shape information over time. We derive theoretical guarantees of TMP vectorizations and show its utility, in application to forecasting on benchmark traffic flow, Ethereum blockchain, and electrocardiogram datasets, demonstrating the competitive performance, especially, in scenarios of limited data records. In addition, our TMP method improves the computational efficiency of the state-of-the-art multipersistence summaries up to 59.5 times. |
|**2024-01-22**|**Monitoring the Future of Smart Contracts**|Margarita Capretto et.al.|[2401.12093](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12093)| Blockchains are decentralized systems that provide trustable execution guarantees. Smart contracts are programs written in specialized programming languages running on blockchains that govern how tokens and cryptocurrency are sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke other smart contracts during the execution of transactions always initiated by external users.   Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified, so techniques like runtime verification are very appealing for improving their reliability. However, the conventional model of computation of smart contracts is transactional: once operations commit, their effects are permanent and cannot be undone.   In this paper, we proposed the concept of future monitors which allows monitors to remain waiting for future transactions to occur before committing or aborting. This is inspired by optimistic rollups, which are modern blockchain implementations that increase efficiency (and reduce cost) by delaying transaction effects. We exploit this delay to propose a model of computation that allows (bounded) future monitors. We show our monitors correct respect of legacy transactions, how they implement future bounded monitors and how they guarantee progress. We illustrate the use of future bounded monitors to implement correctly multi-transaction flash loans. |

Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about the motivations of donors in these charity fundraisers, resulting in a negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity, based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of strategic generosity), and based on an individual's degree of social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT "relisters" experience significant penalties in the market, in terms of the prices they are able to command on other NFT listings, particularly among those who relist quickly and those who are more socially exposed. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly. |

This family exhibits two interesting benefits, if used as a platform for large-scale, instant, retail payment systems, such as CBDCs: Technically, the solution offers state-of-the-art guarantees of fault-tolerance and integrity, while providing a latency and throughput comparable to centralized systems; from a business perspective, the solution perfectly suits the 3-tier architecture of the current banking ecosystem (central banks / commercial banks / retail users), assigning a pivotal and peculiar role to the members of each tier. Furthermore, the cryptographic privacy of payments for retail users -- typical of PCNs such as the public Lightning Network -- is largely (possibly fully) retained. We study the system by simulating a scaled-down version of a hypothetical European CBDC, exploring the trade-offs among liquidity locked by market operators, payment success rate, throughput, latency, and load on the underpinning blockchain. |

Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications.   We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to \textit{sign using their existing OpenID accounts} and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts.   zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. By design, zkLogin builds on top of the underlying platform's authentication mechanisms, and derives its security from there. Unlike prior related works however, zkLogin avoids the use of additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles) for its security guarantees. zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.   We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, without requiring mnemonics, many hundreds of thousands zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, ride sharing, sports racing and many more. |

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study that uncovers unfair trades on popular DEX services on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By joining and analyzing 60 million transactions, we find 671,400 unfair trades on all six measured DEXes, including Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve. Out of these unfair trades, we attribute 55,000 instances, with high confidence, to token thefts that cause a value loss of more than 3.88 million USD. Furthermore, the measurement study uncovers previously unknown causes of extractable value and real-world adaptive strategies to these causes. Finally, we propose countermeasures to redesign secure DEX protocols and to harden deployed services against the discovered security risks. |

However, vulnerabilities in this mission-critical code have led to significant exploitations and asset losses. Thorough automated security analysis of smart contracts is thus imperative. This paper introduces LLM4Fuzz to optimize automated smart contract security analysis by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to intelligently guide and prioritize fuzzing campaigns. While traditional fuzzing suffers from low efficiency in exploring the vast state space, LLM4Fuzz employs LLMs to direct fuzzers towards high-value code regions and input sequences more likely to trigger vulnerabilities. Additionally, LLM4Fuzz can leverage LLMs to guide fuzzers based on user-defined invariants, reducing blind exploration overhead. Evaluations of LLM4Fuzz on real-world DeFi projects show substantial gains in efficiency, coverage, and vulnerability detection compared to baseline fuzzing. LLM4Fuzz also uncovered five critical vulnerabilities that can lead to a loss of more than $247k. |

Depending on individual interests, wallets explore and purchase NFTs in one or more image collections. Among many potential factors of shaping purchase trajectories, this paper specifically examines how visual similarities between collections affect wallets' explorations. Our model shows that wallets' explorations are not random but tend to favor collections having similar visual features to their previous purchases. The model also predicts the extent to which the next collection is close to the most recent collection of purchases with respect to visual features. These results are expected to enhance and support recommendation systems for the NFT market. |

Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the present supply chain market today includes various companies involving integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority, intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and IoT. |
|**2024-01-17**|**A Blockchain-based Model for Securing Data Pipeline in a Heterogeneous Information System**|MN Ramahlosi et.al.|[2401.09240](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09240)| In our digital world, access to personal and public data has become an item of concern, with challenging security and privacy aspects. Modern information systems are heterogeneous in nature and have an inherent security vulnerability, which is susceptible to data interception and data modification due to unsecured communication data pipelines between connected endpoints. This re-search article presents a blockchain-based model for securing data pipelines in a heterogeneous information system using an integrated multi-hazard early warning system (MHEWS) as a case study. The proposed model utilizes the inherent security features of blockchain technology to address the security and privacy concerns that arise in data pipelines. The model is designed to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in a decentralized manner. The model is evaluated in a hybrid environment using a prototype implementation and simulation experiments with outcomes that demonstrate advantages over traditional approaches for a tamper-proof and immutable data pipeline for data authenticity and integrity using a confidential ledger. |

This gap underlines the pressing necessity for a protocol that not only enables seamless cross-platform messaging but also allows direct messaging to wallet addresses, fostering interoperability and privacy across diverse platforms. SendingNetwork addresses this need by creating a reliable and secure decentralized communication network, targeting essential challenges like privacy protection, scalability, efficiency, and composability. Central to our approach is the incorporation of edge computing to form an adaptive relay network with the modular libp2p library. We introduce a dynamic group chat encryption mechanism based on the Double Ratchet algorithm for secure communication and propose a Delegation scheme for efficient message processing in large group chats, enhancing both resilience and scalability. Our theoretical analyses affirm the Delegation scheme's superior performance. To bolster system stability and encourage node participation, we integrate two innovative consensus mechanisms: "Proof of Relay" for validating message relay workload based on the novel KZG commitment, and "Proof of Availability" for ensuring network consistency and managing incentives through Verkle trees. Our whitepaper details the network's key components and architecture, concluding with a roadmap and a preview of future enhancements to SendingNetwork. |
|**2024-01-17**|**DECENT-BRM: Decentralization through Block Reward Mechanisms**|Varul Srivastava et.al.|[2401.08988](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08988)| Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm where miners solve cryptographic puzzles to mine blocks and obtain a reward through some Block Reward Mechanism (BRM). PoW blockchain faces the problem of centralization due to the formation of mining pools, where miners mine blocks as a group and distribute rewards. The rationale is to reduce the risk (variance) in reward while obtaining the same expected block reward. In this work, we address the problem of centralization due to mining pools in PoW blockchain. We propose a two-player game between the new miner joining the system and the PoW blockchain system.   We model the utility for the incoming miner as a combination of (i) expected block reward, (ii) risk, and (iii) cost of switching between different mining pools. With this utility structure, we analyze the equilibrium strategy of the incoming miner for different BRMs: (a) memoryless -- block reward is history independent (e.g., Bitcoin) (b) retentive: block reward is history-dependent (e.g., Fruitchains). For memoryless BRMs, we show that depending on the coefficient of switching cost $c$, the protocol is decentralized when $c = 0$ and centralized when $c > \underline{c}$ . In addition, we show the impossibility of constructing a memoryless BRM where solo mining gives a higher payoff than forming/joining mining pools. While retentive BRM in Fruitchains reduces risk in solo mining, the equilibrium strategy for incoming miners is still to join mining pools, leading to centralization. We then propose our novel retentive BRM -- \textsf{Decent-BRM}. We show that under \textsf{Decent-BRM}, incoming miners obtain higher utility in solo mining than joining mining pools. Therefore, no mining pools are formed, and the Pow blockchain using \textsf{Decent-BRM} is decentralized. |
|**2024-01-17**|**An Efficient and Scalable Auditing Scheme for Cloud Data Storage using an Enhanced B-tree**|Tariqul Islam et.al.|[2401.08953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08953)| An efficient, scalable, and provably secure dynamic auditing scheme is highly desirable in the cloud storage environment for verifying the integrity of the outsourced data. Most of the existing work on remote integrity checking focuses on static archival data and therefore cannot be applied to cases where dynamic data updates are more common. Additionally, existing auditing schemes suffer from performance bottlenecks and scalability issues. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel dynamic auditing scheme for centralized cloud environments leveraging an enhanced version of the B-tree. Our proposed scheme achieves the immutable characteristic of a decentralized system (i.e., blockchain technology) while effectively addressing the synchronization and performance challenges of such systems. Unlike other static auditing schemes, our scheme supports dynamic insert, update, and delete operations. Also, by leveraging an enhanced B-tree, our scheme maintains a balanced tree after any alteration to a certain file, improving performance significantly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms both traditional Merkle Hash Tree-based centralized auditing and decentralized blockchain-based auditing schemes in terms of block modifications (e.g., insert, delete, update), block retrieval, and data verification time. |
|**2024-01-16**|**Do backrun auctions protect traders?**|Andrew W. Macpherson et.al.|[2401.08302](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08302)| We study a new "laminated" queueing model for orders on batched trading venues such as decentralised exchanges. The model aims to capture and generalise transaction queueing infrastructure that has arisen to organise MEV activity on public blockchains such as Ethereum, providing convenient channels for sophisticated agents to extract value by acting on end-user order flow by performing arbitrage and related HFT activities. In our model, market orders are interspersed with orders created by arbitrageurs that under idealised conditions reset the marginal price to a global equilibrium between each trade, improving predictability of execution for liquidity traders.   If an arbitrageur has a chance to land multiple opportunities in a row, he may attempt to manipulate the execution price of the intervening market order by a probabilistic blind sandwiching strategy. To study how bad this manipulation can get, we introduce and bound a price manipulation coefficient that measures the deviation from global equilibrium of local pricing quoted by a rational arbitrageur. We exhibit cases in which this coefficient is well approximated by a "zeta value' with interpretable and empirically measurable parameters. |
|**2024-01-15**|**Playing the MEV Game on a First-Come-First-Served Blockchain**|Burak Öz et.al.|[2401.07992](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07992)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) searching has gained prominence on the Ethereum blockchain since the surge in Decentralized Finance activities. In Ethereum, MEV extraction primarily hinges on fee payments to block proposers. However, in First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) blockchain networks, the focus shifts to latency optimizations, akin to High-Frequency Trading in Traditional Finance. This paper illustrates the dynamics of the MEV extraction game in an FCFS network, specifically Algorand. We introduce an arbitrage detection algorithm tailored to the unique time constraints of FCFS networks and assess its effectiveness. Additionally, our experiments investigate potential optimizations in Algorand's network layer to secure optimal execution positions.   Our analysis reveals that while the states of relevant trading pools are updated approximately every six blocks on median, pursuing MEV at the block state level is not viable on Algorand, as arbitrage opportunities are typically executed within the blocks they appear. Our algorithm's performance under varying time constraints underscores the importance of timing in arbitrage discovery. Furthermore, our network-level experiments identify critical transaction prioritization strategies for Algorand's FCFS network. Key among these is reducing latency in connections with relays that are well-connected to high-staked proposers. |

This paper thoroughly compares and analyzes two blockchain-based decentralized storage networks (DSNs), which are crucial foundations for DApp and blockchain ecosystems. The study examines their respective mechanisms for data persistence, strategies for enforcing data retention, and token economics. In addition to delving into technical details, the suitability of each storage solution for decentralized application development is assessed, taking into consideration network performance, storage costs, and existing use cases. By evaluating these factors, the paper aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these technologies in supporting the desirable properties of truly decentralized blockchain applications. In conclusion, the findings of this research are discussed and synthesized, offering valuable perspectives on the capabilities of these technologies. It sheds light on their potential to facilitate the development of DApps and provides an understanding of the ongoing trends in blockchain development. |
|**2024-02-02**|**LookAhead: Preventing DeFi Attacks via Unveiling Adversarial Contracts**|Shoupeng Ren et.al.|[2401.07261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07261)| DeFi incidents stemming from various smart contract vulnerabilities have culminated in financial damages exceeding 3 billion USD. The attacks causing such incidents commonly commence with the deployment of adversarial contracts, subsequently leveraging these contracts to execute adversarial transactions that exploit vulnerabilities in victim contracts. Existing defense mechanisms leverage heuristic or machine learning algorithms to detect adversarial transactions, but they face significant challenges in detecting private adversarial transactions. Namely, attackers can send adversarial transactions directly to miners, evading visibility within the blockchain network and effectively bypassing the detection. In this paper, we propose a new direction for detecting DeFi attacks, i.e., detecting adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions, allowing us to proactively identify potential attack intentions, even if they employ private adversarial transactions. Specifically, we observe that most adversarial contracts follow a similar pattern, e.g., anonymous fund source, closed-source, frequent token-related function calls. Based on this observation, we build a machine learning classifier that can effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones. We build a dataset consists of features extracted from 269 adversarial contracts and 13,000 benign contracts. Based on this dataset, we evaluate different classifiers, the results of which show that our method for identifying DeFi adversarial contracts performs exceptionally well. For example, the F1-Score for LightGBM-based classifier is 0.9541, with a remarkably low false positive rate of only 0.15%. |

In particular, the recently proposed Streamlet protocol provides a surprisingly simple and streamlined consensus approach, which crystallizes years of research in simplifying and improving classical consensus protocols. While the simplicity of Streamlet is a major accomplishment, the protocol lacks certain practical features, such as supporting a stable block proposer, and it makes strong assumptions, such as synchronized clocks and the implicit echoing of all messages. Most importantly, it requires sending $O(N^3)$ messages per block in a network of $N$ nodes, which poses a significant challenge to its application in larger networks. To address these limitations, we introduce Pipelet, a practical streamlined consensus protocol. Pipelet employs the same block-finalization rule as Streamlet, but attains state-of-the-art performance in terms of communication complexity and provides features that are crucial for practical applications, such as clock synchronization and stable block proposers. At the same time, Pipelet retains the simplicity of Streamlet, which presents significant practical advantages, such as ease of implementation and verification. |

Blockchain-based Time Machines for Decentralized Reveal of Locked Information**|Zhuolun Li et.al.|[2401.05947](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05947)| Conditional information reveal systems automate the release of information upon meeting specific predefined conditions, such as time or location. This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a verifiable secret sharing scheme, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that `sends messages in the future' with highly accurate decryption times. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe. Using real-world election data, we also demonstrate the applicability of this innovative system in e-voting, illustrating its capacity to secure and ensure fair electronic voting processes. |
|**2024-01-11**|**STAKESURE: Proof of Stake Mechanisms with Strong Cryptoeconomic Safety**|Soubhik Deb et.al.|[2401.05797](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05797)| As of July 15, 2023, Ethererum, which is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain [1] has around 410 Billion USD in total assets on chain (popularly referred to as total-value-locked, TVL) but has only 33 Billion USD worth of ETH staked in securing the underlying consensus of the chain [2]. A preliminary analysis might suggest that as the amount staked is far less (11x less) than the value secured, the Ethereum blockchain is insecure and "over-leveraged" in a purely cryptoeconomic sense. In this work, we investigate how Ethereum, or, more generally, any PoS blockchain can be made secure despite this apparent imbalance. Towards that end, we attempt to formalize a model for analyzing the cryptoeconomic safety of PoS blockchain, which separately analyzes the cost-of-corruption, the cost incurred by an attacker, and the profit-from-corruption, the profit gained by an attacker. We derive sharper bounds on profit-from-corruption, as well as new confirmation rules that significantly decrease this upper-bound. We evaluate cost-of-corruption and profit-from-corruption only from the perspective of attacking safety. Finally, we present a new "insurance" mechanism, STAKESURE, for allocating the slashed funds in a PoS system, that has several highly desirable properties: solving common information problem in existing blockchains, creating a mechanism for provably safe bridging, and providing the first sharp solution for automatically adjusting how much economic security is sufficient in a PoS system. Finally, we show that the system satisfies a notion of strong cryptoeconomic safety, which guarantees that no honest transactor ever loses money, and creates a closed system of Karma, which not only ensures that the attacker suffers a loss of funds but also that the harmed parties are sufficiently compensated. |

We also report significant sample-to-sample variations of the distribution of holding times, which can be best characterized as multiscaling, with power-law exponents varying between $0.3$ and $2.5$ depending on bitcoin price regimes. We document significant differences between the distributions of book-to-market and of realized returns, showing that traders obtain far from optimal performance. We also report strong direct qualitative and quantitative evidence of the disposition effect in the Bitcoin Blockchain data. Defining age-dependent transaction flows as the fraction of bitcoins that are traded at a given time and that were born (last traded) at some specific earlier time, we document that the time-averaged transaction flow fraction has a power law dependence as a function of age, with an exponent close to $-1.5$ , a value compatible with priority queuing theory. We document the existence of multifractality on the measure defined as the normalized number of bitcoins exchanged at a given time. |

Just like a double-edged sword, it also inadvertently becomes the safety net and breeding ground for illicit activities. Among them, cryptocurrencies have been prevalently abused to receive illicit income while evading regulations. Despite the continuing efforts to combat illicit activities, there is still a lack of an in-depth understanding regarding the characteristics and dynamics of cryptocurrency abuses on the dark web. In this work, we conduct a multi-dimensional and systematic study to track cryptocurrency-related illicit activities and campaigns on the dark web. We first harvest a dataset of 4,923 cryptocurrency-related onion sites with over 130K pages. Then, we detect and extract the illicit blockchain transactions to characterize the cryptocurrency abuses, targeting features from single/clustered addresses and illicit campaigns. Throughout our study, we have identified 2,564 illicit sites with 1,189 illicit blockchain addresses, which account for 90.8 BTC in revenue. Based on their inner connections, we further identify 66 campaigns behind them. Our exploration suggests that illicit activities on the dark web have strong correlations, which can guide us to identify new illicit blockchain addresses and onions, and raise alarms at the early stage of their deployment. |

This concept seeks to efficiently utilise budgeted staking rewards to attract and sustain liquidity through a risk-structuring engine and incentive allocation strategy, both of which are designed to maximise capital efficiency. The proposed protocol serves the dual objective of: (i) capital creation by attracting risk capital efficiently and maximising its operational utility for intrinsic DeFi applications, thereby asserting sustainability; and (ii) enhancing the adopting blockchain network's economic security by augmenting their staking (PoS) mechanism with a harmonious layer seeking to attract a diversity of digital assets. Finally, the protocol's conceptual framework, as detailed in the appendix, is extended to encompass service fee credits. This extension capitalises on the network's auxiliary services to disperse incentives and attract liquidity, ensuring the network achieves and maintains the critical usage threshold essential for its sustained operational viability and progressive growth. |
|**2024-01-09**|**Expiring Assets in Automated Market Makers**|Kenan Wood et.al.|[2401.04289](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04289)| An automated market maker (AMM) is a state machine that manages pools of assets, allowing parties to buy and sell those assets according to a fixed mathematical formula. AMMs are typically implemented as smart contracts on blockchains, and its prices are kept in line with the overall market price by arbitrage: if the AMM undervalues an asset with respect to the market, an "arbitrageur" can make a risk-free profit by buying just enough of that asset to bring the AMM's price back in line with the market.   AMMs, however, are not designed for assets that expire: that is, assets that cannot be produced or resold after a specified date. As assets approach expiration, arbitrage may not be able to reconcile supply and demand, and the liquidity providers that funded the AMM may have excessive exposure to risk due to rapid price variations.   This paper formally describes the design of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for assets that expire, combining aspects of AMMs and limit-order books. We ensure liveness and market clearance, providing mechanisms for liquidity providers to control their exposure to risk and adjust prices dynamically in response to situations where arbitrage may fail. |

This paper provides an overview of Nigeria's ICT journey, underscoring its central role in sustainable economic prosperity. We explore the potential of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT), revealing the remarkable opportunities on the horizon. We stress the urgency of achieving digital inclusivity, bridging the urban-rural gap, and reducing the technological divide, all of which are critical as Nigeria marks its sixtieth year. We intend to prove the invaluable opportunities of ICT for policymakers, business leaders, and educational institutes as Nigeria looks towards enduring economic development in this digital age. Specifically, we envision a dynamic landscape where emerging technologies are set to redefine industries, supercharge economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for every Nigerian. |

Its integration into the healthcare ecosystem has helped overcome numerous difficulties and constraints faced by healthcare systems. This has been notably demonstrated in the meticulous management of electronic health records (EHR) and their access rights, as well as in its capabilities in terms of security, scalability, flexibility, and interoperability with other systems. This article undertakes the study and analysis of the most commonly adopted approaches in healthcare data management systems using blockchain technology. An evaluation is then conducted based on a set of observed common characteristics, distinguishing one approach from the others. The results of this analysis highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach, thus facilitating the choice of the method best suited to the readers' specific case study. Furthermore, for effective implementation in the context of e-health, we emphasize the existence of crucial challenges, such as the incomplete representation of major stakeholders in the blockchain network, the lack of regulatory flexibility to ensure legal interoperability by country, and the insufficient integration of an official regulatory authority ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards. To address these challenges, it is necessary to establish close collaboration between regulators, technology developers, and healthcare stakeholders. |

M. et.al.|[2401.03552](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03552)| Federated Learning (FL) has recently arisen as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. According to this novel framework, multiple participants train a global model collaboratively, coordinating with a central aggregator without sharing their local data. As FL gains popularity in diverse domains, security, and privacy concerns arise due to the distributed nature of this solution. Therefore, integrating this strategy with Blockchain technology has been consolidated as a preferred choice to ensure the privacy and security of participants.   This paper explores the research efforts carried out by the scientific community to define privacy solutions in scenarios adopting Blockchain-Enabled FL. It comprehensively summarizes the background related to FL and Blockchain, evaluates existing architectures for their integration, and the primary attacks and possible countermeasures to guarantee privacy in this setting. Finally, it reviews the main application scenarios where Blockchain-Enabled FL approaches have been proficiently applied. This survey can help academia and industry practitioners understand which theories and techniques exist to improve the performance of FL through Blockchain to preserve privacy and which are the main challenges and future directions in this novel and still under-explored context. We believe this work provides a novel contribution respect to the previous surveys and is a valuable tool to explore the current landscape, understand perspectives, and pave the way for advancements or improvements in this amalgamation of Blockchain and Federated Learning. |

Successfully detecting anomalies within Blockchain transactions is essential for bolstering trust in digital payments. However, the task of anomaly detection in Blockchain transaction data is challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of illicit transactions. Although several studies have been conducted in the field, a limitation persists: the lack of explanations for the model's predictions. This study seeks to overcome this limitation by integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and anomaly rules into tree-based ensemble classifiers for detecting anomalous Bitcoin transactions. The Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed to measure the contribution of each feature, and it is compatible with ensemble models. Moreover, we present rules for interpreting whether a Bitcoin transaction is anomalous or not. Additionally, we have introduced an under-sampling algorithm named XGBCLUS, designed to balance anomalous and non-anomalous transaction data. This algorithm is compared against other commonly used under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. Finally, the outcomes of various tree-based single classifiers are compared with those of stacking and voting ensemble classifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that: (i) XGBCLUS enhances TPR and ROC-AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art under-sampling and over-sampling techniques, and (ii) our proposed ensemble classifiers outperform traditional single tree-based machine learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, TPR, and FPR scores. |
|**2024-01-05**|**Towards a zk-SNARK compiler for Wolfram language**|Armando Cruz et.al.|[2401.02935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02935)| Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-Proofs) are communication protocols by which a prover can demonstrate to a verifier that it possesses a solution to a given public problem without revealing the content of the solution. Arbitrary computations can be transformed into an interactive zk-Proof so anyone is convinced that it was executed correctly without knowing what was executed on, having huge implications for digital currency. Despite this, interactive proofs are not suited for blockchain applications but novel protocols such as zk-SNARKs have made zero-knowledge ledgers like Zcash possible. This project builds upon Wolfram's ZeroKnowledgeProofs paclet and implements a zk-SNARK compiler based on Pinocchio protocol. |
|**2024-01-05**|**An Analysis of Avalanche Consensus**|Ignacio Amores-Sesar et.al.|[2401.02811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02811)| A family of leaderless, decentralized consensus protocols, called Snow consensus was introduced in a recent whitepaper by Yin et al. These protocols address limitations of existing consensus methods, such as those using proof-of-work or quorums, by utilizing randomization and maintaining some level of resilience against Byzantine participants. Crucially, Snow consensus underpins the Avalanche blockchain, which provides a popular cryptocurrency and a platform for running smart contracts.   Snow consensus algorithms are built on a natural, randomized routine, whereby participants continuously sample subsets of others and adopt an observed majority value until consensus is achieved. Additionally, Snow consensus defines conditions based on participants' local views and security parameters. These conditions indicate when a party can confidently finalize its local value, knowing it will be adopted by honest participants.   Although Snow consensus algorithms can be formulated concisely, there is a complex interaction between randomization, adversarial influence, and security parameters, which requires a formal analysis of their security and liveness. Snow protocols form the foundation for Avalanche-type blockchains, and this work aims to increase our understanding of such protocols by providing insights into their liveness and safety characteristics. First, we analyze these Snow protocols in terms of latency and security. Second, we expose a design issue where the trade-off between these two is unfavorable. Third, we propose a modification of the original protocol where this trade-off is much more favorable. |
|**2024-01-10**|**Benchmark Performance of Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key Cryptography for Key Encapsulation and Digital Signature Schemes**|Randy Kuang et.al.|[2401.02803](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02803)| This paper conducts a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of the performance of two innovative cryptographic schemes: Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK)-Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signature (DS), recently proposed by Kuang et al. These schemes represent a departure from traditional cryptographic paradigms, with HPPK leveraging the security of homomorphic symmetric encryption across two hidden rings without reliance on NP-hard problems. HPPK can be viewed as a specialized variant of Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC), intricately associated with two vector spaces: the polynomial vector space for the secret exchange and the multivariate vector space for randomized encapsulation.   The unique integration of asymmetric, symmetric, and homomorphic cryptography within HPPK necessitates a careful examination of its performance metrics. This study focuses on the thorough benchmarking of HPPK KEM and DS across key cryptographic operations, encompassing key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. The results highlight the exceptional efficiency of HPPK, characterized by compact key sizes, cipher sizes, and signature sizes. The use of symmetric encryption in HPPK enhances its overall performance. Key findings underscore the outstanding performance of HPPK KEM and DS across various security levels, emphasizing their superiority in crucial cryptographic operations. This research positions HPPK as a promising and competitive solution for post-quantum cryptographic applications in a wide range of applications, including blockchain, digital currency, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. |
|**2024-01-04**|**Travelers: A scalable fair ordering BFT system**|Bowen Xue et.al.|[2401.02030](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02030)| Many blockchain platform are subject to maximal value extraction (MEV), and users on the platform are losing money while sending transactions because the transaction order can be manipulated to extract value from them. Consensus protocols have been augmented with different notion of fair ordering in order to counter the problem. Out of all practical protocols, the most efficient BFT consensus requires $O(nTL + n^2T)$ communication complexity, where $n$ is number node, $T$ is number of transactions and $L$ is average transaction size. In this work, we propose a new system of BFT fair ordering protocols, Travelers, that substantially reduce the communication complexity. The proposed system of protocols satisfy a new notion of fair ordering, called probabilistic fair ordering, which is an extension to some existing notions of fairness. The new notion allows a small probability of error $\epsilon$, that adversary can insert some transactions at any location in a block, but for the remaining $1-\epsilon$ the a modified version of ordering linearizability holds. Our mechanism neither require a dissemination network nor direct submissions to all consensus nodes. The key innovation comes from a routing protocol, that is both flexible and efficient. We construct a protocol with $O(c\log({n})TL + n^2)$ communication complexity with $\epsilon = 1/n^c$ for some system parameter $c\ge 1$ . |
|**2024-01-03**|**DApps Ecosystems: Mapping the Network Structure of Smart Contract Interactions**|Sabrina Aufiero et.al.|[2401.01991](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01991)| In recent years, decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and coded in languages such as Solidity, have gained attention for their potential to disrupt traditional centralized systems. Despite their rapid adoption, limited research has been conducted to understand the underlying code structure of these applications. In particular, each dApp is composed of multiple smart contracts, each containing a number of functions that can be called to trigger a specific event, e.g., a token transfer. In this paper, we reconstruct and analyse the network of contracts and functions calls within the dApp, which is helpful to unveil vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attackers. We show how decentralization is architecturally implemented, identifying common development patterns and anomalies that could influence the system's robustness and efficiency. We find a consistent network structure characterized by modular, self-sufficient contracts and a complex web of function interactions, indicating common coding practices across the blockchain community. Critically, a small number of key functions within each dApp play a pivotal role in maintaining network connectivity, making them potential targets for cyber attacks and highlighting the need for robust security measures. |
|**2024-01-03**|**Architectural Design for Secure Smart Contract Development**|Myles Lewis et.al.|[2401.01891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01891)| As time progresses, the need for more secure applications grows exponentially. The different types of sensitive information that is being transferred virtually has sparked a rise in systems that leverage blockchain. Different sectors are beginning to use this disruptive technology to evaluate the risks and benefits. Sectors like finance, medicine, higher education, and wireless communication have research regarding blockchain. Futhermore, the need for security standards in this area of research is pivotal. In recent past, several attacks on blockchain infrastructures have resulted in hundreds of millions dollars lost and sensitive information compromised. Some of these attacks include DAO attacks, bZx attacks, and Parity Multisignature Wallet Double Attacks which targeted vulnerabilities within smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These attacks exposed the weaknesses of current smart contract development practices which has led to the increase in distrust and adoption of systems that leverage blockchain for its functionality. In this paper, I identify common software vulnerabilities and attacks on blockchain infrastructures, thoroughly detail the smart contract development process and propose a model for ensuring a stronger security standard for future systems leveraging smart contracts. The purpose for proposing a model is to promote trust among end users in the system which is a foundational element for blockchain adoption in the future. |

|**2024-01-03**|**Energy Sharing among Resources within Electrical Distribution Systems: A Systematic Review**|G Hari Krishna et.al.|[2401.01597](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01597)| The rapid increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption provides a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency in transportation systems. However, the increasing numbers of EVs pose significant challenges to the electrical grids. In addition, the number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to meet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure. Recently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from DERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs. Accommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution systems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and resilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the critical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems with grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency in DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution systems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and algorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market clearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain technology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other models from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the policies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and challenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs. A roadmap for future research and sharing strategies is provided to guide policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders toward a sustainable, resilient, and efficient energy market by integrating P2P technology into EVCIs and MGs. |
|**2023-12-31**|**The predictive power of the Blockhain transaction networks: Towards a new generation of network science market indicators**|Mar Grande et.al.|[2401.01379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01379)| Currently cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which enable financial services on public blockchains, represents a new growing trend in finance. In contrast to financial markets, ruled by traditional corporations, DeFi is completely transparent as it keeps records of all transactions that occur in the network and makes them publicly available. The availability of the data represents an opportunity to analyze and understand the market from the complexity that emerges from the interactions of the actors (users, bots and companies) operating in the embedded market. In this paper we focus on the Ethereum network and our main goal is to show that the properties of the underlying transaction network provide further and useful information to forecast the evolution of the market. We aim to separate the non redundant effects of the blockchain transaction network properties from classic technical indicators and social media trends in the future price of Ethereum. To this end, we build two machine learning models to predict the future trend of the market. The first one serves as a base model and considers a set of the most relevant features according to the current scientific literature including technical indicators and social media trends. The second model considers the features of the base model, together with the network properties computed from the transaction networks. We found that the full model outperforms the base model and can anticipate 46 more rises in the price than the base model and 19 more falls. |
|**2024-01-09**|**The Boomerang protocol: A Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Incentive Protocol**|Ralph Ankele et.al.|[2401.01353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01353)| In the era of data-driven economies, incentive systems and loyalty programs, have become ubiquitous in various sectors, including advertising, retail, travel, and financial services. While these systems offer advantages for both users and companies, they necessitate the transfer and analysis of substantial amounts of sensitive data. Privacy concerns have become increasingly pertinent, necessitating the development of privacy-preserving incentive protocols. Despite the rising demand for secure and decentralized systems, the existing landscape lacks a comprehensive solution. We propose the Boomerang protocol, a novel decentralized privacy-preserving incentive protocol that leverages cryptographic black box accumulators to securely store user interactions within the incentive system. Moreover, the protocol employs zero-knowledge proofs based on BulletProofs to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy. To further enhance public verifiability and transparency, we utilize a smart contract on a Layer 1 blockchain to verify these zero-knowledge proofs. The careful combination of black box accumulators with selected elliptic curves in the zero-knowledge proofs makes the Boomerang protocol highly efficient. Our proof of concept implementation shows that we can handle up to 23.6 million users per day, on a single-threaded backend server with financial costs of approximately 2 USD. Using the Solana blockchain we can handle 15.5 million users per day with approximate costs of 0.00011 USD per user. The Boomerang protocol represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving incentive protocols, laying the groundwork for a more secure and privacy-centric future. |
|**2024-01-08**|**PPBFL: A Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model**|Yang Li et.al.|[2401.01204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01204)| With the rapid development of machine learning and a growing concern for data privacy, federated learning has become a focal point of attention. However, attacks on model parameters and a lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning. Therefore, we propose A Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and encourage active participation of nodes in model training. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing protection against tampering. Within the blockchain, we introduce a Proof of Training Work (PoTW) consensus algorithm tailored for federated learning, aiming to incentive training nodes. This algorithm rewards nodes with greater computational power, promoting increased participation and effort in the federated learning process. A novel adaptive differential privacy algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models. This safeguards the privacy of local data at training clients, preventing malicious nodes from launching inference attacks. Additionally, it enhances the security of the global model, preventing potential security degradation resulting from the combination of numerous local models. The possibility of security degradation is derived from the composition theorem. By introducing reverse noise in the global model, a zero-bias estimate of differential privacy noise between local and global models is achieved. Furthermore, we propose a new mix transactions mechanism utilizing ring signature technology to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL, compared to baseline methods, not only exhibits superior model performance but also achieves higher security. |
|**2024-01-01**|**Automated Invariant Generation for Solidity Smart Contracts**|Ye Liu et.al.|[2401.00650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00650)| Smart contracts are computer programs running on blockchains to automate the transaction execution between users. The absence of contract specifications poses a real challenge to the correctness verification of smart contracts. Program invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the execution, which characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, INVCON+, for Solidity smart contracts. INVCON+ extends the existing invariant detector, InvCon, to automatically produce verified contract invariants based on both dynamic inference and static verification. Unlike INVCON+, InvCon only produces likely invariants, which have a high probability to hold, yet are still not verified against the contract code. Particularly, INVCON+ is able to infer more expressive invariants that capture richer semantic relations of contract code. We evaluate INVCON+ on 361 ERC20 and 10 ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as common ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that INVCON+ efficiently produces high-quality invariant specifications, which can be used to secure smart contracts from common vulnerabilities. |
|**2024-01-01**|**TBDD: A New Trust-based, DRL-driven Framework for Blockchain Sharding in IoT**|Zixu Zhang et.al.|[2401.00632](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00632)| Integrating sharded blockchain with IoT presents a solution for trust issues and optimized data flow. Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its nodes into parallel shards, yet it's vulnerable to the $1\%$ attacks where dishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing security with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional optimization. This paper introduces a Trust-based and DRL-driven (\textsc{TbDd}) framework, crafted to counter shard collusion risks and dynamically adjust node allocation, enhancing throughput while maintaining network security. With a comprehensive trust evaluation mechanism, \textsc{TbDd} discerns node types and performs targeted resharding against potential threats. The model maximizes tolerance for dishonest nodes, optimizes node movement frequency, ensures even node distribution in shards, and balances sharding risks. Rigorous evaluations prove \textsc{TbDd}'s superiority over conventional random-, community-, and trust-based sharding methods in shard risk equilibrium and reducing cross-shard transactions. |

However, given the high sensitivity of the industry to the security of industrial control system networks and IIoT, the use of software-defined networking (SDN) technology can provide improved security and automation of communication processes. Despite this, the architecture of SDN can give rise to various security threats. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider the impact of these threats on SDN-based IIoT environments. Unlike previous research, which focused on security in IIoT and SDN architectures separately, we propose an integrated method including two components that work together seamlessly for better detecting and preventing security threats associated with SDN-based IIoT architectures. The two components consist in a convolutional neural network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented as an SDN application and a Blockchain-based system (BS) to empower application layer and network layer security, respectively. A significant advantage of the proposed method lies in jointly minimizing the impact of attacks such as command injection and rule injection on SDN-based IIoT architecture layers. The proposed IDS exhibits superior classification accuracy in both binary and multiclass categories. |

Without a third-party interface or what is known as a Blockchain Oracle, it can not interact with the external world. This Oracle plays a crucial role by feeding extrinsic data into the Blockchain, ensuring that Smart Contracts operate accurately in real time. The Oracle problem arises from the inherent difficulty in verifying the truthfulness of the data sourced by these Oracles. The genuineness of a Blockchain Oracle is paramount, as it directly influences the Blockchain's reliability, credibility, and scalability. To tackle these challenges, a strategy rooted in Byzantine fault tolerance {\phi} is introduced. Furthermore, an autonomous system for sustainability and audibility, built on heuristic detection, is put forth. The effectiveness and precision of the proposed strategy outperformed existing methods using two real-world datasets, aimed to meet the authenticity standards for Blockchain Oracles. |

Web 3.0 is driven by secure keys, typically represented in hexadecimal, that are pseudo-randomly generated by an initialization vector and complex computational algorithms. We demonstrate that the statistical physical Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) scheme eliminates the additional computational power by naturally generating truly random binary keys to drive the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that are appended to an Ethereum blockchain. |
|**2023-12-28**|**Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Public Key Searchable Encryption with Strong Traceability**|Yue Han et.al.|[2312.16954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16954)| Public key searchable encryption (PKSE) scheme allows data users to search over encrypted data. To identify illegal users, many traceable PKSE schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot trace the keywords which illegal users searched and protect users' privacy simultaneously. In some practical applications, tracing both illegal users' identities and the keywords which they searched is quite important to against the abuse of data. It is a challenge to bind users' identities and keywords while protecting their privacy. Moreover, existing traceable PKSE schemes do not consider the unforgeability and immutability of trapdoor query records, which can lead to the occurrence of frame-up and denying. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving PKSE with strong traceability (BP3KSEST) scheme. Our scheme provides the following features: (1) authorized users can authenticate to trapdoor generation center and obtain trapdoors without releasing their identities and keywords; (2) when data users misbehave in the system, the trusted third party (TTP) can trace both their identities and the keywords which they searched; (3) trapdoor query records are unforgeable; (4) trapdoor query records are immutable because records are stored in blockchain. Notably, this scheme is suitable to the scenarios where privacy must be considered, e.g., electronic health record (EHR). We formalize both the definition and security model of our BP3KSEST scheme, and present a concrete construction. Furthermore, the security of the proposed scheme is formally proven. Finally, the implementation and evaluation are conducted to analyze its efficiency. |

ANKA utilizes state-of-the-art technologies, namely blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Within this marketplace, users who possess surplus energy actively offer their excess energy for trading. Concurrently, consumers can readily explore the energy options available and make purchases according to their individual preferences while taking into consideration the location of the offered energy and voltage compatibility. In addition, we provide a comparison between a centralized traditional market and our proposed solution, identifying that the cost of deploying and operating ANKA is less than the centralized approach. We also position ANKA in comparison to the recent blockchain-based decentralized energy marketplaces by considering the metrics of blockchain type, scope, trading entities and the presence of third parties. |

In this paper we introduce an innovative methodology designed to detect wash trading activities beyond surface-level transactions. Our approach integrates NFT ownership traces with the Ethereum Transaction Network, encompassing the complete historical record of all Ethereum account normal transactions. By analyzing both networks, our method offers a notable advancement over techniques proposed by existing research. We analyzed the wash trading activity of 7 notable NFT collections. Our results show that wash trading in unregulated NFT markets is an underestimated concern and is much more widespread both in terms of frequency as well as volume. Excluding the Meebits collection, which emerged as an outlier, we found that wash trading constituted up to 25% of the total trading volume. Specifically, for the Meebits collection, a staggering 93% of its total trade volume was attributed to wash trading. |

In 2023 alone, such vulnerabilities led to substantial financial losses exceeding a billion of US dollars. To counter these threats, various tools have been developed by academic and commercial entities to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our study investigates the gap between the effectiveness of existing security scanners and the vulnerabilities that still persist in practice. We compiled four distinct datasets for this analysis. The first dataset comprises 77,219 source codes extracted directly from the blockchain, while the second includes over 4 million bytecodes obtained from Ethereum Mainnet and testnets. The other two datasets consist of nearly 14,000 manually annotated smart contracts and 373 smart contracts verified through audits, providing a foundation for a rigorous ground truth analysis on bytecode and source code. Using the unlabeled datasets, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 17 vulnerability scanners, revealing considerable discrepancies in their findings. Our analysis of the ground truth datasets indicated poor performance across all the tools we tested. This study unveils the reasons for poor performance and underscores that the current state of the art for smart contract security falls short in effectively addressing open problems, highlighting that the challenge of effectively detecting vulnerabilities remains a significant and unresolved issue. |

This work aims to empirically study LN's fee revenue for network participants. Under realistic assumptions on payment amounts, routing algorithms and traffic distribution, we analyze the economic returns of the network's largest routing nodes which currently hold the network together, and assess whether the centralizing tendency is incentive-compatible from an economic viewpoint. Moreover, since recent literature has proved that participation is economically irrational for the majority of large nodes, we evaluate the long-term impact on the network topology when participants start behaving rationally. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Blockchain-Envisioned Post-Quantum Secure Sanitizable Signature for Audit Logs Management**|Vikas Srivastava et.al.|[2312.16322](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16322)| Audit logs are one of the most important tools for transparently tracking system events and maintaining continuous oversight in corporate organizations and enterprise business systems. There are many cases where the audit logs contain sensitive data, or the audit logs are enormous. In these situations, dealing with a subset of the data is more practical than the entire data set. To provide a secure solution to handle these issues, a sanitizable signature scheme (SSS) is a viable cryptographic primitive. Herein, we first present the first post-quantum secure multivariate-based SSS, namely Mul-SAN. Our proposed design provides unforgeability, privacy, immutability, signer accountability, and sanitizer accountability under the assumption that the MQ problem is NP-hard. Mul-SAN is very efficient and only requires computing field multiplications and additions over a finite field for its implementation. Mul-SAN presents itself as a practical method to partially delegate control of the authenticated data in avenues like the healthcare industry and government organizations. We also explore using Blockchain to provide a tamper-proof and robust audit log mechanism. |

The permissioned layer-2, by relying on the public consensus of the underlying network, assures the security and integrity of the transactions and ensures interoperability with domestic CBDCs implementations. Multiple Layer-3s operate various Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and compete with each other for the lowest costs. To provide insights into the practical implications of the system, simulations of trading costs are conducted based on historical FX rates, with Project Mariana as a benchmark. The study shows that, even with liquidity fragmentation, a multi-layer and multi-AMM setup is more cost-efficient than a single AMM. |

Blockchains are known for their distinctive features, such as decentralized architecture, tamper-proof data structures, and traceable transactions. These features make Blockchain a preferred choice of platform for developing applications in financial service areas. Meanwhile, some questions have been raised regarding Blockchain's suitability to compete with or even replace existing financial systems.

In particular, reentrancy vulnerability, which is hidden and complex, poses a great threat to smart contracts. In order to improve the existing detection methods, which exhibit low efficiency and accuracy, in this paper, we propose a smart contract threat detection technology based on symbolic execution. In this method, first, the recursive descent algorithm is used to recover the basic blocks of contract code and control flow diagram, and static type inference is performed for static single assignment (SSA) variables. Then, the control flow diagram is encoded into constrained horn clause (CHC) constraints in combination with the symbolic execution technology. Model checking is conducted for the generated constraints using an automatic theorem prover based on the abstraction refinement technique for fast static detection of common security threats in smart contracts. Compared with existing detection methods, the method proposed in this paper allows the detection of both the checks-effects-interactions pattern and the vulnerability in relation to reentrant locks. It can simulate the state changes of reentrant locks as well as other global variables in multiple recursive transactions. The experimental results show that this method significantly increases both detection efficiency and accuracy, improving the security of smart contracts. |

It is designed to reduce theft and losses on the blockchain by allowing a victim to recover their stolen or lost assets during the recovery window. When an honest recipient receives an ERC-20R asset, they must wait until the recovery windows elapses (say, 24 hours), before they can unwrap the asset back to its base ERC-20 form. We argue that many DeFi services will likely refuse to accept unsettled recoverable assets because they can interfere with their normal operations. Consequently, when Alice receives an ERC-20R token, she must wait 24 hours before she can use it with a DeFi service. But what if Alice is willing to pay a fee to exchange the wrapped token for an unwrapped ERC-20 token that can be used right away? In this paper we explore how to design a pool to exchange an unsettled ERC-20R asset for a base ERC-20 of the same asset. Designing such a pool raises several challenging questions and we present our solutions. |

The phenomenon of sextortion is now widely studied by psychologists, sociologists, criminologists, etc. The findings have been translated into scattered help from NGOs, specialized law enforcement units, and therapists, who usually do not coordinate their efforts among each other. This paper addresses the gap of lacking coordination systems to effectively and efficiently use modern information technologies that align the efforts of scattered and non-aligned sextortion help organizations. Consequently, this paper not only investigates the goals, incentives, and disincentives for a system design and development that not only governs effectively and efficiently diverse cases of sextortion victims, but also leverages artificial intelligence in a targeted manner. It explores how AI and, in particular, autonomous cognitive entities can improve victim profiles analysis, streamline support mechanisms, and provide intelligent insight into sextortion cases. Furthermore, the paper conceptually studies the extent to which such efforts can be monetized in a sustainable way. Following a novel design methodology for the design of trusted blockchain decentralized applications, the paper presents a set of conceptual requirements and system models based on which it is possible to deduce a best-practice technology stack for rapid implementation deployment. |
|**2023-12-21**|**Dynamic Mining Interval to Improve Blockchain Throughput**|Hou-Wan Long et.al.|[2312.14038](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14038)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi), propelled by Blockchain technology, has revolutionized traditional financial systems, improving transparency, reducing costs, and fostering financial inclusion. However, transaction activities in these systems fluctuate significantly and the throughput can be effected. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Mining Interval (DMI) mechanism that adjusts mining intervals in response to block size and trading volume to enhance the transaction throughput of Blockchain platforms. Besides, in the context of public Blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, a shift towards transaction fees dominance over coin-based rewards is projected in near future. As a result, the ecosystem continues to face threats from deviant mining activities such as Undercutting Attacks, Selfish Mining, and Pool Hopping, among others. In recent years, Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies were proposed to allocate transactions dynamically based on fees thereby stabilizing block incentives. However, DTS' utilization of Merkle tree leaf nodes can reduce system throughput. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach for combining DMI and DTS. Besides, we also discuss the DMI selection mechanism for adjusting mining intervals based on various factors. |

Analyzing Blockchain Decentralization**|Shashank Motepalli et.al.|[2312.13938](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13938)| In the PoS blockchain landscape, the challenge of achieving full decentralization is often hindered by a disproportionate concentration of staked tokens among a few validators. This study analyses this challenge by first formalizing decentralization metrics for weighted consensus mechanisms. An empirical analysis across ten permissionless blockchains uncovers significant weight concentration among validators, underscoring the need for an equitable approach. To counter this, we introduce the Square Root Stake Weight (SRSW) model, which effectively recalibrates staking weight distribution. Our examination of the SRSW model demonstrates notable improvements in the decentralization metrics: the Gini index improves by 37.16% on average, while Nakamoto coefficients for liveness and safety see mean enhancements of 101.04% and 80.09%, respectively. This research is a pivotal step toward a more fair and equitable distribution of staking weight, advancing the decentralization in blockchain consensus mechanisms. |

A Delphi Study**|Giulio Caldarelli et.al.|[2312.13774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13774)| Given the rising interest in the circular economy and blockchain hype, numerous integrations were proposed. However, studies on the practical feasibility were scarce, and the assumptions of blockchain potential in the circular economy were rarely questioned. With the help of eleven of the most prominent blockchain experts, the present study critically analyzed technology integration in many areas of the circular economy to forecast their possible outcomes. Delphi's technique is leveraged to reach a consensus among experts' visions and opinions. Results support the view that some circular economy integrations are unlikely to succeed, while others if specific conditions are met, may prove to be successful in the long run. |
|**2024-06-10**|**Automated Market Maker on the XRP Ledger**|Firas Dahi et.al.|[2312.13749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13749)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a transformative force in the financial sector, with Automated Market Makers (AMMs) playing a crucial role in facilitating asset exchange and liquidity provision. However, most AMMs operate on the Ethereum blockchain and face challenges such as high transaction fees and price synchronization issues mainly due to Ethereum scalability issues.   This paper addresses these limitations by investigating the performance of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) integrated at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. Using game-theoretic simulations, we compared the XRPL-AMM to a Generic CPMM-based AMM (G-AMM) on Ethereum, akin to established players like Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation. The results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM outperforms in terms of price synchronization with external markets, lower slippage, reduced impermanent loss, and improved returns for liquidity providers, particularly under volatile market conditions. The unique Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) of the XRPL-AMM further enhances its efficiency by incentivizing beneficial arbitrage. These findings highlight the potential of protocol-level AMM integration.   To the best of our knowledge, the XRPL-AMM is one of the first AMMs built directly at the protocol level of a blockchain. Therefore, this inaugural study ventures into the unexplored domain of evaluating AMMs with protocol-level integration compared to traditional smart contracts implementations. |
|**2024-03-15**|**Quick Order Fairness: Implementation and Evaluation**|Christian Cachin et.al.|[2312.13107](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13107)| Decentralized finance revolutionizes traditional financial systems by leveraging blockchain technology to reduce trust. However, some vulnerabilities persist, notably front-running by malicious actors who exploit transaction information to gain financial advantage. Consensus with a fair order aims at preventing such attacks, and in particular, the differential order fairness property addresses this problem and connects fair ordering to the validity of consensus. The notion is implemented by the Quick Order-Fair Atomic Broadcast (QOF) protocol (Cachin et al., FC '22). This paper revisits the QOF protocol and describes a modular implementation that uses a generic consensus component. Moreover, an empirical evaluation is performed to compare the performance of QOF to a consensus protocol without fairness. Measurements show that the increased complexity comes at a cost, throughput decreases by at most 5%, and latency increases by roughly 50ms, using an emulated ideal network. This paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of practical aspects regarding differential order fairness with the QOF protocol and also connects this with similar fairness-imposing protocols like Themis and Pompe. |
|**2023-12-20**|**Research on the Development of Blockchain-based Distributed Intelligent Healthcare Industry -- A Policy Analysis Perspective**|Yang Yue et.al.|[2312.12817](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12817)| As a pivotal innovation in digital infrastructure, blockchain ledger technology catalyzes the development of nascent business paradigms and applications globally. Utilizing Rothwell and Zegveld's taxonomy of twelve innovation policy tools, this study offers a nuanced comparison of domestic blockchain policies, dissecting supply, environment, and demand-driven policy dimensions to distill prevailing strategic orientations towards blockchain healthcare adoption. The findings indicate that blockchain technology has seen rapid growth in the healthcare industry. However, a certain misalignment exists between the corporate and policy layers in terms of supply and demand. While companies focus more on technological applications, existing policies are geared towards regulations and governance. Government emphasis lies on legal supervision through environmental policies, aiming to guide the standardization and regulation of blockchain technology. This maintains a balance between encouraging innovation and market and legal regulatory order, thereby providing a reference for the development of the distributed intelligent healthcare industry in our country. |
|**2023-12-19**|**FairFlow Protocol: Equitable Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) mitigation in Ethereum**|Dipankar Sarkar et.al.|[2312.12654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12654)| Ethereum has emerged as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) due to its robust smart contract capabilities. One of the critical issues in the Ethereum ecosystem is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a concept that has gained significant attention in the blockchain community. However, MEV has remained a major challenge with significant implications for the platform's operation and integrity. This paper introduces the FairFlow protocol, a novel framework designed to mitigate the effects of MEV within Ethereum's existing infrastructure. The protocol aims to provide a more equitable environment, preventing exploitation by miners or validators, and protecting user data. The combined approach of auction-based block space allocation and randomized transaction ordering significantly reduces the potential for MEV exploitation. |

Although bridges are becoming increasingly popular, they are still in their infancy and have been attacked multiple times recently, causing significant financial loss. Although there are numerous reports online explaining each of the incidents on cross-chain bridges, they are scattered over the Internet, and there is no work that analyzes the security landscape of cross-chain bridges in a holistic manner. To fill the gap, in this paper, we performed a systematic study of cross-chain bridge security issues. First, we summarize the characteristics of existing cross-chain bridges, including their usages, verification mechanisms, communication models, and three categorizations. Based on these characteristics, we identify 12 potential attack vectors that attackers may exploit. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that categorizes cross-chain attacks in the past two years into 10 distinct types, and then provide explanations for each vulnerability type, accompanied by Solidity code examples. We also discuss existing and potential defenses, as well as open questions and future research directions on cross-chain bridges. We believe that this systematization can shed light on designing and implementing cross-chain bridges with higher security and, more importantly, facilitating future research on building a better cross-chain bridge ecosystem. |

Flanery et.al.|[2312.12268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12268)| With the natural evolution of the web, the need for decentralization has rendered the current centralized education system out of date. The student does not "own" their credentials, as the only way their accomplishments are directly linked to their person and considered valuable is by verification through a stamp of an expensive, prestigious institution. However, going to a university is no longer the only way to acquire an education; open-source learning material is widely available and accessible through the internet. However, our society does not deem these methods of education as verifiable if they do not include a degree or certificate. Additionally, a valid certificate for the vast majority of open-source courses costs a few hundred dollars to obtain. The centralized nature of education inadvertently places students in underprivileged communities at a disadvantage in comparison to students in economically advantaged communities, thus a decentralized approach to education would eliminate the vast majority of such discrepancies. In the present paper, we integrate Decentralized Identity (DID) with Web 3.0 to upload credentials linked directly to the user. Each credential is appended to an Ethereum blockchain that, by design, cannot be altered once uploaded. We include DID document based access controls to display the candidate's upload and verification history. Finally, we utilize TLS protocols to provide a secure connection to the internet for ensuring non-fungibility of credentials and authentication of users. |

Nevertheless, this technique introduces various privacy concerns, including pseudonymity, Sybil attacks, and potential susceptibilities to quantum computing, to name a few. In response to these challenges, innovative privacy-enhancing solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and stealth addresses (SA) have been developed. Among the various schemes, SA stands out as it prevents the association of a blockchain transaction's output with the recipient's public address, thereby ensuring transactional anonymity. However, the basic SA schemes have exhibited vulnerabilities to key leakage and quantum computing attacks. To address these shortcomings, we present a pioneering solution - Homomorphic Encryption-based Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (HE-DKSAP), which can be further extended to Fully HE-DKSAP (FHE-DKSAP). By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, HE-DKSAP introduces a novel approach to safeguarding transaction privacy and preventing potential quantum computing attacks. This paper delves into the core principles of HE-DKSAP, highlighting its capacity to enhance privacy, scalability, and security in programmable blockchains. Through a comprehensive exploration of its design architecture, security analysis, and practical implementations, this work establishes a privacy-preserving, practical, and efficient stealth address protocol via additively homomorphic encryption. |

However, current DTNs networking frameworks pose a number of challenges especially when applied in scenarios that require high communication efficiency and multimodal data processing. First, current DTNs frameworks are unavoidable regarding high resource consumption and communication congestion because of original bit-level communication and high-frequency computation, especially distributed learning-based DTNs. Second, current machine learning models for DTNs are domain-specific (e.g. E-health), making it difficult to handle DT scenarios with multimodal data processing requirements. Last but not least, current security schemes for DTNs, such as blockchain, introduce additional overheads that impair the efficiency of DTNs. To address the above challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM) empowered DTNs networking framework, LLM-Twin. First, we design the mini-giant model collaboration scheme to achieve efficient deployment of LLM in DTNs, since LLM are naturally conducive to processing multimodal data. Then, we design a semantic-level high-efficiency, and secure communication model for DTNs. The feasibility of LLM-Twin is demonstrated by numerical experiments and case studies. To our knowledge, this is the first to propose LLM-based semantic-level digital twin networking framework. |

Despite stringent regulations like HIPAA, significant gaps in policy compliance often remain undetected until a data breach occurs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel blockchain-powered, smart contract-based access control model. This model is specifically designed to enforce patient-provider agreements (PPAs) and other relevant policies, thereby ensuring both policy compliance and provenance. Our approach integrates components of informed consent into PPAs, employing blockchain smart contracts to automate and secure policy enforcement. The authorization module utilizes these contracts to make informed access decisions, recording all actions in a transparent, immutable blockchain ledger. This system not only ensures that policies are rigorously applied but also maintains a verifiable record of all actions taken, thus facilitating an easy audit and proving compliance. We implement this model in a private Ethereum blockchain setup, focusing on maintaining the integrity and lineage of policies and ensuring that audit trails are accurately and securely recorded. The Proof of Compliance (PoC) consensus mechanism enables decentralized, independent auditor nodes to verify compliance status based on the audit trails recorded. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in a simulated healthcare environment. The results show that our approach not only strengthens policy compliance and provenance but also enhances the transparency and accountability of the entire process. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive, blockchain-based solution to a longstanding problem in healthcare data management, offering a robust framework for ensuring policy compliance and provenance through smart contracts and blockchain technology. |

Its true potential is not practically utilized yet. In a very short period of time, it has evolved twice - Smart contracts and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAG based blockchains currently referred to as Blockchain 3.0 solves many issues in the current conventional blockchain technologies including transaction fees, transaction approval times and scalability. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of blockchain implementations based on DAG including IOTA, NxT, Byteball, Nano, DAGCoin, Fantom, XDAG and Caixapay. We discuss limitations of both conventional and DAG based blockchains and suggest when to prefer DAG based blockchains. |

Starting with the Proof-of-Work, there have been various versions of consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Each of these algorithms focuses on different aspects to ensure efficient and reliable processing of transactions. Blockchain operates in a decentralized manner where there is no central authority and the network is composed of diverse users. This openness creates the potential for malicious nodes to disrupt the network in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to embed a mechanism within the blockchain network to constantly monitor, identify, and eliminate these malicious nodes. However, there is no one-size-fits-all mechanism to identify all malicious nodes. Hence, the dynamic adaptability of the blockchain network is important to maintain security and reliability at all times. This paper introduces MRL-PoS, a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. MRL-PoS employs reinforcement learning for dynamically adjusting to the behavior of all users. It incorporates a system of rewards and penalties to eliminate malicious nodes and incentivize honest ones. Additionally, MRL-PoS has the capability to learn and respond to new malicious tactics by continually training its agents. |

Utilizing an immutable endpoint, append-only verification modules, and fully-configurable verification infrastructure, LayerZero provides the security, configurability, and extensibility necessary to achieve omnichain interoperability. LayerZero enforces strict application-exclusive ownership of protocol security and cost through its novel trust-minimized modular security framework which is designed to universally support all blockchains and use cases. Omnichain applications (OApps) built on the LayerZero protocol achieve frictionless blockchain-agnostic interoperation through LayerZero's universal network semantics. |

Software patterns have been proposed to summarize upgradeable smart contract best practices. However, research is missing on the comparison of these upgradeable smart contract patterns, especially regarding gas costs related to deployment and execution. This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of gas costs associated with two prevalent upgradeable smart contract patterns: the Proxy and diamond patterns. The Proxy pattern utilizes a Proxy pointing to a logic contract, while the diamond pattern enables a Proxy to point to multiple logic contracts. We conduct a comparative analysis of gas costs for both patterns in contrast to a traditional non-upgradeable smart contract. We derive from this analysis a theoretical contribution in the form of two consolidated blockchain patterns and a corresponding decision model. By so doing we hope to contribute to the broader understanding of upgradeable smart contract patterns. |

Blockchain consensus mechanisms (CMs) are key to enabling nodes in a wireless network to achieve consistency without any trusted entity. However, consensus reliability will be seriously affected by the instability of communication links in wireless networks. Meanwhile, it is difficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. Energy-intensive blockchain functions can quickly drain the power of nodes, thus degrading consensus performance. Fortunately, a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can solve the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages over the radio frequency (RF) signal emitted from a primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption, and the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. Such an approach is useful for almost all vote-based CMs, such as the Practical Byzantine Fault-tolerant (PBFT)-like and the RAFT-like CMs. This paper proposes symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC) by transforming 6 PBFT-like and 4 RAFT-like state-of-the-art (SOTA) CMs to demonstrate universality. These new CMs will benefit from mutualistic transmission relationships in SR, making full use of the limited spectrum resources in WBN. Simulation results show that SBC can increase the consensus success rate of PBFT-like and RAFT-like by 54.1% and 5.8%, respectively, and reduce energy consumption by 9.2% and 23.7%, respectively. |

Currently, cloud providers lack simple, efficient, and secure implementation of provisioning solutions that meet these challenges. Multi-cloud federation is a promising approach. In this paper, we evaluate the application of private and public blockchain networks for multi-cloud federation. We compare the performance of blockchain-based federation in private and public blockchain networks and their integration with a production-ready orchestration solution. Our results show that the public blockchain needs approximately 91 seconds to complete the federation procedure compared to the 48 seconds in the private blockchain scenario. |

Despite being a secured network, blockchains have some tradeoffs such as high latency, low throughput, and transaction failures. One of the core problems behind these is improper management of "conflicting transactions", which is also known as "contention". When there is a large pool of pending transactions in a blockchain and some of them are conflicting, a situation of contention occurs, and as a result, the latency of the network increases, and a substantial amount of resources are wasted which results in low throughput and transaction failures. In this paper, we proposed ConChain, a novel blockchain scheme that combines transaction parallelism and an intelligent dependency manager to minimize conflicting transactions in blockchain networks as well as improve performance. ConChain is also capable of ensuring proper defense against major attacks due to contention. |

In our framework, {we design a low-latency reputation-based proof-of-stake (RPoS) consensus protocol to select highly reliable blockchain-enabled BSs to securely store MEC user requests and prevent data tampering attacks.} {We formulate the MEC resource allocation optimization as a constrained Markov decision process that balances minimum processing latency and denial-of-service (DoS) probability}. {We use the MEC aggregated features as the DRL input to significantly reduce the high-dimensionality input of the remaining service processing time for individual MEC requests. Our designed constrained DRL effectively attains the optimal resource allocations that are adapted to the dynamic DoS requirements. We provide extensive simulation results and analysis to} validate that our BC-DRL framework achieves higher security, reliability, and resource utilization efficiency than benchmark blockchain consensus protocols and {MEC} resource allocation algorithms. |

This paper introduces a streamlined analytical framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), in this instance open-access generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, offering an efficient solution with deeper insights into community dynamics. The framework aids moderators in identifying pseudonymous actor intent, moderating toxic behavior, rewarding desired actions to avoid unintended consequences of blockchain-based gaming, and gauging community sentiment as communities venture into metaverse platforms and plan for hypergrowth. This framework strengthens community controls, eases onboarding, and promotes a common moral mission across communities while reducing agency costs by 95 pct. Highlighting the transformative role of generative AI, the paper emphasizes its potential to redefine the cost of cultural production. It showcases the utility of GPTs in digital community management, expanding their implications in cultural economics and transmedia storytelling. |

Typically, approaches in this field fall into two categories: either executing the entire process model on the blockchain or using the blockchain primarily to enforce or monitor the exchange of messages between participants. Our work proposes a novel approach that sits between these two methods.   We introduce a centralized process model extended with blockchain annotations, detailing the tasks of each participating organization and the extent to which blockchain technology is needed to secure task execution. This model also includes all critical data objects and specifies how their handling should be protected by the blockchain.   This technical report outlines a systematic three-step method for automatically decentralizing this comprehensive model into individual local process models for each organization, coupled with a separate process model for the blockchain. This decentralized structure effectively replicates the original global process model.   Our transformation approach is rule-based, focusing on creating a platform-inde-pendent model first, then a platform-specific model. Subsequently, we project the platform-specific model to obtain one model for the blockchain and one model for each participating organization. |

For example, one of their most critical applications is to provide seamless wireless communication services in remote rural areas. Thus, it is substantial to identify and consider the different security challenges in the research and development associated with advanced UAV-based B5G/6G architectures. Following this requirement, the present study thoroughly examines the security considerations about UAVs in relation to the architectural framework of the 5G/6G system, the technologies that facilitate its operation, and the concerns surrounding privacy.

Decentralized pub/sub aims to provide this functionality without relying on centralized control or global network state information, enabling message propagation among nodes in a coordinated manner. Efficiency in pub/sub services entails ensuring that subscribers receive published messages promptly. We introduce Topiary, a rapid and scalable protocol designed for decentralized applications' pub/sub systems. Topiary autonomously learns an efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) topology tailored to the publish/subscribe network. It does so by analyzing peers' interactions with their neighbors. Inspired by concepts from the multi-armed bandit problem, Topiary strikes an optimal balance between maintaining connections with well-connected neighbors and exploring new connections within the network, based on their topical needs. Through experimental evaluations, Topiary has shown a 50% reduction in broadcast latency while achieving an interested topic coverage of over 98%, marking it as a promising solution for efficient decentralized pub/sub networks. |

In our view, such centralization is an overlooked risk of smart contracts that underlies well-known smart contract security incidents. Critically, mitigating the known vulnerability of missing permission verification by implementing authorization patterns can in turn introduce centralization. To delineate the issue, we define centralization risk and describe smart contract source code patterns for Ethereum and Algorand that can introduce it to smart contracts. We explain under which circumstances the centralization can be exploited. Finally, we discuss implications of centralization risk for different smart contract stakeholders. |

Those include optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, information oracles, and app-specific chains. This work presents an analysis of layer 2 blockchain strategies determining the optimal times for publishing transactions on the root chain. There is a trade-off between waiting for a better layer 1 gas price and the urgency to finalize layer 2 transactions. We present a model for the problem that captures this trade-off, generalizing previous works, and we analyze the properties of optimal publishing strategies. We show that such optimal strategies hold a computable simple form for a large class of cost functions. |

We perceive Federated Learning as a hierarchical structure, a federation of nodes with validators as the head. The process of validation is done through consensus by employing Novelty Detection and Snowball protocol, to identify valuable and relevant updates while filtering out potentially malicious or irrelevant updates, thus preventing Model Poisoning attacks. The opinion of the validators is recorded in blockchain and trust score is calculated. In case of lack of consensus, trust score is used to determine the impact of validators on the global model. A hyperparameter is introduced to guide the model generation process, either to rely on consensus or on trust score. This approach ensures transparency and reliability in the aggregation process and allows the global model to benefit from insights of most trusted nodes. In the training phase, the combination of IPFS , PGP encryption provides : a) secure and decentralized storage b) mitigates single point of failure making this system reliable and c) resilient against man in the middle attack. The system is realized by implementing in python and Foundry for smart contract development. Global Model is tested against data poisoning by flipping the labels and by introducing malicious nodes. Results found to be similar to that of Flower. |

The future policy of the company is to enlarge the offer of its services to nearby communities that are unable to set up and maintain their own network and software structures. This paper presents thus a possible architecture model to support small municipalities in supplying public services to citizens, with the aid of SED Spa. Through second level platforms based on Blockchain networks and Multi-agents Systems running on smart contracts, the system will focus on Waste Tax (Ta.Ri) management system in the Fascicolo del Cittadino environment. |

In this paper, we introduce a novel notion, the Internet of Responsibilities, for accountability management. Our method sorts through the list of responsibilities with respect to hazardous positions. The positions are interconnected using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) indicating the hierarchy of responsibilities in the organization. In addition, the system detects and collects responsibilities, and represents risk areas in terms of the positions of the responsibility nodes. Finally, an automatic reminder and assignment system is used to enforce a strict responsibility control without human intervention. Using blockchain technology, we further extend our system with the capability to store, recover and encrypt responsibility data. We show that through the application of the Internet of Responsibility network model driven by Big Data, enterprise and government agencies can attain a highly secured and safe workplace. Therefore, our model offers a combination of interconnected responsibilities, accountability, monitoring, and safety which is crucial for the protection of employees and the success of organizations. |
|**2024-02-11**|**zkDFL: An efficient and privacy-preserving decentralized federated learning with zero-knowledge proof**|Mojtaba Ahmadi et.al.|[2312.04579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04579)| Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted in various fields of study and business. Traditional centralized FL systems suffer from serious issues. To address these concerns, decentralized federated learning (DFL) systems have been introduced in recent years. With the help of blockchains, they attempt to achieve more integrity and efficiency. However, privacy preservation remains an uncovered aspect of these systems. To tackle this, as well as to scale the blockchain-based computations, we propose a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based aggregator (zkDFL). This allows clients to share their large-scale model parameters with a trusted centralized server without revealing their individual data to other clients. We utilize blockchain technology to manage the aggregation algorithm via smart contracts. The server performs a ZKP algorithm to prove to the clients that the aggregation is done according to the accepted algorithm. Additionally, the server can prove that all inputs from clients have been used. We evaluate our approach using a public dataset related to the wearable Internet of Things. As demonstrated by numerical evaluations, zkDFL introduces verifiability of the correctness of the aggregation process and enhances the privacy protection and scalability of DFL systems, while the gas cost has significantly declined. |

|**2023-12-07**|**Dynamic Data-Driven Digital Twins for Blockchain Systems**|Georgios Diamantopoulos et.al.|[2312.04226](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04226)| In recent years, we have seen an increase in the adoption of blockchain-based systems in non-financial applications, looking to benefit from what the technology has to offer. Although many fields have managed to include blockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption of blockchain, in general, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-off between decentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous work, we have shown that using a digital twin for dynamically managing blockchain systems during runtime can be effective in managing the trilemma trade-off. Our Digital Twin leverages DDDAS feedback loop, which is responsible for getting the data from the system to the digital twin, conducting optimisation, and updating the physical system. This paper examines how leveraging DDDAS feedback loop can support the optimisation component of the trilemma benefiting from Reinforcement Learning agents and a simulation component to augment the quality of the learned model while reducing the computational overhead required for decision-making. |
|**2023-12-07**|**Contract Wallet Using Emails**|Sora Suegami et.al.|[2312.04173](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04173)| We proposed a new construction for contract wallets, smart contract applications that allow users to control their crypto assets. Users can manipulate their crypto assets by simply sending emails with no need to manage keys. These emails are verified using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) along with their attached digital signatures that the sender domain server (SDS) generates according to DomainKeys Identified Mail. Unless the SDS forges the emails, the crypto assets remain secure in the proposed system. Moreover, the existing SDSs can be used as is by outsourcing additional work to a third party that is not necessarily trusted. The system supports various functions to manipulate crypto assets. We produced a tool for variable-regex mapping (VRM) that enables developers to build a new function without ZKP skills. For example, using the tool, we built a demo application where users can exchange crypto assets via Uniswap only with emails. The published version of this paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC56567.2023.10174932. |

However, DNS is vulnerable to some malicious attacks, including DNS cache poisoning, which redirects users to malicious websites displaying offensive or illegal content. Existing countermeasures often suffer from at least one of the following weakness: weak attack resistance, high overhead, or complex implementation. To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a blockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the forged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution process. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the credibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based incentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation. Importantly, TI-DNS is easy to be adopted as it only requires modifications to the resolver side of current DNS infrastructure. Finally, we develop a prototype and evaluate it against alternative solutions. The result demonstrates that TI-DNS effectively and efficiently solves DNS cache poisoning. |
|**2023-12-05**|**Blockchain Participation Games**|Pyrros Chaidos et.al.|[2312.02769](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02769)| We study game-theoretic models for capturing participation in blockchain systems. Permissionless blockchains can be naturally viewed as games, where a set of potentially interested users is faced with the dilemma of whether to engage with the protocol or not. Engagement here implies that the user will be asked to complete certain tasks, whenever they are selected to contribute (typically according to some stochastic process) and be rewarded if they choose to do so. Apart from the basic dilemma of engaging or not, even more strategic considerations arise in settings where users may be able to declare participation and then retract before completing their tasks (but are still able to receive rewards) or are rewarded independently of whether they contribute. Such variations occur naturally in the blockchain setting due to the complexity of tracking ``on-chain'' the behavior of the participants.   We capture these participation considerations offering a series of models that enable us to reason about the basic dilemma, the case where retraction effects influence the outcome and the case when payments are given universally irrespective of the stochastic process. In all cases we provide characterization results or necessary conditions on the structure of Nash equilibria. Our findings reveal that appropriate reward mechanisms can be used to stimulate participation and avoid negative effects of free riding, results that are in line but also can inform real world blockchain system deployments. |

In the case of many airdrops, tokens are distributed to select users as a "reward" for interacting with the underlying protocol, with a long-term goal of creating a loyal community that will generate genuine economic activity well after the airdrop. Although airdrops are widely used by the blockchain industry, a proper understanding of the factors contributing to an airdrop's success is generally lacking. In this work, we outline the design space for airdrops, and specify a reasonable list of outcomes that an airdrop should ideally result in. We then analyze on-chain data from several larger-scale airdrops to empirically evaluate the success of previous airdrops, with respect to our desiderata. In our analysis, we demonstrate that airdrop farmers frequently dispose of the lion's share of airdrops proceeds via exchanges. Our analysis is followed by an overview of common pitfalls that common airdrop designs lend themselves to, which are then used to suggest concrete guidelines for better airdrops. |

This paper presents MPFUZZ, the first mempool fuzzer to find asymmetric DoS bugs by symbolically exploring mempool state space and optimistically estimating the promisingness an intermediate state is in reaching bug oracles. Compared to the baseline blockchain fuzzers, MPFUZZ achieves a > 100x speedup in finding known DETER exploits. Running MPFUZZ on six major Ethereum clients leads to the discovering of new mempool vulnerabilities, which exhibit a wide variety of sophisticated patterns including stealthy mempool eviction and mempool locking. Rule-based mitigation schemes are proposed against newly discovered vulnerabilities. |

By amalgamating technologies like sensors and cloud computing, the IoV paves the way for optimized traffic management, heightened vehicle safety, and the birth of novel business paradigms. However, this growth is shadowed by significant security concerns, especially in the communication and payment sectors. Addressing the pressing need for secure Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and payments amidst rising cyber threats, this research introduces the Ethereum based Secure Payment and Communication Solution (ESP2CS). Utilizing Ethereum as a middleware, ESP2CS ensures robust and secure V2X interactions. The solution is complemented by an Android Auto application for vehicles, streamlining inter vehicle communication, parking space detection, and transaction management. Furthermore, dedicated Android applications are developed for parking space renters and the parking IoT system. Preliminary evaluations underscore ESP2CS's superior cost effectiveness, integrity and consistency over contemporary solutions, with Ethereum bolstering both security and efficiency. |

The use of blockchain technology in medical Internet of things systems can be considered a safe and novel solution to overcome such challenges. Patients with movement disorders require multi-disciplinary management and must continuously receive medical care from a specialist. Due to the increasing costs of face-to-face treatment, especially during the pandemic, patients would highly benefit from remote monitoring and management. The proposed work presents a model for blockchain-based remote management systems for patients with movement disorders, especially those with Parkinson's disease. The model ensures a high level of integrity and decreases the security risks of medical data sharing. |

Instead of spamming hashing operations to mine blocks, miners will be running Monte Carlo simulations to support a real-world HEP experiment with useful data. The block problems will be defined by a Root Authority which is represented by a HEP experiment like CBM. The focus in this publication is a mechanism that allows the Root Authority to select a winner from a list of nodes that solved a block problem. The mechanism is designed so that winner selection is deterministic, fair and transparent. This mechanism allows every node to verify the fairness of the winner selection process without giving the nodes a tool to be able to improve their own winning chances. |

Due to the transparency of permissionless blockchains, opportunistic traders can compete to earn revenue by extracting Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which undermines both the consensus security and efficiency of blockchain systems. The Flashbots bundle mechanism further aggravates the MEV competition because it empowers opportunistic traders with the capability of designing more sophisticated MEV extraction. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on DeFi MEV activities in Flashbots bundle by developing ActLifter, a novel automated tool for accurately identifying DeFi actions in transactions of each bundle, and ActCluster, a new approach that leverages iterative clustering to facilitate us to discover known/unknown DeFi MEV activities. Extensive experimental results show that ActLifter can achieve nearly 100% precision and recall in DeFi action identification, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, with the help of ActCluster, we obtain many new observations and discover 17 new kinds of DeFi MEV activities, which occur in 53.12% of bundles but have not been reported in existing studies |

Technological advances have brought major improvements to the operations of financial services. While these advances promote improved accessibility and convenience, traditional finance shortcomings like lack of transparency and moral hazard frictions continue to plague centralized platforms, imposing societal costs. In this paper, we argue how these shortcomings and frictions are being mitigated by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We delve into the workings of smart contracts, the backbone of DeFi transactions, with an emphasis on those underpinning token exchange and lending services. We highlight the pros and cons of the novel form of decentralized governance introduced via the ownership of governance tokens. Despite its potential, the current DeFi infrastructure introduces operational risks to users, which we segment into five primary categories: consensus mechanisms, protocol, oracle, frontrunning, and systemic risks. We conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to focus on the scalability of existing blockchains, the improved design and interoperability of DeFi protocols, and the rigorous auditing of smart contracts. |

Lee et.al.|[2312.00902](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00902)| Data science and artificial intelligence have become an indispensable part of scientific research. While such methods rely on high-quality and large quantities of machine-readable scientific data, the current scientific data infrastructure faces significant challenges that limit effective data curation and sharing. These challenges include insufficient return on investment for researchers to share quality data, logistical difficulties in maintaining long-term data repositories, and the absence of standardized methods for evaluating the relative importance of various datasets. To address these issues, this paper presents the Lennard Jones Token, a blockchain-based proof-of-concept solution implemented on the Ethereum network. The token system incentivizes users to submit optimized structures of Lennard Jones particles by offering token rewards, while also charging for access to these valuable structures. Utilizing smart contracts, the system automates the evaluation of submitted data, ensuring that only structures with energies lower than those in the existing database for a given cluster size are rewarded. The paper explores the details of the Lennard Jones Token as a proof of concept and proposes future blockchain-based tokens aimed at enhancing the curation and sharing of scientific data. |

These attacks have one common cause: block withholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates to resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees from miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set of signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has to publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block withholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee election in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a reward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and evaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and double-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the total computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a probability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the success probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal end-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be introduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that prevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety proof. |

Aviation electronics (avionics) systems stand out as the application area of informatics methods in solving aviation problems or providing different capabilities to aircrafts. Avionics systems are electronic systems used in air and space vehicles for many purposes such as surveillance, navigation and communication. In this study, the applicability of blockchain technology as a new approach in the development of avionics systems is discussed, and in this regard, a method inspired by the previously implemented applications in electronic flight systems is proposed to help evaluate the applicability of this technology in new avionics system designs. The potential of blockchain for solving the problems especially in basic services, communication, navigation and flight management systems; the problem structures for which application of this technology would be a reliable solution; and the superiority and inferiority of its use in avionic systems are explained. A guiding paper is proposed for aviation engineers/experts to make a decision on applying blockchain into avionics systems. |

Moreover, the immutability of Blockchain technology makes deployed smart contracts unfixable for the whole life of the Blockchain itself. The lack of complete and up-to-date resources that explain those vulnerabilities in detail has also contributed to increasing the number of vulnerabilities in Blockchain. In addition, the lack of a standardized nomination of the existing vulnerabilities has made redundant research and made developers more confused. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the most complete list of smart contract vulnerabilities that exist in the most popular Blockchains with a detailed explanation of each one of them. In addition, we propose a new codification system that facilitates the communication of those vulnerabilities between developers and researchers. This codification, help identify the most uncovered vulnerabilities to focus on in future research. Moreover, the discussed list of vulnerabilities covers multiple Blockchain and could be used for even future built Blockchains. |

For instance, ChatGPT has attracted more than 100 million users in three months. Since the model training requires a lot of data and computing power, a well-performing deep learning model is behind a huge effort and cost. Facing various model attacks, unauthorized use and abuse from the network that threaten the interests of model owners, in addition to considering legal and other administrative measures, it is equally important to protect the model's copyright from the technical means. By using the model watermarking technology, we point out the possibility of building a unified platform for model ownership verification. Given the application history of blockchain in copyright verification and the drawbacks of a centralized third-party, this paper considers combining model watermarking technology and blockchain to build a unified model copyright protection platform. By a new solution we called Tokenized Model, it protects the model's copyright by reliable ownership record and verification mechanism. It also promotes the financial value of model by constructing the model's transaction process and contribution shares of a model. In the typical case study, we also study the various performance under usual scenario to verify the effectiveness of this platform. |

However, there are two thorny problems caused by unprotected communication methods: "parameter-leakage" and "inefficient-communication". This article proposes Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FBChain) model for federated learning parameter communication to overcome the above two problems. First, we utilize the immutability of blockchain to store the global model and hash value of local model parameters in case of tampering during the communication process, protect data privacy by encrypting parameters, and verify data consistency by comparing the hash values of local parameters, thus addressing the "parameter-leakage" problem. Second, the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm comprehensively selects nodes with the higher weighted link speed to aggregate global model and package blocks, thereby solving the "inefficient-communication" problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FBChain model and its ability to improve model communication efficiency in federated learning. |

The Safe-House is badly needed since there are many ongoing hacks and security concerns in the DeFi space right now. The Safe-House is a piece of engineering sophistication that utilizes existing blockchain principles to bring about greater security when customer assets are moved around. The Safe-House logic is easily implemented as smart contracts on any decentralized system. The amount of funds at risk from both internal and external parties -- and hence the maximum one time loss -- is guaranteed to stay within the specified limits based on cryptographic fundamentals.   To improve the safety of the Safe-House even further, we adapt the one time password (OPT) concept to operate using blockchain technology. Well suited to blockchain cryptographic nuances, our secondary advancement can be termed the one time next time password (OTNTP) mechanism. The OTNTP is designed to complement the Safe-House making it even more safe.   We provide a detailed threat assessment model -- discussing the risks faced by DeFi protocols and the specific risks that apply to blockchain fund management -- and give technical arguments regarding how these threats can be overcome in a robust manner. We discuss how the Safe-House can participate with other external yield generation protocols in a secure way. We provide reasons for why the Safe-House increases safety without sacrificing the efficiency of operation. We start with a high level intuitive description of the landscape, the corresponding problems and our solutions. We then supplement this overview with detailed discussions including the corresponding mathematical formulations and pointers for technological implementation. This approach ensures that the article is accessible to a broad audience. |

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for a blockchain-based decentralized system designed to tackle the escalating challenge of digital content integrity. The proposed system integrates advanced deep learning algorithms with the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where authenticity can be verified without relying on a single centralized authority. Furthermore, the system utilizes smart contracts for dynamic algorithm management and token-based incentives further enhances the system's effectiveness and adaptability. The decentralized architecture of the system democratizes the process of verifying digital content and introduces a novel approach to combat deepfakes. The collaborative and adjustable nature of this system sets a new benchmark for digital media integrity, offering a more robust digital media environment. |

A JIT liquidity provider (LP) monitors pending swap orders in public mempools of blockchains to sandwich orders of their choice with liquidity, depositing right before and withdrawing right after the order. Our game-theoretic model with asymmetrically informed agents reveals that a JIT LP's presence does not always enhance liquidity pool depth, as one might expect. While passive LPs face adverse selection by informed arbitrageurs, a JIT LP's ability to detect pending orders for toxic order flow prior to liquidity provision lets them avoid being adversely selected. JIT LPs thus only provide liquidity to uninformed orders and crowd out passive LPs when order volume is not sufficiently elastic to pool depth, possibly reducing overall market liquidity. We show that using a two-tiered fee structure which transfers a part of a JIT LP's fee revenue to passive LPs or allowing for JIT LPs to compete \`{a} la Cournot are potential solutions to mitigate the negative effects of JIT liquidity. |

It offers a theoretical framework and addresses a critical challenge facing decentralized governance by developing a method to identify Sybils, or spurious identities. Sybils pose significant organizational sustainability threats to DAOs and other, commons-based online communities, and threat models are identified. The experimental method uses an autoencoder architecture and graph deep learning techniques to identify Sybil activity in a DAO governance dataset (snapshot.org). Specifically, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) learned voting behaviours and a fast vector clustering algorithm used high-dimensional embeddings to identify similar nodes in a graph. The results reveal that deep learning can effectively identify Sybils, reducing the voting graph by 2-5%. This research underscores the importance of Sybil resistance in DAOs, identifies challenges and opportunities for forensics and analysis of anonymous networks, and offers a novel perspective on decentralized governance, informing future policy, regulation, and governance practices. |

The rise of blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined evolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting opportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market misconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by addressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by discussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of novel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and taxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis and empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi, shedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we investigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for DeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need enhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the regulatory perimeter. |

Since PCNs only allow path-based transactions, effective, secure routing protocols that find a path between a sender and receiver are fundamental to PCN operations. In this paper, we propose RACED, a routing protocol that leverages the idea of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to route transactions in PCNs in a fast and secure way. Our experiments on real-world transaction datasets show that RACED gives an average transaction success ratio of 98.74%, an average pathfinding time of 31.242 seconds, which is $1.65*10^3$, $1.8*10^3$, and $4*10^2$ times faster than three other recent routing protocols that offer comparable security/privacy properties. We rigorously analyze and prove the security of RACED in the Universal Composability framework. |
|**2023-11-29**|**Emergent Outcomes of the veToken Model**|Thomas Lloyd et.al.|[2311.17589](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17589)| Decentralised organisations use blockchains as a basis for governance: they use on-chain transactions to allocate voting weight, publish proposals, cast votes, and enact the results.   However, blockchain-based governance structures have challenges, mostly notably, the need to align the short-term outlook of pseudononymous voters with the long-term growth and success of the decentralised organisation. The Vote-Escrowed Token (veToken) model attempts to resolve this tension by requiring voters to escrow or lock tokens of value for an extended period in exchange for voting weight.   In this paper, we describe the veToken model and analyse its emergent outcomes. We show that voting behaviour follows bribes set by higher-level protocols, and that the cost per vote varies depending on how it is acquired. We describe the implementation of the veToken model by Curve Finance, a popular automated market maker for stablecoins, and the ecosystem of protocols that has arisen on top of this implementation. We show that voting markets such as Votium largely determine the outcome of fortnightly votes held by Convex Finance, and we show that Frax Finance, a stablecoin issuer, plays a central role in the ecosystem even though they directly lock relatively few tokens with Curve. Instead, they indirectly lock tokens through yield aggregators such as Convex Finance and purchase voting weight through voting markets such as Votium.   Although the veToken model in isolation is straight-forward and easily explained, it leads to many complex and emergent outcomes. Decentralised organisations should consider these outcomes before adopting the model. |

Also, suppose that each participant $P_i$ knows a secret value $x_i\in\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we will propose a protocol that enables the participants in this setup to calculate the value $y=H(m,x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_n)$ of a hash function $H:\mathcal{X}^{n+1}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}$ such that the function $H$ is a one-way function, participants in $P\backslash\{P_i\}$ cannot obtain $x_i$, participants other than the data owner cannot obtain $m$, and the hash value $y=H(m,x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_n)$ remains the same regardless the order of the secret $x_i$ values. |

Interoperability not only enhances the functionality and reach of individual blockchains but also fosters a collaborative environment that can unlock new possibilities for decentralized applications. In this paper, we present Eden, an elastic decentralized envoy network that leverage zero-knowledge MapReduce framework to facilitates ultra-fast and secure cross-chain communication while maintaining complete decentralization. We detail the Eden's design choices, its comprehensive security model, and the innovative mechanisms it incorporates to ensure elasticity and resilience, even under challenging network conditions. |
|**2023-11-29**|**Asynchronous Merkle Trees**|Anoushk Kharangate et.al.|[2311.17441](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17441)| Merkle trees have become a widely successful cryptographic data structure. Enabling a vast variety of applications from checking for inconsistencies in databases like Dynamo to essential tools like Git to large scale distributed systems like Bitcoin and other blockchains. There have also been various versions of Merkle trees like Jellyfish Merkle Trees and Sparse Merkle Trees designed for different applications. However, one key drawback of all these Merkle trees is that with a large data set the cost of computing the tree increases significantly, moreover insert operations on a single leaf require re-building the entire tree. For certain use cases building the tree this way is acceptable, however in environments where compute time needs to be as low as possible and where data is processed in parallel, we are presented with a need for asynchronous computation. This paper proposes a solution where given a batch of data that has to be processed concurrently, a Merkle Tree can be constructed from the batch asynchronously without needing to recalculate the tree for every insert. |
|**2023-11-28**|**Blockchain-based Zero Trust on the Edge**|Cem Bicer et.al.|[2311.16744](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16744)| Internet of Things (IoT) devices pose significant security challenges due to their heterogeneity (i.e., hardware and software) and vulnerability to extensive attack surfaces. Today's conventional perimeter-based systems use credential-based authentication (e.g., username/password, certificates, etc.) to decide whether an actor can access a network. However, the verification process occurs only at the system's perimeter because most IoT devices lack robust security measures due to their limited hardware and software capabilities, making them highly vulnerable. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) extended with blockchain to further enhance security. The blockchain component serves as an immutable database for storing users' requests and is used to verify trustworthiness by analyzing and identifying potentially malicious user activities. We discuss the framework, processes of the approach, and the experiments carried out on a testbed to validate its feasibility and applicability in the smart city context. Lastly, the evaluation focuses on non-functional properties such as performance, scalability, and complexity. |

Therefore, the present work describes MinIndy, a tool designed to simplify the installation and configuration of Hyperledger Indy networks. This simplification will allow people with a lower level of expertise to create their Indy networks. Which makes it a viable alternative for organizations looking to adopt Hyperledger Indy Blockchain networks with less effort. |

Reasons for the difficulty of benchmarking blockchains include, for example, the high number of system parameters to configure and the effort to deploy a blockchain network. In addition, performance data, which mostly comes from system vendors, is often intransparent. We investigate and evaluate the performance of seven permissioned blockchain systems using different parameter settings in a reproducible manner. We employ an end-to-end approach, where the clients sending the transactions are fully involved in the data collection approach. Our results highlight the peculiarities and limitations of the systems under investigation. Due to the insights given, our work forms the basis for continued research to optimise the performance of blockchain systems. |

Contrary to popular belief, it raises security and privacy issues as it is used to collect data from consumers or automated systems. Numerous articles are published that discuss issues like centralised control systems and potential alternatives like integration with blockchain. Although a few recent surveys focused on the challenges and solutions facing the IoT ecosystem, most of them did not concentrate on the threats, difficulties, or blockchain-based solutions. Additionally, none of them focused on blockchain and IoT integration challenges and attacks. In the context of the IoT ecosystem, overall security measures are very important to understand the overall challenges. This article summarises difficulties that have been outlined in numerous recent articles and articulates various attacks and security challenges in a variety of approaches, including blockchain-based solutions and so on. More clearly, this contribution consolidates threats, access control issues, and remedies in brief. In addition, this research has listed some attacks on public blockchain protocols with some real-life examples that can guide researchers in taking preventive measures for IoT use cases. Finally, a future research direction concludes the research gaps by analysing contemporary research contributions. |
|**2023-11-23**|**Forecasting Cryptocurrency Prices Using Deep Learning: Integrating Financial, Blockchain, and Text Data**|Vincent Gurgul et.al.|[2311.14759](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14759)| This paper explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in cryptocurrency price forecasting, specifically Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Focusing on news and social media data, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we analyse the influence of public sentiment on cryptocurrency valuations using advanced deep learning NLP methods. Alongside conventional price regression, we treat cryptocurrency price forecasting as a classification problem. This includes both the prediction of price movements (up or down) and the identification of local extrema. We compare the performance of various ML models, both with and without NLP data integration. Our findings reveal that incorporating NLP data significantly enhances the forecasting performance of our models. We discover that pre-trained models, such as Twitter-RoBERTa and BART MNLI, are highly effective in capturing market sentiment, and that fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) also yields substantial forecasting improvements. Notably, the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model shows considerable proficiency in extracting bullish and bearish signals from textual data. All of our models consistently generate profit across different validation scenarios, with no observed decline in profits or reduction in the impact of NLP data over time. The study highlights the potential of text analysis in improving financial forecasts and demonstrates the effectiveness of various NLP techniques in capturing nuanced market sentiment. |

Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose significant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these attack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities, then strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures their transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included in the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a comprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running attacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter each type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method named FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary Classification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions within decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate classification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement, insertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting front-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%. |

Federated learning (FL) and blockchain technologies have emerged as promising approaches to address these challenges by enabling decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving model training on distributed data sources. In this paper, we present a novel IoT solution that combines the incremental learning vector quantization algorithm (XuILVQ) with Ethereum blockchain technology to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing, model training, and prototype storage in a distributed environment. Our proposed architecture addresses the shortcomings of existing blockchain-based FL solutions by reducing computational and communication overheads while maintaining data privacy and security. We assess the performance of our system through a series of experiments, showcasing its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning tasks in IoT settings. |

It formally characterizes a novel class of distributed objects that only requires a First In First Out (FIFO) order on the object operations from each process (taken individually). The formalization leverages Mazurkiewicz traces to define legal sequences of operations and ensure both Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) and Pipleline Consistency (PC). The paper presents a generic algorithm that implements this novel class of distributed objects both in a crash- and Byzantine setting. It also illustrates the practical interest of the proposed approach using four instances of this class of objects, namely money transfer, Petri nets, multi-sets, and concurrent work stealing dequeues. |

Driven by the latest advances in cutting-edge technologies, Web 3.0 is moving towards a more open, decentralized, intelligent, and interconnected network. However, increasingly widespread data breaches have raised awareness of online privacy and security of personal data. Additionally, since Web 3.0 is a sophisticated and complex convergence, the technical details behind it are not as clear as the characteristics it presents. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth exploration of Web 3.0 from the perspectives of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and edge computing. Specifically, we begin with summarizing the evolution of the Internet and providing an overview of these three key technological factors. Afterward, we provide a thorough analysis of each technology separately, including its relevance to Web 3.0, key technology components, and practical applications. We also propose decentralized storage and computing solutions by exploring the integration of technologies. Finally, we highlight the key challenges alongside potential research directions. Through the combination and mutual complementation of multiple technologies, Web 3.0 is expected to return more control and ownership of data and digital assets back to users. |

Traditional verification techniques fall short in providing comprehensive security assurances, especially against re-entrancy attacks, due to the unavailable implementations of external contracts. This paper introduces an incremental approach: gradual verification. We combine static and dynamic verification techniques to enhance security, guarantee soundness and flexibility, and optimize resource usage in smart contract interactions. By implementing a prototype for gradually verifying Algorand smart contracts via the pyTEAL language, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, contributing to the safe and efficient execution of smart contracts. |
|**2023-11-21**|**Serial Monopoly on Blockchains**|Noam Nisan et.al.|[2311.12731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12731)| We study the following problem that is motivated by Blockchains where ``miners'' are serially given the monopoly for assembling transactions into the next block. Our model has a single good that is sold repeatedly every day where new demand for the good arrives every day. The novel element in our model is that all unsatisfied demand from one day remains in the system and is added to the new demand of the next day. Every day there is a new monopolist that gets to sell a fixed supply $s$ of the good and naturally chooses to do so at the monopolist's price for the combined demand. What will the dynamics of the prices chosen by the sequence of monopolists be? What level of efficiency will be obtained in the long term?   We start with a non-strategic analysis of users' behavior and our main result shows that prices keep fluctuating wildly and this is an endogenous property of the model and happens even when demand is stable with nothing stochastic in the model. These price fluctuations underscore the necessity of an analysis under strategic behavior of the users, which we show results in the prices being stable at the market equilibrium price. |

While this ensures integrity and transparency, the transparent nature of Bitcoin potentially compromises users' privacy rights. To address this concern, users have adopted CoinJoin, a method that amalgamates multiple transaction intents into a single, larger transaction to bolster transactional privacy. This process complicates individual transaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis heuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on identifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin implementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting distinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study delves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming to develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the blockchain. Our exhaustive analysis covers transactions up to block 760,000, offering a comprehensive insight into CoinJoin transactions and their implications for Bitcoin blockchain analysis. |

Given the imminent quantum computing adversarial scenario, conventional cryptographic methods face vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's secure randomness, we adopt post-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for synthesizing pseudo-random sequences. Considering computational costs and resultant on-chain gas costs, we suggest a bifurcated architecture for VRF design, optimizing interactions between on-chain and off-chain. Our approach employs a secure ring signature supported by NIZK proof and a delegated key generation method, inspired by the Chaum-Pedersen equality proof and the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Our VRF scheme integrates multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), ensuring both security and randomness. We elucidate the security and privacy aspects of our VRF scheme, analyzing temporal and spatial complexities. We also approximate the entropy of the VRF scheme and detail its implementation in a Solidity contract. Also, we delineate a method for validating the VRF's proof, matching for the contexts requiring both randomness and verification. Conclusively, using the NIST SP800-22 of the statistical randomness test suite, our results exhibit a 98.86% pass rate over 11 test cases, with an average p-value of 0.5459 from 176 total tests. |

Banks and remittance organisations have shown a growing interest in exploring blockchain's potential advantages over traditional practices. This paper presents a data-driven predictive decision support approach as an innovative artefact designed for the blockchain-oriented remittance industry. Employing a theory-generating Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we have uncovered the emergence of predictive capabilities driven by transactional big data. The artefact integrates predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) to enable real-time remittance monitoring, empowering management decision-makers to address challenges in the uncertain digitised landscape of blockchain-oriented remittance companies. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this research not only enhances the security of the remittance ecosystem but also lays the foundation for future predictive decision support solutions, extending the potential of predictive analytics to other domains. Additionally, the generated theory from the artifact's implementation enriches the DSR approach and fosters grounded and stakeholder theory development in the information systems domain. |

Federated learning lays the groundwork for collaborative research in areas where the data is sensitive. Federated learning has several implications for real-world problems. In times of crisis, when real-time decision-making is critical, federated learning allows multiple entities to work collectively without sharing sensitive data. This distributed approach enables us to leverage information from multiple sources and gain more diverse insights. This paper is a systematic review of the literature on privacy-preserving machine learning in the last few years based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, we have presented an extensive review of supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms, ensemble methods, meta-heuristic approaches, blockchain technology, and reinforcement learning used in the framework of federated learning, in addition to an overview of federated learning applications. This paper reviews the literature on the components of federated learning and its applications in the last few years. The main purpose of this work is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of federated learning from the machine learning point of view. A discussion of some open problems and future research directions in federated learning is also provided. |

However, the increasing transaction volumes and limited on-chain storage underscore scalability as a key challenge hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Fortunately, off-chain networks that enable transactions outside the blockchain show promising potential to mitigate the scalability challenge. Off-chain solutions that address blockchain scalability hurdles, such as payment channel networks, facilitate secure and fast off-chain transactions, thus relieving the main chain's strain. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of key technologies, solutions, and challenges of off-chain networks. First, we introduce the background of off-chain networks encompassing design motivation, framework, overview, and application scenarios. We then review the key issues and technologies associated with off-chain networks. Subsequently, we summarize the mainstream solutions for the corresponding key issues. Finally, we discuss some research challenges and open issues in this area. |

This provides a total ordering on a set of global transactions. However, total ordering is not enough to satisfy application semantics under the Byzantine fault model. This is due to the fact that malicious miners and clients can collaborate to add their own transactions ahead of correct clients' transactions in order to gain application level and financial advantages. These attacks fall under the umbrella of front-running attacks. Therefore, total ordering is not strong enough to preserve application semantics. In this paper, we propose causality preserving total order as a solution to this problem. The resulting Blockchains will be stronger than traditional consensus based blockchains and will provide enhanced security ensuring correct application semantics in a Byzantine setting. |
|**2024-05-05**|**Scalable and Adaptively Secure Any-Trust Distributed Key Generation and All-hands Checkpointing**|Hanwen Feng et.al.|[2311.09592](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09592)| The classical distributed key generation protocols (DKG) are resurging due to their widespread applications in blockchain. While efforts have been made to improve DKG communication, practical large-scale deployments are still yet to come due to various challenges, including the heavy computation and communication (particularly broadcast) overhead in their adversarial cases. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for DLog-based cryptosystems, which achieves (quasi-)linear computation and communication per-node cost with the help of a common coin, even in the face of the maximal amount of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, our protocol is secure against adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt less than half of all nodes. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly operations to an Any-Trust group together with a set of techniques for adaptive security. This group is randomly sampled and consists of a small number of individuals. The population only trusts that at least one member in the group is honest, without knowing which one. Moreover, we present a generic transformer that enables us to efficiently deploy a conventional distributed protocol like our DKG, even when the participants have different weights. Additionally, we introduce an extended broadcast channel based on a blockchain and data dispersal network (such as IPFS), enabling reliable broadcasting of arbitrary-size messages at the cost of constant-size blockchain storage. |

This evaluation was conducted with the recent Diablo benchmark suite, a framework to evaluate the performance of different blockchains on the same ground. By tuning network delays in our controlled environment we were able to reproduce performance trends obtained in geo-distributed settings, hence demonstrating the relevance of bare metal evaluations to better understand blockchain performance. |

Consensus applications include fundamental services for the environments of the Cloud and Blockchain, and in such challenging environments, malicious behaviors are often modeled as adversarial Byzantine faults.   At OPODIS 2010, Mostefaoui and Raynal (in short MR) presented a Byzantine-tolerant solution to consensus in which the decided value cannot be a value proposed only by Byzantine processes. MR has optimal resilience coping with up to t < n/3 Byzantine nodes over n processes. MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from a finite set of values) assuming the availability of a single Binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from the set {0,1}).   This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an even more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine, self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact).   To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution for intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. Our solution has a O(t) stabilization time from arbitrary transient faults. |

However, the underlying infrastructure of this decentralized ecosystem often relies on centralized cloud providers, creating a paradoxical concentration of value and power. This paper investigates the mechanics of value accrual and extraction within the Web3 ecosystem, focusing on the roles and revenues of centralized clouds. Through an analysis of publicly available material, we elucidate the financial implications of cloud services in purportedly decentralized contexts. We further explore the individual's perspective of value creation and accumulation, examining the interplay between user participation and centralized monetization strategies. Key findings indicate that while blockchain technology has the potential to significantly reduce infrastructure costs for financial services, the current Web3 landscape is marked by a substantial reliance on cloud providers for hosting, scalability, and performance. |
|**2024-05-24**|**SeDe: Balancing Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance by Selective De-Anonymization**|Naveen Sahu et.al.|[2311.08167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08167)| Privacy is one of the essential pillars for the widespread adoption of blockchains, but public blockchains are transparent by nature. Modern analytics techniques can easily subdue the pseudonymity feature of a blockchain user. Some applications have been able to provide practical privacy protections using privacy-preserving cryptography techniques. However, malicious actors have abused them illicitly, discouraging honest actors from using privacy-preserving applications as "mixing" user interactions and funds with anonymous bad actors, causing compliance and regulatory concerns.   In this paper, we propose a framework that balances privacy-preserving features by establishing a regulatory and compliant framework called Selective De-Anonymization (SeDe). The adoption of this framework allows privacy-preserving applications on blockchains to de-anonymize illicit transactions by recursive traversal of subgraphs of linked transactions. Our technique achieves this without leaving de-anonymization decisions or control in the hands of a single entity but distributing it among multiple entities while holding them accountable for their respective actions. To instantiate, our framework uses threshold encryption schemes and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). |
|**2023-11-15**|**All Byzantine Agreement Problems are Expensive**|Pierre Civit et.al.|[2311.08060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08060)| Byzantine agreement, arguably the most fundamental problem in distributed computing, operates among n processes, out of which t < n can exhibit arbitrary failures. The problem states that all correct (non-faulty) processes must eventually decide (termination) the same value (agreement) from a set of admissible values defined by the proposals of the processes (validity). Depending on the exact version of the validity property, Byzantine agreement comes in different forms, from Byzantine broadcast to strong and weak consensus, to modern variants of the problem introduced in today's blockchain systems. Regardless of the specific flavor of the agreement problem, its communication cost is a fundamental metric whose improvement has been the focus of decades of research. The Dolev-Reischuk bound, one of the most celebrated results in distributed computing, proved 40 years ago that, at least for Byzantine broadcast, no deterministic solution can do better than Omega(t^2) exchanged messages in the worst case. Since then, it remained unknown whether the quadratic lower bound extends to seemingly weaker variants of Byzantine agreement. This paper answers the question in the affirmative, closing this long-standing open problem. Namely, we prove that any non-trivial agreement problem requires Omega(t^2) messages to be exchanged in the worst case. To prove the general lower bound, we determine the weakest Byzantine agreement problem and show, via a novel indistinguishability argument, that it incurs Omega(t^2) exchanged messages. |

To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making and blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message exchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message broadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission delay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network. Therefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed structure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach consistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus cannot be directly deployed. This article reviews several existing consensus mechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms that apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in CAS. To deploy wireless-adapted consensus, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based message structure to build a non-equivocation data dissemination protocol for CAS, which has resilience against message loss and unpredictable forwarding latency. Finally, we enhance this protocol by developing a two-dimension DAG-based strategy to achieve partial order for blockchain and total order for the distributed service model SMR. |

In this paper we propose a softmax aggregation blockchain based federated learning framework. First, we propose a new blockchain based federated learning architecture that utilizes the well-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on an existing blockchain network to select validators and miners to aggregate the participants' updates and compute the blocks. Second, to ensure the robustness of the aggregation process, we design a novel softmax aggregation method based on approximated population loss values that relies on our specific blockchain architecture. Additionally, we show our softmax aggregation technique converges to the global minimum in the convex setting with non-restricting assumptions. Our comprehensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing robust aggregation algorithms in various settings by large margins. |
|**2023-11-10**|**Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Approach for Vehicular Networks**|Shirin Sultana et.al.|[2311.06372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06372)| Data from interconnected vehicles may contain sensitive information such as location, driving behavior, personal identifiers, etc. Without adequate safeguards, sharing this data jeopardizes data privacy and system security. The current centralized data-sharing paradigm in these systems raises particular concerns about data privacy. Recognizing these challenges, the shift towards decentralized interactions in technology, as echoed by the principles of Industry 5.0, becomes paramount. This work is closely aligned with these principles, emphasizing decentralized, human-centric, and secure technological interactions in an interconnected vehicular ecosystem. To embody this, we propose a practical approach that merges two emerging technologies: Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain. The integration of these technologies enables the creation of a decentralized vehicular network. In this setting, vehicles can learn from each other without compromising privacy while also ensuring data integrity and accountability. Initial experiments show that compared to conventional decentralized federated learning techniques, our proposed approach significantly enhances the performance and security of vehicular networks. The system's accuracy stands at 91.92\%. While this may appear to be low in comparison to state-of-the-art federated learning models, our work is noteworthy because, unlike others, it was achieved in a malicious vehicle setting. Despite the challenging environment, our method maintains high accuracy, making it a competent solution for preserving data privacy in vehicular networks. |
|**2023-11-10**|**Deep Learning meets Blockchain for Automated and Secure Access Control**|Asma Jodeiri Akbarfam et.al.|[2311.06236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06236)| Access control is a critical component of computer security, governing access to system resources. However, designing policies and roles in traditional access control can be challenging and difficult to maintain in dynamic and complex systems, which is particularly problematic for organizations with numerous resources. Furthermore, traditional methods suffer from issues such as third-party involvement, inefficiency, and privacy gaps, making transparent and dynamic access control an ongoing research problem. Moreover detecting malicious activities and identifying users who are not behaving appropriately can present notable difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose DLACB, a Deep Learning Based Access Control Using Blockchain, as a solution to decentralized access control. DLACB uses blockchain to provide transparency, traceability, and reliability in various domains such as medicine, finance, and government while taking advantage of deep learning to not rely on predefined policies and eventually automate access control. With the integration of blockchain and deep learning for access control, DLACB can provide a general framework applicable to various domains, enabling transparent and reliable logging of all transactions. As all data is recorded on the blockchain, we have the capability to identify malicious activities. We store a list of malicious activities in the storage system and employ a verification algorithm to cross-reference it with the blockchain. We conduct measurements and comparisons of the smart contract processing time for the deployed access control system in contrast to traditional access control methods, determining the time overhead involved. The processing time of DLBAC demonstrates remarkable stability when exposed to increased request volumes. |

Fries et.al.|[2311.05966](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05966)| We propose a lean and functional transaction scheme to establish a secure delivery-versus-payment across two blockchains, where a) no intermediary is required and b) the operator of the payment chain/payment system has a small overhead and does not need to store state. The main idea comes with two requirements: First, the payment chain operator hosts a stateless decryption service that allows decrypting messages with his secret key. Second, a "Payment Contract" is deployed on the payment chain that implements a function transferAndDecrypt(uint id, address from, address to, string keyEncryptedSuccess, string keyEncryptedFail) that processes the (trigger-based) payment and emits the decrypted key depending on the success or failure of the transaction. The respective key can then trigger an associated transaction, e.g. claiming delivery by the buyer or re-claiming the locked asset by the seller. |

Such attention is a consequence of the revenue that can be generated from MEV, as well as the risks MEV poses to the fundamental value proposition of the underlying blockchain technology. In this work, we provide an information-theoretic formulation of MEV. With this formulation, we make common statements about MEV mathematically rigorous. For example, we show that i) all non-trivial blockchains and decentralised applications must generate MEV; ii) how MEV can be reduced at the expense of user expressibility; and iii) how MEV can be good or bad from an information theoretic standpoint. |

Tackling scalability while preserving the security and decentralization of the network is a significant challenge. To deliver effective scaling solutions, Ethereum achieved a major protocol improvement, including a change in the consensus mechanism towards Proof of Stake. This improvement aimed a vast reduction of the hardware requirements to run a node, leading to significant sustainability benefits with a lower network energy consumption. This work analyzes the resource usage behavior of different clients running as Ethereum consensus nodes, comparing their performance under different configurations and analyzing their differences. Our results show higher requirements than claimed initially and how different clients react to network perturbations. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between the consensus clients, including their strong points and limitations. |

|**2023-11-07**|**Generalized Hybrid Search and Applications to Blockchain and Hash Function Security**|Alexandru Cojocaru et.al.|[2311.03723](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03723)| In this work we first examine the hardness of solving various search problems by hybrid quantum-classical strategies, namely, by algorithms that have both quantum and classical capabilities. We then construct a hybrid quantum-classical search algorithm and analyze its success probability. Regarding the former, for search problems that are allowed to have multiple solutions and in which the input is sampled according to arbitrary distributions we establish their hybrid quantum-classical query complexities -- i.e., given a fixed number of classical and quantum queries, determine what is the probability of solving the search task. At a technical level, our results generalize the framework for hybrid quantum-classical search algorithms proposed by Rosmanis. Namely, for an arbitrary distribution $D$ on Boolean functions, the probability an algorithm equipped with $\tau_c$ classical and $\tau_q$ quantum queries succeeds in finding a preimage of $1$ for a function sampled from $D$ is at most $\nu_D \cdot(2\sqrt{\tau_c} + 2\tau_q + 1)^2$, where $\nu_D$ captures the average (over $D$) fraction of preimages of $1$. As applications of our hardness results, we first revisit and generalize the security of the Bitcoin protocol called the Bitcoin backbone, to a setting where the adversary has both quantum and classical capabilities, presenting a new hybrid honest majority condition necessary for the protocol to properly operate. Secondly, we examine the generic security of hash functions against hybrid adversaries. Regarding our second contribution, we design a hybrid algorithm which first spends all of its classical queries and in the second stage runs a ``modified Grover'' where the initial state depends on the distribution $D$ . We show how to analyze its success probability for arbitrary target distributions and, importantly, its optimality for the uniform and the Bernoulli distribution cases. |

This paper explores how smart contracts and blockchain can be used to create a transparent and secure ledger for tracking charitable donations. We highlight the limitations of traditional donation systems and how a blockchain-based system can help overcome these challenges. The functionality of smart contracts in donation tracking, offering advantages such as automation, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced accountability, is elucidated. The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology is emphasized for increased transparency and fraud prevention. While elucidating the benefits, we also address challenges in implementing such a system, including the need for technical expertise and security considerations. By fostering trust and accountability, a donation-tracking system in Web 3.0, empowered by smart blockchain networks, aims to catalyze a profound positive impact in the realm of philanthropy. |

The dynamics of ledger's development can be mathematically represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this paper, we study a DAG model which considers batch arrivals and random delay of attachment. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of this model by letting the arrival rate goes to infinity and the inter arrival time goes to zero. We establish that the number of leaves in the DAG and various random variables characterizing the vertices in the DAG can be approximated by its fluid limit, represented as delayed partial differential equations. Furthermore, we establish the stable state of this fluid limit and validate our findings through simulations. |

Many scholars are dedicated to improving its verifiability, scalability, and performance based on sharding techniques, including grouping nodes and handling cross-shard transactions. However, they ignore the node vulnerability problem, i.e., there is no guarantee that nodes will not be maliciously controlled throughout their life cycle. Facing this challenge, we propose RecAGT, a novel identification scheme aimed at reducing communication overhead and identifying potential malicious nodes. First, shard testable codes are designed to encode the original data in case of a leak of confidential data. Second, a new identity proof protocol is presented as evidence against malicious behavior. Finally, adaptive group testing is chosen to identify malicious nodes. Notably, our work focuses on the internal operation within the committee and can thus be applied to any sharding permissioned blockchains. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can effectively identify malicious nodes with low communication and computational costs. |

In this article, we investigate the decentralization in the governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) using the Gini coefficient as an indicator of inequality among the token owners. This metric is analyzed in the context of Return on Investment (ROI) for companies in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Our goal is to understand whether the level of "real" decentralization in blockchain-based governance affects financial efficiency, and to explore the benefits and possible limitations of such an approach. This analysis allows for a deeper understanding of the significance and impact of decentralization on the functioning and productivity of organizations in the DeFi sector, and to determine the extent to which this impact is positively or negatively reflected in their success and profitability. Additionally, the results of this analysis will provide a fuller understanding of the dynamics and potential of blockchain for organization governance. |

It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances. |

The blockchain (BC) guarantees task-offloading privacy, but cost reduction, queueing delays, and redundancy elimination remain open problems. This paper presents a redundancy-aware BC-based approach for the metaverse's partial computation offloading (PCO). Specifically, we formulate a joint BC redundancy factor (BRF) and PCO problem to minimize computation costs, maximize incentives, and meet delay and BC offloading constraints. We proved this problem is NP-hard and transformed it into two subproblems based on their temporal correlation: real-time PCO and Markov decision process-based BRF. We formulated the PCO problem as a multiuser game, proposed a decentralized algorithm for Nash equilibrium under any BC redundancy state, and designed a double deep Q-network-based algorithm for the optimal BRF policy. The BRF strategy is updated periodically based on user computation demand and network status to assist the PCO algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing schemes, resulting in a remarkable 47% reduction in cost overhead, delivering approximately 64% higher rewards, and achieving convergence in just a few training episodes. |

In particular, the "Superbonus 110" tax relief in 2020, offering a generous 110% deduction for expenses related to energy efficiency improvements and seismic risk reduction in buildings, has played a pivotal role. However, the surge in construction activities has also brought about an unfortunate increase in fraudulent activities. To address this challenge, our research introduces a practical system for monitoring and managing the entire process of the Superbonus 110 tax credit, from its initiation to redemption. This system leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to streamline tax credit management and incorporates controllers based on a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation architecture, bolstered by a Multi-agent System. The outcome of our work is a system capable of establishing a tokenomics framework that caters to the needs and functionalities of both investors and operators. Moreover, it features a robust control system to prevent inadvertent errors like double spending, overspending, and deceitful practices such as false claims of completed work. The collaborative approach between the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation and the Multi-agent System enhances trust and security levels among participants in a competitive environment where potential fraudsters might attempt to exploit the system. It also enables comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the entire Superbonus process. In the realm of engineering, our project represents an innovative fusion of blockchain technology and Multi-agent Systems, advancing the application of artificial intelligence. This integration guarantees the validation, recording, and execution of transactions with a remarkable level of trust and transparency. |

While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of their governance mechanisms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research articles, we develop a taxonomy to categorize these governance issues. We collect and build a dataset of 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies, categorizing their governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. We conducted a thorough analysis of governance issues and identified vulnerabilities in governance design and implementation, e.g., voting sybil attack and proposal front-running. Our findings highlight a significant observation: the disparity between smart contract code and DeFi whitepapers plays a central role in these governance issues. As an initial step to address the challenges of code-whitepaper consistency checks for DeFi applications, we built a machine-learning-based prototype, and validated its performance on eight widely used DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Our study culminates in providing several key practical implications for various DeFi stakeholders, including developers, users, researchers, and regulators, aiming to deepen the understanding of DeFi governance issues and contribute to the robust growth of DeFi systems. |

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis remains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized expert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted data.   Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise predictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data repositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent privacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution harnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy, facilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI analysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection architecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various issues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI images.   Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly on the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost constraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain securely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our decentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease predictions. By merging the strengths of blockchain, AI, and anomaly detection, our system represents a pioneering step towards revolutionizing disease diagnostics. |

Ever since the inception of Bitcoin, blockchain teams have incorporated the concept of open source code as a fundamental principle, thus making the majority of blockchain-based projects' code and version control data available for analysis. We define health in open source software projects to be a combination of the concepts of sustainability, robustness, and niche occupation. Sustainability is further divided into interest and engagement. This work uses exploratory factor analysis to identify latent constructs that are representative of general public interest or popularity in software, and software robustness within open source blockchain projects. We find that interest is a combination of stars, forks, and text mentions in the GitHub repository, while a second factor for robustness is composed of a criticality score, time since last updated, numerical rank, and geographic distribution. Cross validation of the dataset is carried out with good support for the model. A structural model of software health is proposed such that general interest positively influences developer engagement, which, in turn, positively predicts software robustness. The implications of structural equation modelling in the context of software engineering and next steps are discussed. |

Our strategy involves developing blockchain-based NFT certifications that can be shared with institutions or employers using blockchain addresses. Students may access the data created by each individual institute in a single platform, filter the view of the relevant courses according to their requirements, and mint their certificate metadata as NFTs. This method provides accountability of access, comprehensive records that are permanently maintained in IPFS, and verifiable provenance for creating, distributing, and accessing certificates. It also makes it possible to share certificates more safely and efficiently. By incorporating trust factors through data provenance, our system provides a countermeasure against issues such as fake and duplicate certificates. It addresses the challenge of the traditional certificate verification processes, which are lengthy manual process. With this system, students can manage and validate their academic credentials from multiple institutions in one location while ensuring authenticity and confidentiality using digital signatures and hashing for data protection against unauthorized access. Overall, our suggested system ensures data safety, accountability, and confidentiality while offering a novel approach to certificate distribution. |

Maciel et.al.|[2310.19999](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19999)| Interoperability has been a focus of attention over at least four decades, with the emergence of several interoperability types (or levels), diverse models, frameworks, and solutions, also as a result of a continuous effort from different domains. The current heterogeneity in technologies such as blockchain, IoT and new application domains such as Industry 4.0 brings not only new interaction possibilities but also challenges for interoperability. Moreover, confusion and ambiguity in the current understanding of interoperability types exist, hampering stakeholders' communication and decision making. This work presents an updated panorama of software-intensive systems interoperability with particular attention to its types. For this, we conducted a tertiary study that scrutinized 37 secondary studies published from 2012 to 2023, from which we found 36 interoperability types associated with 117 different definitions, besides 13 interoperability models and six frameworks in various domains. This panorama reveals that the concern with interoperability has migrated from technical to social-technical issues going beyond the software systems' boundary and still requiring solving many open issues. We also address the urgent actions and also potential research opportunities to leverage interoperability as a multidisciplinary research field to achieve low-coupled, cost-effective, and interoperable systems. |

In the present work we study capitalization, floor price, the number of transactions, the inter-transaction times, and the transaction volume value of a few selected popular token collections. The results show that the fluctuations of all these quantities are characterized by heavy-tailed probability distribution functions, in most cases well described by the stretched exponentials, with a trace of power-law scaling at times, long-range memory, and in several cases even the fractal organization of fluctuations, mostly restricted to the larger fluctuations, however. We conclude that the NFT market - even though young and governed by a somewhat different mechanisms of trading - shares several statistical properties with the regular financial markets. However, some differences are visible in the specific quantitative indicators. |

Existing methods typically record transactions happening in a supply chain on a single blockchain and are limited in their ability to deal with different levels of data visibility. To address this limitation, we present FoodFresh -- a multi-chain consortium where organizations store immutable data on their blockchains. A decentralized hub coordinates the cross-chain exchange of digital assets among the heterogeneous blockchains. Mechanisms for enabling blockchain interoperability help to preserve the benefits of independent sovereign blockchains while allowing for data sharing across blockchain boundaries. |

Traditional authentication methods are no longer considered reliable due to their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Biometric authentication, particularly fingerprint authentication, has emerged as a promising alternative, but it raises concerns about the storage and use of biometric data, as well as centralized storage, which could make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based fingerprint authentication system is proposed that integrates zk-SNARKs, which are zero-knowledge proofs that enable secure and efficient authentication without revealing sensitive biometric information. A KNN-based approach on the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets is used to generate a cancelable template for secure, faster, and robust biometric registration and authentication which is stored using the Interplanetary File System. The proposed approach provides an average accuracy of 99.01%, 98.97% and 98.52% over the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets respectively for fingerprint authentication. Incorporation of zk-SNARK facilitates smaller proof size. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to provide a secure and efficient solution for blockchain-based identity management. |

A secured identity management system ensures both security and the efficient provision of services for the host nation and the donor organizations. Realizing the benefits, a handful of studies enriched the blockchain-based security identification for refugees. The research studies presented the introductory, conceptual, and practical solution related to the blockchain-based smart contract. There is a common agreement in the studies that blockchain-based smart contract not only streamlines refugee identity verification but also safeguards against unauthorized entries. Since it is a technology as well, it has been essential to know the present status of the technology in the social context. In such a situation it becomes essential to review the existing research studies to provide insight for future studies. In this study, we reviewed current studies using a thematic approach. Our findings suggest researchers are more inclined to provide conceptual models as the models are important in advancing technology; however, the models need to be implemented for practical advances. However, the main contribution of this study is that this study gathers current efforts in smart contract-based refugee identity management. This study is important for the refugee host nations as well as for stakeholders. Knowledge gained from the study is expected to provide insight into how the technology can be developed using existing theory and implementation frameworks. |

This paper proposes a theoretical framework for creating a blockchain-based digital entity to facilitate telemedicine services. The proposed framework utilizes blockchain technology to provide a secure and reliable platform for medical practitioners to remotely interact with patient transactions. The blockchain will serve as a one-stop digital service to secure patient data, ensure privacy, and facilitate payments. The proposed framework leverages the existing Hyperledger Fabric platform to build a secure blockchain-assisted telemedicine platform. |

Jeenath Laila et.al.|[2310.18668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18668)| In the digital age, it is crucial to make sure that financial transactions are as secure and reliable as possible. This abstract offers a ground-breaking method that combines smart contracts, blockchain technology, FaceNet512 for improved face recognition, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for speech authentication to create a system for video and audio verification that is unmatched. Smart contracts and the immutable ledger of the blockchain are combined to offer a safe and open environment for financial transactions. FaceNet512 and GMM offer multi-factor biometric authentication simultaneously, enhancing security to new heights. By combining cutting-edge technology, this system offers a strong defense against identity theft and illegal access, establishing a new benchmark for safe financial transactions. |

Understanding the Security of Coin-based Voting Governance**|Chao Li et.al.|[2310.18596](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18596)| Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model. |

By integrating GAI into modern Internet of Things (IoT), Generative Internet of Things (GIoT) is emerging and holds immense potential to revolutionize various aspects of society, enabling more efficient and intelligent IoT applications, such as smart surveillance and voice assistants. In this article, we present the concept of GIoT and conduct an exploration of its potential prospects. Specifically, we first overview four GAI techniques and investigate promising GIoT applications. Then, we elaborate on the main challenges in enabling GIoT and propose a general GAI-based secure incentive mechanism framework to address them, in which we adopt Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) for incentive mechanism designs and apply blockchain technologies for secure GIoT management. Moreover, we conduct a case study on modern Internet of Vehicle traffic monitoring, which utilizes GDMs to generate effective contracts for incentivizing users to contribute sensing data with high quality. Finally, we suggest several open directions worth investigating for the future popularity of GIoT. |
|**2024-05-06**|**Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus**|Same Blackshear et.al.|[2310.18042](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18042)| Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration. |

As a virtual world independent of the real world, the metaverse will provide users with a variety of virtual activities that bring great convenience to society. In addition, the metaverse can facilitate digital twins, which offers transformative possibilities for the industry. Thus, the metaverse has attracted the attention of the industry, and a huge amount of capital is about to be invested. However, the development of the metaverse is still in its infancy and little research has been undertaken so far. We describe the development of the metaverse. Next, we introduce the architecture of the socially beneficial metaverse (SB-Metaverse) and we focus on the technologies that support the operation of SB-Metaverse. In addition, we also present the applications of SB-Metaverse. Finally, we discuss several challenges faced by SB-Metaverse which must be addressed in the future. |

To collect relevant insights into systems' behavior, we observe many evaluation frameworks focusing mainly on the system under test throughput. However, these frameworks often need more comprehensiveness and generality, particularly in adopting a distributed applications' cross-layer approach. This work analyses in detail the requirements for distributed systems assessment. We summarize these findings into a structured methodology and experimentation framework called METHODA. Our approach emphasizes setting up and assessing a broader spectrum of distributed systems and addresses a notable research gap. We showcase the effectiveness of the framework by evaluating four distinct systems and their interaction, leveraging a diverse set of eight carefully selected metrics and 12 essential parameters. Through experimentation and analysis we demonstrate the framework's capabilities to provide valuable insights across various use cases. For instance, we identify that a combination of Trusted Execution Environments with threshold signature scheme FROST introduces minimal overhead on the performance with average latency around \SI{40}{\ms}. We showcase an emulation of realistic systems behavior, e.g., Maximal Extractable Value is possible and could be used to further model such dynamics. The METHODA framework enables a deeper understanding of distributed systems and is a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners navigating the complex landscape of modern computing infrastructures. |

However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures. |

However, achieving consensus among nodes and packaging blocks in blockchain networks is a complex task that requires efficient and secure consensus algorithms. The DPoS consensus algorithm has emerged as a popular choice due to its fast transaction processing and high throughput. Despite these advantages, the algorithm still suffers from weaknesses such as centralization and vulnerability to long-range attacks, which can compromise the integrity of the blockchain network.   To combat these problems, we developed an Enhanced Anti-Long-Range Attack DPoS algorithm (HL-DPoS). First, we split nodes into pieces to reduce centralization issues while giving witness nodes the power to report and benefit from malicious node's reports, maintaining high efficiency and high security. Second, we propose a validation method in HL-DPoS that compares consensuses transactions with the longest chain to detect long-range attacks. Algorithm analysis and simulation experiment results demonstrate that our HL-DPoS consensus algorithm improves security while achieving better consensus performance. |

However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized FL server. This article proposed a bi-level blockchained architecture for secure federated learning-based traffic prediction. The bottom and top layer blockchain store the local model and global aggregated parameters accordingly, and the distributed homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging (DHFA) scheme addresses the secure computation problems. We propose the partial private key distribution protocol and a partially homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme to achieve the distributed privacy-preserving federated averaging model. We conduct extensive experiments to measure the running time of DHFA operations, quantify the read and write performance of the blockchain network, and elucidate the impacts of varying regional group sizes and model complexities on the resulting prediction accuracy for the online traffic flow prediction task. The results indicate that the proposed system can facilitate secure and decentralized federated learning for real-world traffic prediction tasks. |

Kamkuemah et.al.|[2310.14600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14600)| Non-fungible tokens, NFT, have been used to record ownership of real estate, art, digital assets, and more recently to serve legal notice. They provide an important and accessible non-financial use of cryptocurrency's blockchain but are peculiar because ownership by NFT confers no rights over the asset. This work shows that it is possible to specify that peculiar property by combining functional and epistemic properties. Suitability of the specification is evaluated by proof that the blockchain implementation conforms to it, and by its use in an analysis of serving legal notice. |

Federated learning, which stores data in distributed nodes and shares only model parameters, has gained significant attention for addressing this concern. However, a challenge arises in federated learning due to the Byzantine Attack Problem, where malicious local models can compromise the global model's performance during aggregation. This article proposes the Blockchain-based Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning (BRLF) model that combines federated learning with blockchain technology. This integration enables traceability of malicious models and provides incentives for locally trained clients. Our approach involves selecting the aggregation node based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, and we perform spectral clustering and calculate the average gradient within each cluster, validating its accuracy using local dataset of the aggregation nodes. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superior byzantine robustness of our secure aggregation algorithm compared to other baseline byzantine robust aggregation methods, and proved our proposed model effectiveness in addressing the resource consumption problem. |

As the sentiment expressed on social media platforms can significantly influence cryptocurrency discussions and market movements, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and predicting market trends. Motivated by the aim to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy in the cryptocurrency domain, this paper investigates fine-tuning techniques on large language models. This paper also investigates the efficacy of supervised fine-tuning and instruction-based fine-tuning on large language models for unseen tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a significant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% after fine-tuning, highlighting the potential of this technique in optimizing pre-trained language model efficiency. Additionally, the impact of instruction tuning on models of varying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from instruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In contrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to the complete utilization of model capacity. To gain deeper insight about how instruction works with these language models, this paper presents an experimental investigation into the response of an instruction-based model under different instruction tuning setups. The investigation demonstrates that the model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple instructions. This performance significantly outperforms its accuracy under long and complex instructions by over 12%, thereby effectively highlighting the profound significance of instruction characteristics in maximizing model performance. |

Buoyed by the excitement around secure decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies, the last decade has witnessed numerous constructions of TLP variants and related applications (e.g., cost-efficient blockchain designs, randomness beacons, e-voting, etc.).   In this poster, we first extend the notion of TLP by formally defining the "time-lock public key encryption" (TLPKE) scheme. Next, we introduce and construct a "tight short-lived signatures" scheme using our TLPKE.

This article proposes the conceptual model called PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two main components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data curation/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the private training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its applicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the existing model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we employed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or randomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively evaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of public database and resources, during each update when new information is added for training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy for private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain, private information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures such as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy vs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and obfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely, the use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational complexity and high training latency. We believe that the proposed model could be used as a benchmark for proposing privacy preserving LLMs for generative AI tools. |

In this paper, we introduce VDKMS (Vehicular Decentralized Key Management System), a novel Decentralized Key Management System designed specifically as an infrastructure for Cellular Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) networks, utilizing a blockchain-based approach. The proposed VDKMS addresses the challenges of secure communication, privacy preservation, and efficient key management in V2X scenarios. It integrates blockchain technology, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to enable secure and trustworthy V2X applications among vehicles, infrastructures, and networks. We first provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components, protocols, and workflows, covering aspects such as provisioning, registration, verification, and authorization. We then present a detailed performance evaluation, discussing the security properties and compatibility of the proposed solution, as well as a security analysis. Finally, we present potential applications in the vehicular ecosystem that can leverage the advantages of our approach. |

Despite the ubiquity of these graphs in real-world scenarios, it's usually impractical for us to obtain the whole real-time graphs due to privacy concerns and technical limitations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of {\it Live Graph Lab} for temporal graphs, which enables open, dynamic and real transaction graphs from blockchains. Among them, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most prominent parts of blockchain over the past several years. With more than \$40 billion market capitalization, this decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction activities, which naturally forms a complicated transaction network. However, there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its dynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of measurements are presented to understand the properties of the NFT ecosystem. Through comparisons with social, citation, and web networks, our analyses give intriguing findings and point out potential directions for future exploration. Finally, we also study machine learning models in this live graph to enrich the current datasets and provide new opportunities for the graph community. The source codes and dataset are available at https://livegraphlab.github.io. |

This voluminous data stream requires a significant amount of network bandwidth and extensive storage infrastructure. Additionally, local data processing demands substantial manpower and hardware investments. Data isolation across different healthcare institutions hinders cross-institutional collaboration in clinics and research. In this work, we anticipate an innovative MRI system and its four generations that integrate emerging distributed cloud computing, 6G bandwidth, edge computing, federated learning, and blockchain technology. This system is called Cloud-MRI, aiming at solving the problems of MRI data storage security, transmission speed, AI algorithm maintenance, hardware upgrading, and collaborative work. The workflow commences with the transformation of k-space raw data into the standardized Imaging Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Raw Data (ISMRMRD) format. Then, the data are uploaded to the cloud or edge nodes for fast image reconstruction, neural network training, and automatic analysis. Then, the outcomes are seamlessly transmitted to clinics or research institutes for diagnosis and other services. The Cloud-MRI system will save the raw imaging data, reduce the risk of data loss, facilitate inter-institutional medical collaboration, and finally improve diagnostic accuracy and work efficiency. |

Existing protocols overlook diverse adversarial attacks, limiting transaction throughput. This paper presents Reticulum, a groundbreaking sharding protocol addressing this issue, boosting blockchain scalability.   Reticulum employs a two-phase approach, adapting transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks. It comprises "control" and "process" shards in two layers. Process shards contain at least one trustworthy node, while control shards have a majority of trusted nodes. In the first phase, transactions are written to blocks and voted on by nodes in process shards. Unanimously accepted blocks are confirmed. In the second phase, blocks without unanimous acceptance are voted on by control shards. Blocks are accepted if the majority votes in favor, eliminating first-phase opponents and silent voters. Reticulum uses unanimous voting in the first phase, involving fewer nodes, enabling more parallel process shards. Control shards finalize decisions and resolve disputes.   Experiments confirm Reticulum's innovative design, providing high transaction throughput and robustness against various network attacks, outperforming existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks. |

This shift is characterized by the need to accommodate dynamic participation, contrasting the traditional approach of a static set of continuously online participants. Works like Bitcoin and the Sleepy Model have set the stage for this developing framework.   Notable contributions from Momose and Ren (CCS 2022) and subsequent works have introduced Total-Order Broadcast protocols leveraging Graded Agreement primitives and supporting dynamic participation, though often requiring multiple rounds of voting per decision -- a potential bottleneck for real-world large-scale systems.   Addressing this, our paper presents a novel Total-Order Broadcast protocol in the Sleepy Model resilient to up to 1/2 adversarial participants, requiring just a single round of voting per decision. This work paves the way to more practical Total-Order Broadcast protocols to be implemented in real-world systems where a large number of participants are involved simultaneously and their participation level might fluctuate over time. |

It presents a comprehensive risk management framework developed in collaboration with financial institutions, blockchain development teams and regulators that applies a traditional risk management taxonomy to address certain overlooked blockchain protocol risks. The approach offers a structured way to identify, measure, monitor and report blockchain protocol risks. The paper provides real-world use cases to demonstrate the practicality and implementation of the proposed framework. The findings of this work contribute to the evolving understanding of blockchain protocol risks and provide valuable insights on how these risks affect the adoption of DLT by financial institutions. |
|**2023-10-16**|**Towards Scalable Cross-Chain Messaging**|Joao Otavio Chervinski et.al.|[2310.10016](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10016)| Blockchains were originally designed as closed execution environments and lack the ability to communicate directly with external systems. To overcome this limitation, many blockchains employ relayers, external applications capable of transporting data between different blockchains. Typically, the process of relaying data is permissionless and multiple independent relayers work concurrently to transport the same information between two blockchains. While this model increases the reliability of data delivery by providing redundancy, it also introduces challenges that have not been previously discussed. In this work, we bridge this gap by discussing the shortcomings of permissionless cross-chain relaying systems and identifying three issues that adversely impact their performance, scalability and security. We take the first step towards addressing issues that hinder performance and scalability by proposing a novel protocol to enable coordination among independent relayers. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion about the trade-offs associated with the design of relayer coordination protocols for permissionless settings. Through this work we provide a foundation for improving cross-chain relaying services. |

With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel light-weight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We also dive into the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with Non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. The experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm. |

Jalalzai et.al.|[2310.09663](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09663)| Low latency is one of the most desirable features of partially synchronous Byzantine consensus protocols. Existing low-latency protocols have achieved consensus with just two communication steps by reducing the maximum number of faults the protocol can tolerate (from $f = \frac{n-1}{3}$ to $f = \frac{n+1}{5}$), \textcolor{black}{by relaxing protocol safety guarantees}, or by using trusted hardware like Trusted Execution Environment. Furthermore, these two-step protocols don't support rotating leaders and low-cost view change (leader replacement), which are important features of many blockchain use cases. In this paper, we propose a protocol called VBFT which achieves consensus in just two communication steps without sacrificing desirable features. In particular, VBFT tolerates $f = \frac{n-1}{3}$ faults (which is the best possible), guarantees strong safety for honest leaders, and requires no trusted hardware. Moreover, VBFT supports leader rotation and low-cost view change, thereby improving prior art on multiple axes. |

This paper focuses on protecting the lowest level layer in the blockchain, particularly the P2P network that allows the nodes to communicate and share information. The P2P network layer may be vulnerable to several families of attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), eclipse attacks, or Sybil attacks. This layer is prone to threats inherited from traditional P2P networks, and it must be analyzed and understood by collecting data and extracting insights from the network behavior to reduce those risks. We introduce Tikuna, an open-source tool for monitoring and detecting potential attacks on the Ethereum blockchain P2P network, at an early stage. Tikuna employs an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect attacks and alert users. Empirical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves detection performance, with the ability to detect and classify attacks, including eclipse attacks, Covert Flash attacks, and others that target the Ethereum blockchain P2P network layer, with high accuracy. Our research findings demonstrate that Tikuna is a valuable security tool for assisting operators to efficiently monitor and safeguard the status of Ethereum validators and the wider P2P network |

Wen et.al.|[2310.09143](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09143)| In the era of digital markets, the challenge for consumers is discerning quality amidst information asymmetry. While traditional markets use brand mechanisms to address this issue, transferring such systems to internet-based P2P markets, where misleading practices like fake ratings are rampant, remains challenging. Current internet platforms strive to counter this through verification algorithms, but these efforts find themselves in a continuous tug-of-war with counterfeit actions.   Exploiting the transparency, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology, this paper introduces a robust reputation voting system grounded in it. Unlike existing blockchain-based reputation systems, our model harnesses an intrinsically economically incentivized approach to bolster agent integrity. We optimize this model to mirror real-world user behavior, preserving the reputation system's foundational sustainability. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, using both uniform and power-law distributions enabled by an innovative inverse transform method, we traverse a broad parameter landscape, replicating real-world complexity. The findings underscore the promise of a sustainable, transparent, and formidable reputation mechanism. Given its structure, our framework can potentially function as a universal, sustainable oracle for offchain-onchain bridging, aiding entities in perpetually cultivating their reputation. Future integration with technologies like Ring Signature and Zero Knowledge Proof could amplify the system's privacy facets, rendering it particularly influential in the ever-evolving digital domain. |

The idea is to recognize the authenticity of a copy or digital document issued by an institution in a foreign country and detect forgeries. Certificates, financial records, health records, official papers and others are often required to be attested from multiple entities in distinct locations. However, in this digital era where most applications happen online, and document copies are uploaded, the traditional signature and seal methods are obsolete. In a matter of minutes and with a simple photo editor, a certificate or document copy may be plagiarized or forged. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized approach to record and verify transactions without the need for huge infrastructure investment. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based nostrification system, where awarding institutions generate a digital certificate, store in a public but permissioned blockchain, where students and other stakeholders may verify. We present a thorough discussion and formal evaluation of the proposed system. |

For efficient P2P trading, a free market for trading needs to be established while ensuring the information reliability, security, and privacy. Blockchain has been used to provide this framework, but it consumes very high energy and is slow. Further, until now, no blockchain model has considered the role of conventional electric utility companies in P2P trading. In this paper, we have introduced a credit blockchain that reduces energy consumption by employing a new mechanism to update transactions and increases speed by providing interest free loans to buyers. This model also integrates the electric utility companies within the P2P trading framework, thereby increasing members trading options. We have also discussed the pricing strategies for trading. All the above assertions have been verified through simulations, demonstrating that this model will promote P2P trading by providing enhanced security, speed, and greater trading options. The proposed model will also help trade energy at prices beneficial for both sellers and buyers. |
|**2023-10-13**|**Liveness Checking of the HotStuff Protocol Family**|Jérémie Decouchant et.al.|[2310.09006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09006)| Byzantine consensus protocols aim at maintaining safety guarantees under any network synchrony model and at providing liveness in partially or fully synchronous networks. However, several Byzantine consensus protocols have been shown to violate liveness properties under certain scenarios. Existing testing methods for checking the liveness of consensus protocols check for time-bounded liveness violations, which generate a large number of false positives. In this work, for the first time, we check the liveness of Byzantine consensus protocols using the temperature and lasso detection methods, which require the definition of ad-hoc system state abstractions. We focus on the HotStuff protocol family that has been recently developed for blockchain consensus. In this family, the HotStuff protocol is both safe and live under the partial synchrony assumption, while the 2-Phase Hotstuff and Sync HotStuff protocols are known to violate liveness in subtle fault scenarios. We implemented our liveness checking methods on top of the Twins automated unit test generator to test the HotStuff protocol family. Our results indicate that our methods successfully detect all known liveness violations and produce fewer false positives than the traditional time-bounded liveness checks. |

This has been a long-overlooked gap, as existing studies have primarily focused on inter-committee (validator set) behaviors and activities, while neglecting the dynamic formation of committees, especially for individual stakeholders seeking reliable validators. Our study bridges this gap by diving into the delegation process (normal users delegate their small-value tokens to delegatees who later act as validators) before entering an actual consensus phase.   We propose a Bayesian model to quantify normal users' trust in delegatees, which we further incorporate into a game-theoretical model to simulate users' reactions against a set of critical factors identified through extensive research (including 10+ staking service provider as well as 30+ PoS blockchains). Our results reveal that users tend to choose their delegatees and utilize their tokens by carefully weighing the delegation cost, the behaviors of other users, and the reputation of delegatees, ultimately reaching a Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, the collective trend significantly increases the likelihood of token concentration on a small number of delegatees. |

This paper introduces HybridChain that combines the advantages of sharded blockchain and DAG distributed ledger, and a consensus algorithm that leverages decentralized learning. Our approach involves validators exchanging perceptions as votes to assess potential conflicts between transactions and the witness set, representing input transactions in the UTXO model. These perceptions collectively contribute to an intermediate belief regarding the validity of transactions. By integrating their beliefs with those of other validators, localized decisions are made to determine validity. Ultimately, a final consensus is achieved through a majority vote, ensuring precise and efficient validation of transactions. Our proposed approach is compared to the existing DAG-based scheme IOTA and the sharded blockchain Omniledger through extensive simulations. The results show that IOTA has high throughput and low latency but sacrifices accuracy and is vulnerable to orphanage attacks especially with low transaction rates. Omniledger achieves stable accuracy by increasing shards but has increased latency. In contrast, the proposed HybridChain exhibits fast, accurate, and secure transaction processing, and excellent scalability. |

In contrast to existing works for coded blockchains, especially blockchain-of-things, the proposed scheme is more realistic, practical, and secure while achieving high throughput. This is accomplished by: 1) modeling the variety of transactions using a reward model, based on which an optimization problem is solved to select transactions that are more accessible and cheaper computational-wise to be processed together; 2) a transaction-based and lightweight consensus algorithm that emphasizes on using the minimum possible number of miners for processing the transactions; and 3) employing the raptor codes with linear-time encoding and decoding which results in requiring lower storage to maintain the blockchain and having a higher throughput. We provide detailed analysis and simulation results on the proposed scheme and compare it with the state-of-the-art coded IoT blockchain schemes including Polyshard and LCB, to show the advantages of our proposed scheme in terms of security, storage, decentralization, and throughput. |
|**2024-03-25**|**The Implications of Decentralization in Blockchained Federated Learning: Evaluating the Impact of Model Staleness and Inconsistencies**|Francesc Wilhelmi et.al.|[2310.07471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07471)| Blockchain promises to enhance distributed machine learning (ML) approaches such as federated learning (FL) by providing further decentralization, security, immutability, and trust, which are key properties for enabling collaborative intelligence in next-generation applications. Nonetheless, the intrinsic decentralized operation of peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes leads to an uncharted setting for FL, whereby the concepts of FL round and global model become meaningless, as devices' synchronization is lost without the figure of a central orchestrating server. In this paper, we study the practical implications of outsourcing the orchestration of FL to a democratic setting such as in a blockchain. In particular, we focus on the effects that model staleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on the training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we evaluate the blockchained FL operation by applying two different ML models (ranging from low to high complexity) on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and focus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions. Our results show the high impact of model inconsistencies on the accuracy of the models (up to a ~35% decrease in prediction accuracy), which underscores the importance of properly designing blockchain systems based on the characteristics of the underlying FL application. |
|**2023-10-11**|**A Microgrid Trading Framework Based on PoC Consensus**|Lianghaojie Zhou et.al.|[2310.07165](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07165)| In the field of energy Internet, blockchain-based distributed energy trading mode is a promising way to replace the traditional centralized trading mode. However, the current power blockchain platform based on public chain has problems such as low consensus efficiency and waste of computing resources. The energy trading platform based on the consortium chain has problems such as inability to attract users to join and collusion between alliances. We propose a microgrid trading framework based on proof of contribution (PoC). According to the contribution value, we randomly select nodes based on weights through verifiable random functions (VRF) in each round of consensus to form the next round of consensus committee. The proposed electricity trading framework not only improves the consensus efficiency of the blockchain, but also is suitable as an incentive mechanism to attract users to participate in the power blockchain. Experiments show that our framework is effective and the contribution value we designed is reasonable. Through our framework, we can motivate users to participate and make energy transactions more fair. |
|**2023-10-11**|**Decentralization of Energy Systems with Blockchain: Bridging Top-down and Bottom-up Management of the Electricity Grid**|Sakshi Mishra et.al.|[2310.07103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07103)| For more than a century, the grid has operated in a centralized top-down fashion. However, as distributed energy resources (DERs) penetration grows, the grid edge is increasingly infused with intelligent computing and communication capabilities. Thus, the bottom-up approach to grid operations inclined toward decentralizing energy systems will likely gain momentum alongside the existing centralized paradigm. Decentralization refers to transferring control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. It is not a new concept - in energy systems context or otherwise. In the energy systems context, however, the complexity of this multifaceted concept increases manifolds due to two major reasons - i) the nature of the commodity being traded (the electricity) and ii) the enormity of the traditional electricity sector's structure that builds, operates, and maintains this capital-intensive network. In this work, we aim to highlight the need for and outline a credible path toward restructuring the current operational architecture of the electricity grid in view of the ongoing decentralization trends with an emphasis on peer-to-peer energy trading. We further introduce blockchain technology in the context of decentralized energy systems problems. We also suggest that blockchain is an effective technology for facilitating the synergistic operations of top-down and bottom-up approaches to grid management. |
|**2024-03-11**|**Secure Decentralized Learning with Blockchain**|Xiaoxue Zhang et.al.|[2310.07079](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07079)| Federated Learning (FL) is a well-known paradigm of distributed machine learning on mobile and IoT devices, which preserves data privacy and optimizes communication efficiency. To avoid the single point of failure problem in FL, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed to use peer-to-peer communication for model aggregation, which has been considered an attractive solution for machine learning tasks on distributed personal devices. However, this process is vulnerable to attackers who share false models and data. If there exists a group of malicious clients, they might harm the performance of the model by carrying out a poisoning attack. In addition, in DFL, clients often lack the incentives to contribute their computing powers to do model training. In this paper, we proposed Blockchain-based Decentralized Federated Learning (BDFL), which leverages a blockchain for decentralized model verification and auditing. BDFL includes an auditor committee for model verification, an incentive mechanism to encourage the participation of clients, a reputation model to evaluate the trustworthiness of clients, and a protocol suite for dynamic network updates. Evaluation results show that, with the reputation mechanism, BDFL achieves fast model convergence and high accuracy on real datasets even if there exist 30\% malicious clients in the system. |

It is well known that no blockchain protocol can provide both to sleepy (intermittently online) clients under adversarial majority. However, safety is more critical in that a single safety violation can cause users to lose money. At the same time, liveness must not be lost forever. We show that, in a synchronous network, it is possible to maintain safety for all clients even during adversarial majority, and recover liveness after honest majority is restored. Our solution takes the form of a recovery gadget that can be applied to any protocol with certificates (such as HotStuff, Streamlet, Tendermint, and their variants). |
|**2024-05-24**|**BBCA-CHAIN: Low Latency, High Throughput BFT Consensus on a DAG**|Dahlia Malkhi et.al.|[2310.06335](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06335)| This paper presents a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol powered by BBCA, a lightly modified Byzantine Consistent Broadcast (BCB) primitive. BBCA provides a Complete-Adopt semantic through an added probing interface to allow either aborting the broadcast by correct nodes or exclusively, adopting the message consistently in case of a potential delivery. It does not introduce any extra types of messages or additional communication costs to BCB.   BBCA is harnessed into BBCA-CHAIN to make direct commits on a chained backbone of a causally ordered graph of blocks, without any additional voting blocks or artificial layering. With the help of Complete-Adopt, the additional knowledge gained from the underlying BCB completely removes the voting latency in popular DAG-based protocols. At the same time, causal ordering allows nodes to propose blocks in parallel and achieve high throughput. BBCA-CHAIN thus closes up the gap between protocols built by consistent broadcasts (e.g., Bullshark) to those without such an abstraction (e.g., PBFT/HotStuff), emphasizing their shared fundamental principles.   Using a Bracha-style BCB as an example, we fully specify BBCA-CHAIN with simplicity, serving as a solid basis for high-performance replication systems (and blockchains). |

Among them, the AI language model represented by ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve people in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in consulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee the authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are also hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover, the content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is difficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security issues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and affect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain technology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI. This paper mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain for LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process, and identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this paper also reviews the potential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier communication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic spectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined and the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early realization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community. |
|**2023-09-28**|**The Mediating Effect of Blockchain Technology on the Cryptocurrency Purchase Intention**|İbrahim Halil Efendioğlu et.al.|[2310.05970](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05970)| Cryptocurrencies, enabling secure digital asset transfers without a central authority, are experiencing increasing interest. With the increasing number of global and Turkish investors, it is evident that interest in digital assets will continue to rise sustainably, even in the face of financial fluctuations. However, it remains uncertain whether consumers perceive blockchain technology's ease of use and usefulness when purchasing cryptocurrencies. This study aims to explain blockchain technology's perceived ease of use and usefulness in cryptocurrency purchases by considering factors such as quality customer service, reduced costs, efficiency, and reliability. To achieve this goal, data were obtained from 463 participants interested in cryptocurrencies in different regions of Turkey. The data were analyzed using SPSS Process Macro programs. The analysis results indicate that perceived ease of use and usefulness mediate the effects of customer service and reduced costs, efficiency, and security on purchase intention. |

Once data owners share their data with others, though, it is no longer possible for them to control how their data are used. To address this issue, we propose a usage control architecture to monitor compliance with usage control policies. To this end, our solution relies on blockchain and trusted execution environments. We demonstrate the potential of the architecture by describing the various workflows needed to realize a motivating use case scenario for data markets. Additionally, we discuss the merits of the approach from privacy, security, integrateability, and affordability perspectives. |
|**2023-10-15**|**Federated Learning: A Cutting-Edge Survey of the Latest Advancements and Applications**|Azim Akhtarshenas et.al.|[2310.05269](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05269)| In the realm of machine learning (ML) systems featuring client-host connections, the enhancement of privacy security can be effectively achieved through federated learning (FL) as a secure distributed ML methodology. FL effectively integrates cloud infrastructure to transfer ML models onto edge servers using blockchain technology. Through this mechanism, it guarantees the streamlined processing and data storage requirements of both centralized and decentralized systems, with an emphasis on scalability, privacy considerations, and cost-effective communication. In current FL implementations, data owners locally train their models, and subsequently upload the outcomes in the form of weights, gradients, and parameters to the cloud for overall model aggregation. This innovation obviates the necessity of engaging Internet of Things (IoT) clients and participants to communicate raw and potentially confidential data directly with a cloud center. This not only reduces the costs associated with communication networks but also enhances the protection of private data. This survey conducts an analysis and comparison of recent FL applications, aiming to assess their efficiency, accuracy, and privacy protection. However, in light of the complex and evolving nature of FL, it becomes evident that additional research is imperative to address lingering knowledge gaps and effectively confront the forthcoming challenges in this field. In this study, we categorize recent literature into the following clusters: privacy protection, resource allocation, case study analysis, and applications. Furthermore, at the end of each section, we tabulate the open areas and future directions presented in the referenced literature, affording researchers and scholars an insightful view of the evolution of the field. |

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided disaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief networks by swiftly assessing affected areas and timely delivering lifesaving supplies. To meet the growing demands for collaborative, trust-free, and transparent UDRN services, blockchain-based UDRNs emerge as a promising approach through immutable ledgers and distributed smart contracts. However, several efficiency and security challenges hinder the deployment of blockchain-based UDRNs, including the lack of cooperation between smart contracts, lack of dynamic audit for smart contract vulnerabilities, and low forensics robustness against transaction malleability attacks. Towards efficient and secure blockchain-based UDRNs, this paper presents potential solutions: (i) a series of collaborative smart contracts for coordinated relief management, (ii) a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown contract vulnerabilities; and (iii) a robust transaction forensics strategy with on/off-chain cooperation to resist transaction malleability attacks. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we outline key open research issues crucial to advancing this emerging field. |
|**2023-10-08**|**Optimizing Large Language Models to Expedite the Development of Smart Contracts**|Nii Osae Osae Dade et.al.|[2310.05178](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05178)| Programming has always been at the heart of technological innovation in the 21st century. With the advent of blockchain technologies and the proliferation of web3 paradigms of decentralised applications, smart contracts have been very instrumental in enabling developers to build applications that reside on decentralised blockchains. Despite the huge interest and potential of smart contracts, there is still a significant knowledge and skill gap that developers need to cross in order to build web3 applications. In light of this, we introduce MazzumaGPT, a large language model that has been optimised to generate smart contract code and aid developers to scaffold development and improve productivity. As part of this research, we outline the optimisation and fine-tuning parameters, evaluate the model's performance on functional correctness and address the limitations and broader impacts of our research. |

How to analyse the utility of opinion leaders' influence in realizing assets on the blockchain and adopt a compliant regulatory scheme is worth exploring and pondering. Taking Musk's call on social media to buy Dogecoin as an example, this paper uses an event study to empirically investigate the phenomenon in which opinion leaders use ICOs (initial coin offerings) to exert influence. The results show that opinion leaders can use ICOs to influence the price of token assets with money and data traffic in their social network. They can obtain excess returns and reduce the cost of realization so that the closed loop of influence realization will be accelerated. Based on this phenomenon and the results of its impact, we use the ChainLink Oracle with Active Sensor Networks(CO-ASnet) to design a safe and applicable decentralized regulatory scheme that can constructively provide risk assessment strategies and early warning measures for token issuance. The influence realization of opinion leaders in blockchain issuance is bound to receive widespread attention, and this paper will provide an exemplary reference for regulators and enterprises to explore the boundaries of blockchain financial product development and governance. |

This paper considers the deployment of Metaverse service in a cloud-edge resource architecture, which can satisfy the escalating demand for Metaverse service resources while ensuring both high bandwidth and low latency. We propose a novel mechanism, named Reliable and Secure Metaverse Service (RSMS), to ensure Metaverse service reliability and security without sacrificing performance. RSMS consists of two protocols: (1) One is a blockchain-based lightweight mutual authentication protocol concerning heterogeneous Metaverse service resource nodes (RNs) dynamically joining a Metaverse service resource pool while guaranteeing their trustworthiness, which guarantees the security of Metaverse service. (2) The other is a group authentication protocol used to form and maintain a stable and secure Metaverse service group composed by RNs, which ensures the reliability and enhances the security of Metaverse service. The reliability and security of Metaverse service under RSMS are thoroughly discussed, and informal and formal security analysis are conducted. Additionally, we study the impact of RSMS on Metaverse service throughput, demonstrating its lightweight feature. |

As the industrial IoT landscape expands, the establishment of secure and reliable infrastructure becomes crucial to instil trust among users and stakeholders, particularly in addressing fundamental concerns such as traceability, integrity protection, and privacy that some industries still encounter today. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving method in the industry's IoT systems using blockchain-based data access control for remote industry safety monitoring and maintaining event information confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. |
|**2023-10-08**|**A Trustworthy and Consistent Blockchain Oracle Scheme for Industrial Internet of Things**|Peng Liu et.al.|[2310.04975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04975)| Blockchain provides decentralization and trustlessness features for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which expands the application scenarios of IIoT. To address the problem that the blockchain cannot actively obtain off-chain data, the blockchain oracle is proposed as a bridge between the blockchain and external data. However, the existing oracle schemes are difficult to solve the problem of low quality of service caused by frequent data changes and heterogeneous devices in IIoT, and the current oracle node selection schemes are difficult to balance security and quality of service. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a secure and reliable oracle scheme that can obtain high-quality off-chain data. Specifically, we first design an oracle node selection algorithm based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation mechanism to securely select high-quality nodes. Second, we propose a data filtering algorithm based on a sliding window to further improve the consistency of the collected data. We verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the service quality of the oracle. |

Starting with an identification of the core functionalities and techniques employed by mixing services, the paper delves into detailed explanations of these operational mechanisms. It further outlines an evaluation framework tailored for a rigorous assessment, highlighting the key vulnerabilities and strengths of various solutions. In addition, the study identifies potential attack vectors that compromise these services. The paper explores the dual nature of mixing services, while they contribute to the preservation of privacy, a cornerstone of blockchain technologies, they can also facilitate illicit activities. By addressing key research questions, this study not only offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of mixing services but also sets the stage for future academic discourse in this evolving field. |

However, they currently rely on a centralized sequencer to determine transaction ordering, compromising the decentralization principle of blockchain systems. Recognizing this, there is a clear need for decentralized sequencers in rollups. However, designing such a system is intricate. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of decentralized sequencers in rollups, formulating their ideal properties, dissecting their core components, and synthesizing community insights. Our findings emphasize the imperative for an adept sequencer design, harmonizing with the overarching goals of the blockchain ecosystem, and setting a trajectory for subsequent research endeavors. |
|**2023-10-06**|**Dissecting Smart Contract Languages: A Survey**|Majd Soud et.al.|[2310.02799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02799)| Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that gained popularity for enabling the transformation of cryptocurrency among peers without mediation by a centralized third-party authority. Smart contracts expand the applications of blockchain technology and have played a role in its widespread adoption. Smart contracts are immutable digital programs that are deployed on blockchains to codify agreements between parties. Existing smart contract implementations have faced challenges, including security vulnerabilities, leading to significant losses and concerns. This has stimulated a wave of attempts to improve Smart Contract Languages (SCLs) to overcome implementation challenges and ensure code quality, producing many languages with diverse features. Scholars have made some attempts to classify SCLs and clarify the process of selecting an SCL, but to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive survey of existing SCLs has been published. Our work surpasses earlier efforts by evaluating a significantly larger set of SCLs, in greater depth, to ease the process of SCL selection for blockchain research and implementation. In this paper, we (1) propose a robust framework for comparing existing SCLs, (2) analyze and discuss 36 SCLs, addressing issues beyond those used to construct the comparison framework, and (3) define new parameters for future research and development of SCLs. The survey provides a guide for those who intend to select or use an SCL to implement smart contracts, develop new SCLs, or add new extensions to the existing SCLs. |
|**2024-05-10**|**zkFL: Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Gradient Aggregation for Federated Learning**|Zhipeng Wang et.al.|[2310.02554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02554)| Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed. |

Unlike existing tools, our toolchain combines the power of ANTLR4 and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) traversal techniques to transform the architecture and interactions within smart contracts into a specialized bipartite graph. This enables advanced network analytics to highlight operational efficiencies within the DApp's architecture.   The bipartite graph generated by the proposed tool comprises two sets of nodes: one representing smart contracts, interfaces, and libraries, and the other including functions, events, and modifiers. Edges in the graph connect functions to smart contracts they interact with, offering a granular view of interdependencies and execution flow within the DApp. This network-centric approach allows researchers and practitioners to apply complex network theory in understanding the robustness, adaptability, and intricacies of decentralized systems.   Our work contributes to the enhancement of security in smart contracts by allowing the visualisation of the network, and it provides a deep understanding of the architecture and operational logic within DApps. Given the growing importance of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem and the emerging application of complex network theory in technology, our toolchain offers a timely contribution to both academic research and practical applications in the field of blockchain technology. |

NFTs serve as the foundational framework that has revolutionized the market for digital art, enabling artists to showcase and monetize their creations in unprecedented ways. NFTs combine metadata stored on the blockchain with off-chain data, such as images, to create a novel form of digital ownership. It is not fully understood how these factors come together to determine NFT prices. In this study, we analyze both on-chain and off-chain data of NFT collections trading on OpenSea to understand what influences NFT pricing. Our results show that while text and image data of the NFTs can be used to explain price variations within collections, the extracted features do not generalize to new, unseen collections. Furthermore, we find that an NFT collection's trading volume often relates to its online presence, like social media followers and website traffic. |
|**2024-05-22**|**Data Transmissions in Blockchain enabled AGVs**|Junhan Liu et.al.|[2310.01594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01594)| Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) operate in synergy to execute specific tasks. These vehicles exchange information to ensure seamless collaboration, prevent collisions, and eliminate task redundancy. The advent of blockchain technology offers a promising avenue for establishing a secure and dependable communication infrastructure for AGVs. Nonetheless, it becomes imperative for AGVs to adopt efficient data transmission methodologies, especially when interacting with the dynamic nature of blockchain infrastructure where data undergoes frequent modifications.   In the present study, we introduce a novel data transmission methodology tailored for blockchain-integrated AGVs utilizing the principles of Named Data Networking (NDN). A simulated environment was crafted and executed in NetSim, wherein multiple AGVs collaboratively endeavored to locate concealed objectives within a defined region. Upon discovery of novel elements, such as obstructions or concealed objectives, each AGV would update a collective blockchain repository. This blockchain infrastructure leverages NDN to fetch specific data blocks in response to data queries from individual AGVs. This system ensures that AGVs can navigate and scrutinize their environment with heightened efficiency, drawing upon the collective intelligence and shared experiences of the fleet. |

Newman et.al.|[2310.01546](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01546)| Corruptive majority attacks, in which mining power is distributed among miners and an attacker attempts to bribe a majority of miners into participation in a majority attack, pose a threat to blockchains. Budish bounded the cost of bribing miners to participate in an attack by their expected loss as a result of attack success. We show that this bound is loose. In particular, an attack may be structured so that under equilibrium play by most miners, a miner's choice to participate only slightly affects the attack success chance. Combined with the fact that most of the cost of attack success is externalized by any given small miner, this implies that if most mining power is controlled by small miners, bribing miners to participate in such an attack is much cheaper than the Budish bound. We provide a scheme for a cheap corruptive majority attack and discuss practical concerns and consequences. |

While many countries have adopted a national digital identity system, many are still in the process of establishing one. Through a comparative analysis of the technological and legal dimensions of a few selected national digital identity solutions currently being used in different countries, we highlight the diversity of technologies and architectures and the key role of the legal framework of a given digital identity solution. We also present several key issues related to the implementation of these solutions, how to ensure the State sovereignty over them, and how to strike the right balance between private sector and public sector needs. This position paper aims to help policy makers, software developers and concerned users understand the challenges of designing, implementing and using a national digital identity management system and establishing a legal framework for digital identity management, including personal data protection measures. The authors of this paper have a favorable position for self-sovereign identity management systems that are based on Blockchain technology, and we believe they are the most suitable for national digital identity systems. |

The ability of IoT appliances to provide pervasive and better support to everyday tasks, in most cases transparently to humans, is also achieved through the high degree of autonomy of such devices. However, the higher the number of new capabilities and services provided in an autonomous way, the wider the attack surface that exposes users to data hacking and lost. In this scenario, many critical challenges arise also because IoT devices have heterogeneous computational capabilities (i.e., in the same network there might be simple sensors/actuators as well as more complex and smart nodes). In this paper, we try to provide a contribution in this setting, tackling the non-trivial issues of equipping smart things with a strategy to evaluate, also through their neighbors, the trustworthiness of an object in the network before interacting with it. To do so, we design a novel and fully distributed trust model exploiting devices' behavioral fingerprints, a distributed consensus mechanism and the Blockchain technology. Beyond the detailed description of our framework, we also illustrate the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance. |
|**2023-10-02**|**A Decentralized Cooperative Navigation Approach for Visual Homing Networks**|Mohamed Rahouti et.al.|[2310.00906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00906)| Visual homing is a lightweight approach to visual navigation. Given the stored information of an initial 'home' location, the navigation task back to this location is achieved from any other location by comparing the stored home information to the current image and extracting a motion vector. A challenge that constrains the applicability of visual homing is that the home location must be within the robot's field of view to initiate the homing process. Thus, we propose a blockchain approach to visual navigation for a heterogeneous robot team over a wide area of visual navigation. Because it does not require map data structures, the approach is useful for robot platforms with a small computational footprint, and because it leverages current visual information, it supports a resilient and adaptive path selection. Further, we present a lightweight Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism for reaching consensus in the untrustworthy visual homing network. |

On the Ethereum platform, Ponzi schemes, phishing scams, and a variety of other frauds emerge. Existing Ponzi scheme detection approaches based on heterogeneous transaction graph modeling leverages semantic information between node (account) pairs to establish connections, overlooking the semantic attributes inherent to the edges (interactions). To overcome this, we construct heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs with multiple triplet interaction patterns to better depict the real Ethereum environment. Based on this, we design a new framework named multi-triplet augmented heterogeneous graph neural network (MAHGNN) for Ponzi scheme detection. We introduce the Conditional Variational Auto Encoder (CVAE) to capture the semantic information of different triplet interaction patterns, which facilitates the characterization on account features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAHGNN is capable of addressing the problem of multi-edge interactions in heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs and achieving state-of-the-art performance in Ponzi scheme detection. |
|**2023-09-30**|**A Distributed Efficient Blockchain Oracle Scheme for Internet of Things**|Youquan Xian et.al.|[2310.00254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00254)| In recent years, blockchain has been widely applied in the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain oracle, as a bridge for data communication between blockchain and off-chain, has also received significant attention. However, the numerous and heterogeneous devices in the IoT pose great challenges to the efficiency and security of data acquisition for oracles. We find that the matching relationship between data sources and oracle nodes greatly affects the efficiency and service quality of the entire oracle system. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed and efficient oracle solution tailored for the IoT, enabling fast acquisition of real-time off-chain data. Specifically, we first design a distributed oracle architecture that combines both Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) devices and ordinary devices to improve system scalability, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Secondly, based on the trusted node information provided by TEE, we determine the matching relationship between nodes and data sources, assigning appropriate nodes for tasks to enhance system efficiency. Through simulation experiments, our proposed solution has been shown to effectively improve the efficiency and service quality of the system, reducing the average response time by approximately 9.92\% compared to conventional approaches. |
|**2023-09-29**|**Probabilistic Sampling-Enhanced Temporal-Spatial GCN: A Scalable Framework for Transaction Anomaly Detection in Ethereum Networks**|Stefan Kambiz Behfar et.al.|[2310.00144](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00144)| The rapid evolution of the Ethereum network necessitates sophisticated techniques to ensure its robustness against potential threats and to maintain transparency. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have pioneered anomaly detection in such platforms, capturing the intricacies of both spatial and temporal transactional patterns has remained a challenge. This study presents a fusion of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Temporal Random Walks (TRW) enhanced by probabilistic sampling to bridge this gap. Our approach, unlike traditional GCNs, leverages the strengths of TRW to discern complex temporal sequences in Ethereum transactions, thereby providing a more nuanced transaction anomaly detection mechanism. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that our TRW-GCN framework substantially advances the performance metrics over conventional GCNs in detecting anomalies and transaction bursts. This research not only underscores the potential of temporal cues in Ethereum transactional data but also offers a scalable and effective methodology for ensuring the security and transparency of decentralized platforms. By harnessing both spatial relationships and time-based transactional sequences as node features, our model introduces an additional layer of granularity, making the detection process more robust and less prone to false positives. This work lays the foundation for future research aimed at optimizing and enhancing the transparency of blockchain technologies, and serves as a testament to the significance of considering both time and space dimensions in the ever-evolving landscape of the decentralized platforms. |

It emphasizes the inherent vulnerabilities embedded in the programming languages commonly employed for smart contract development, particularly within Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains. While the concrete example used primarily employs the Solidity programming language, the insights garnered from this study are readily generalizable to a wide array of blockchain architectures. Significantly, this article extends beyond the mere identification of vulnerabilities and ventures into the realm of proactive security measures. It explores the adaptation and adoption of dataflow programming paradigms, employing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to enforce security by design in the context of smart contract development. This forward-looking approach aims to bolster the foundational principles of blockchain security, offering a promising research direction for mitigating the risks associated with smart contract vulnerabilities. The objective of this article is to cater to a diverse audience, ranging from individuals with limited computer science and programming expertise to seasoned experts in the field. It provides a comprehensive and accessible resource for fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics between blockchain technology and the imperative need for secure smart contract development practices. |

Ballandies et.al.|[2309.16707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16707)| As digitalization and technological advancements continue to shape the infrastructure landscape, the emergence of blockchain-based decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) has gained prominence. However, a systematic categorization of DePIN components and their interrelationships is still missing. To address this gap, we conduct a literature review and analysis of existing frameworks and derived a taxonomy of DePIN systems from a conceptual architecture. Our taxonomy encompasses three key dimensions: distributed ledger technology, cryptoeconomic design and physicial infrastructure network. Within each dimension, we identify and define relevant components and attributes, establishing a clear hierarchical structure. Moreover, we illustrate the relationships and dependencies among the identified components, highlighting the interplay between governance models, hardware architectures, networking protocols, token mechanisms, and distributed ledger technologies. This taxonomy provides a foundation for understanding and classifying diverse DePIN networks, serving as a basis for future research and facilitating knowledge exchange, fostering collaboration and standardization within the emerging field of decentralized physical infrastructure networks. |

Missing these dimensions in healthcare information systems is a point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably perpetuate existing biases, produce far from optimal results, and may generate diagnosis errors. An often-overlooked community with distinct care values and needs are LGBT+ older adults, which has traditionally been under-surveyed in healthcare and technology design. This paper investigates the implications of missing gender and sex considerations in distributed ledger technologies for LGBT+ older adults. By using the value sensitive design methodology, our contribution shows that many value meanings dear to marginalized communities are not considered in the design of the blockchain, such as LGBT+ older adults' interpretations of trust, privacy, and security. By highlighting the LGBT+ older population values, our contribution alerts us to the potential discriminatory implications of these technologies, which do not consider the gender and sex differences of marginalized, silent populations. Focusing on one community throughout - LGBT+ older adults - we emphasize the need for a holistic, value sensitive design approach for the development of ledger technologies for healthcare, including the values of everyone within the healthcare ecosystem. |

A key enabler for adoption of blockchain-based federated learning is how to select suitable participants to train models collaboratively. Selecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on blockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is helpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying multi-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in each block, making the query time-consuming. An efficient query method for multi-dimensional metadata in the blockchain for selecting participants in FL is absent and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data structure to improve the query efficiency within each block named MerkleRB-Tree. In detail, we leverage Minimal Bounding Rectangle(MBR) and bloom-filters for the query process of multi-dimensional continuous-valued attributes and discrete-valued attributes respectively. Furthermore, we migrate the idea of the skip list along with an MBR and a bloom filter at the head of each block to enhance the query efficiency for inter-blocks. The performance analysis and extensive evaluation results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method in blockchain-based FL. |

If the attacker's chain has the most cumulative mining puzzle difficulty, nodes will recognize it as canonical. We propose a modification to PoW protocols, called ADESS, that contains two novel features. The first modification enables a node to identify the attacker chain by comparing the temporal sequence of blocks on competing chains. The second modification penalizes the attacker by requiring it to apply exponentially increasing hashrate in order to make its chain canonical. We demonstrate two things; (i) the expected cost of carrying out a double-spend attack is weakly higher under ADESS compared to the current PoW protocols and (ii) for any value of transaction, there is a penalty setting in ADESS that renders the expected profit of a double-spend attack negative. |

The framework provides economic incentives to participate through a mechanism that guarantee fixed prices across pairwise liquidity pools. |

This extraction stems from a lack of user privacy upon transaction submission and the ability of a monopolist validator to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. There are two main directions to reduce MEV: reduce the flexibility of the miner to reorder transactions by enforcing ordering rules and/or introduce a competitive market for the right to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. In this work, we unify these approaches via \emph{uncertainty principles}, akin to those found in harmonic analysis and physics. This provides a quantitative trade-off between the freedom to reorder transactions and the complexity of an economic payoff to a user in a decentralized network. This trade off is analogous to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and demonstrates that sequencing rules in blockchains need to be application specific. Our results suggest that neither so-called fair ordering techniques nor economic mechanisms can individually mitigate MEV for arbitrary payoff functions. |

Alkhodair et.al.|[2309.13498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13498)| The most essential component of every Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the Consensus Algorithm (CA), which enables users to reach a consensus in a decentralized and distributed manner. Numerous CA exist, but their viability for particular applications varies, making their trade-offs a crucial factor to consider when implementing DLT in a specific field. This article provided a comprehensive analysis of the various consensus algorithms used in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and blockchain networks. We cover an extensive array of thirty consensus algorithms. Eleven attributes including hardware requirements, pre-trust level, tolerance level, and more, were used to generate a series of comparison tables evaluating these consensus algorithms. In addition, we discuss DLT classifications, the categories of certain consensus algorithms, and provide examples of authentication-focused and data-storage-focused DLTs. In addition, we analyze the pros and cons of particular consensus algorithms, such as Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS), Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS), and Avalanche. In conclusion, we discuss the applicability of these consensus algorithms to various Cyber Physical System (CPS) use cases, including supply chain management, intelligent transportation systems, and smart healthcare. |

With its wide adoption, it operates as a highly critical public ledger. On its transition to become more scalable and sustainable, shifting to PoS without sacrificing the security and resilience of PoW, Ethereum offers a range of consensus clients to participate in the network. In this paper, we present a methodology to measure the performance of the consensus clients based on the latency to receive messages from the p2p network. The paper includes a study that identifies the incentives and limitations that the network experiences, presenting insights about the latency impact derived from running the software in different locations. |

Grassroots cryptocurrencies turn mutual trust into liquidity and thus could be a powerful means for 'banking the unbanked'. Grassroots cryptocurrencies have not been provided yet with a payment system, which is the goal of this paper. Here, we present Grassroots Flash, a payment system for grassroots cryptocurrencies that employs the blocklace -- a DAG-like counterpart of the blockchain data structure. We analyze its security (safety, liveness, and privacy) and efficiency, prove that it is indeed grassroots. |
|**2023-09-22**|**Optimal Dynamic Fees for Blockchain Resources**|Davide Crapis et.al.|[2309.12735](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12735)| We develop a general and practical framework to address the problem of the optimal design of dynamic fee mechanisms for multiple blockchain resources. Our framework allows to compute policies that optimally trade-off between adjusting resource prices to handle persistent demand shifts versus being robust to local noise in the observed block demand. In the general case with more than one resource, our optimal policies correctly handle cross-effects (complementarity and substitutability) in resource demands. We also show how these cross-effects can be used to inform resource design, i.e. combining resources into bundles that have low demand-side cross-effects can yield simpler and more efficient price-update rules. Our framework is also practical, we demonstrate how it can be used to refine or inform the design of heuristic fee update rules such as EIP-1559 or EIP-4844 with two case studies. We then estimate a uni-dimensional version of our model using real market data from the Ethereum blockchain and empirically compare the performance of our optimal policies to EIP-1559. |

The key insight of Cuttlefish is that consensus in blockchains is necessary due to contention, rather than multiple owners of an asset as suggested by prior work. Previous proposals proactively use consensus to prevent contention from blocking assets, taking a pessimistic approach. In contrast, Cuttlefish introduces collective objects and multi-owner transactions that can offer most of the functionality of classic blockchains when objects transacted on are not under contention. Additionally, in case of contention, Cuttlefish proposes a novel `Unlock' protocol that significantly reduces the latency of unblocking contented objects. By leveraging these features, Cuttlefish implements consensus-less protocols for a broader range of transactions, including asset swaps and multi-signature transactions, which were previously believed to require consensus. |
|**2023-09-22**|**HammerHead: Leader Reputation for Dynamic Scheduling**|Giorgos Tsimos et.al.|[2309.12713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12713)| The need for high throughput and censorship resistance in blockchain technology has led to research on DAG-based consensus. The Sui blockchain protocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower latency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when candidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by Carousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike Carousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in mind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly provided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might commit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our implementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless setting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase when suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults). |

However, the capacity of miners to strategically order transactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks, sandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for their own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes recently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of transactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price. Utilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct sandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.   However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free profits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal strategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility of miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results unveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally strategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of trading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter represents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.   Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon: Miner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without trading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm, all users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent or surpass profits compared to their expectations. This outcome provides further support for the study and design of sequencing rules in decentralized exchanges. |

This study investigates the trade-offs between GPS utility and privacy among drivers, using a mixed-method approach that includes a survey of 151 participants and 10 follow-up interviews. We examine usage patterns, feature preferences, and comfort levels with location tracking and destination prediction. Our findings demonstrate that users tend to overlook potential privacy risks in favor of the utility the technology provides. We also find that users do not mind sharing inaccurate or obfuscated location data as long as their frequently visited locations aren't identified, and their full driving routes can't be recreated. Based on our findings, we explore design opportunities for enhancing privacy and utility, including adaptive interfaces, personalized profiles, and technological innovations like blockchain. |

Medical data security seems critical aspect due to sensitivity of patient information. Unauthorized access of medical data creates major issue to patients. This article proposed block chain with hybrid encryption technique for securing medical data stored in block chain model at cloud storage. New Two fish encryption model is implemented based on RSA Multiple Precision Arithmetic. MPA works by using library concept. The objective of using this methodology is to enhance security performance with less execution time. Patient data is processed by encryption algorithm and stored at blockchain infrastructure using encrypted key. Access permission allows user to read or write the medical data attached in block chain framework. The performance of traditional cryptographic techniques is very less in providing security infrastructure. |

|**2023-09-20**|**Lazy Contracts: Alleviating High Gas Costs by Secure and Trustless Off-chain Execution of Smart Contracts**|Soroush Farokhnia et.al.|[2309.11317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11317)| Smart contracts are programs that are executed on the blockchain and can hold, manage and transfer assets in the form of cryptocurrencies. The contract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus, i.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls and keep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such as Ethereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by malicious parties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavy computations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of a function call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps prevent DoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022, on Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3 Billion USD. This thesis proposes "lazy contracts" as a solution to alleviate these costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuring that each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, while preserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about the state of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chain execution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to the contract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can only happen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol can identify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for the entire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly. Finally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Solidity contracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January 2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by 55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees. |
|**2023-09-20**|**A Game-theoretic Approach for Provably-Uniform Random Number Generation in Decentralized Networks**|Zhuo Cai et.al.|[2309.11250](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11250)| Many protocols in distributed computing rely on a source of randomness, usually called a random beacon, both for their applicability and security. This is especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the next miner or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihood to be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.   Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroboros and Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely on pseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform, which is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate their randomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants are required to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of a final random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that the numbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentive for the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beacons have both limitations.   In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation of randomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar to some of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by different participants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial difference is that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone's best interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is the first to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, the approach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers. It is also tamper-proof and no party can change the output or affect its distribution. Finally, it is designed with modularity in mind and can be easily plugged into existing distributed protocols such as proof-of-stake blockchains. |

However, the responsible authorities may be incentivized to ignore certain reports, e.g., when addressing them inflicts high costs. In this work, we explore the applicability of blockchain technology to hold authorities accountable regarding filed reports. Our initial assessment indicates that our approach can be extended to benefit citizens and authorities in the future. |

The permissionless nature of the blockchains where these smart contracts are executed makes DeFi services exposed to security risks, since adversaries can target any of the underlying contracts to economically damage the compound service. We introduce a new notion of secure composability of smart contracts, which ensures that adversaries cannot economically harm the compound contract by interfering with its dependencies. |

Recent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies have been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such synthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable code generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable lines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when generating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we deny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To evaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC security. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397 Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning took more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned model could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were vulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing different types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that more than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further fine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of vulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning took only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and found that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as vulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could efficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code. |
|**2023-09-18**|**New Bounds on the Accuracy of Majority Voting for Multi-Class Classification**|Sina Aeeneh et.al.|[2309.09564](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09564)| Majority voting is a simple mathematical function that returns the value that appears most often in a set. As a popular decision fusion technique, the majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where a number of independent voters report their opinions on a classification problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble learning, data crowd-sourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multi-class classification problem has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive a new upper bound on the accuracy of the MVF for the multi-class classification problem. More specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF exponentially decays toward zero as the number of independent voters increases. Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of independent voters if these conditions are not met.   We first explore the problem for independent and identically distributed voters where we assume that every voter follows the same conditional probability distribution of voting for different classes, given the true classification of the data point. Next, we extend our results for the case where the voters are independent but non-identically distributed. Using the derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate only when the MVF achieves a small error rate, and vice versa, achieve a large error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. In the worst-case scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may achieve a higher error rate than the MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical simulations. |

Although many existing works on the overall system performance of Hyperledger Fabric are available, a decomposition of each phase in Hyperledger Fabric remains to be explored. Admittedly, the overall system performance of Hyperledger Fabric might provide an end-user with satisfied performance information when invoking a transaction; however, it is far from informative when deploying a distributed system with specific performance goals, except for understanding each phase in Hyperledger Fabric. In this paper, we develop a measurement framework to characterize each phase's transaction and block data in Hyperledger Fabric based on the Fabric SDK Nodejs, where we thoroughly analyze and open source the implementation details of the measurement framework. We evaluate the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and have some interesting observations; 1. The number of CPU cores has a linear impact on the throughput of an endorsing peer. 2. The Raft-based ordering service shows good scalability with the number of ordering service nodes. 3. The communication latencies between the client and service in Hyperledger Fabric are significant. We then identify each phase's dominant latency in Hyperledger Fabric via primitive operation analysis and propose a stochastic computation model for performance analysis. We also use the alpha-beta communication model to analyze the corresponding communication latency. Finally, we validate the accuracy of the performance model on both local and cloud clusters. The experiment results and the performance model help guide the deployment of the Hyperledger Fabric service. |

In this paper, a novel consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Prospect-Theory (PoPT) is designed from the view of game theory, where the game prospect value is considered as an important election criterion of the block-recorder. PoPT portrays the popularity of a node in the network as an attribute, which is constituted by the subjective sensibilities of nodes. Furthermore, the performances of the PoPT and the willingness of ordinary nodes to participate in the consensus are analyzed, exploring fairness, decentralization, credibility, and the motivating ability of the consensus mechanism. Finally, numerical simulations with optimization of the PoPT consensus mechanism are demonstrated in the scenario of a smart grid system to illustrate the effectiveness of the PoPT. |

Vulnerabilities within them can trigger a cascade of consequences, resulting in significant losses. Many current papers primarily focus on classifying smart contracts for malicious intent, often relying on limited contract characteristics, such as bytecode or opcode. This paper proposes a novel, two-layered framework: 1) classifying and 2) directly repairing malicious contracts. Slither's vulnerability report is combined with source code and passed through a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and Large Language Models (LLMs), classifying and repairing each suggested vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and prompt-engineered LLMs. The smart contract repair models, built from pre-trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and fine-tuned Llama-2-7B models, reduced the overall vulnerability count by 97.5% and 96.7% respectively. A manual inspection of repaired contracts shows that all retain functionality, indicating that the proposed method is appropriate for automatic batch classification and repair of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. |

The dynamics of ledger's development can be mathematically represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). One essential property of a properly functioning shared ledger is that all network members holding a copy of the ledger agree on a sequence of information added to the ledger, which is referred to as consensus and is known to be related to a structural property of DAG called one-endedness. In this paper, we consider a model of distributed ledger with sequential stochastic arrivals that mimic attachment rules from the IOTA cryptocurrency. We first prove that the number of leaves in the random DAG is bounded by a constant infinitely often through the identification of a suitable martingale, and then prove that a sequence of specific events happens infinitely often. Combining those results we establish that, as time goes to infinity, the IOTA DAG is almost surely one-ended. |

This is largely motivated by emerging blockchain governance systems, which include voters with different weights and a massive number of community generated proposals. In such scenarios, it is natural to expect that voters will have incomplete preferences, as they may only be able to evaluate or be confident about a very small proportion of the alternatives. As a result, the election outcome may be significantly affected, leading to suboptimal decisions. Our central inquiry revolves around whether delegation of ballots to proxies possessing greater expertise or a more comprehensive understanding of the voters' preferences can lead to outcomes with higher legitimacy and enhanced voters' satisfaction in elections where voters submit incomplete preferences. To explore its aspects, we introduce the following model: potential proxies advertise their ballots over multiple issues, and each voter either delegates to a seemingly attractive proxy or casts a ballot directly. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions that could lead to a socially better outcome by leveraging the participation of proxies. We accompany our theoretical findings with experiments on instances derived from real datasets. Overall, our results enhance the understanding of the power of delegation towards improving election outcomes. |

Despite their crucial role, the development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions, showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score is lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the remaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these tools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract vulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field needs to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions; and the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models, specifically ChatGPT, for the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities. |

However, dynamically available TOB protocols are synchronous protocols, and they lose their safety guarantees during periods of asynchrony. This is a major issue in practice.   In this paper, we propose a simple but effective mechanism for tolerating bounded periods of asynchrony in dynamically available TOB protocols that ensure safety deterministically. We propose to trade off assumptions limiting the online/offline churn rate in exchange for tolerating bounded asynchronous periods through the use of a configurable message-expiration period.   In practice, this allows picking a small synchrony bound $\delta$, and therefore obtain a fast protocol in the common case, knowing that the protocol tolerates occasional periods of duration at most $\pi>\delta$ during which the bound does not hold. We show how to apply this idea to a state-of-the-art protocol to make it tolerate bounded periods of asynchrony. |

Existing AFL approaches are commonly under the assumption of sellers' market in that the service clients as sellers are treated as scarce resources so that the aggregation servers as buyers need to compete the bids. Yet, as the technology progresses, an increasing number of qualified clients are now capable of performing federated learning tasks, leading to shift from sellers' market to a buyers' market. In this paper, we shift the angle by adapting the procurement auction framework, aiming to explain the pricing behavior under buyers' market. Our modeling starts with basic setting under complete information, then move further to the scenario where sellers' information are not fully observable. In order to select clients with high reliability and data quality, and to prevent from external attacks, we utilize a blockchain-based reputation mechanism. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. |

We achieve this goal by maximizing an entropy function subject to specific constraints. These constraints are based on some prior information, including the average numbers of transactions in the block and the transaction pool, respectively. Furthermore, we use some numerical experiments to analyze how the key factors in this approximate expression depend on the crucial parameters of the blockchain system. As a result, this approximate expression has important theoretical significance in promoting practical applications of blockchain technology. At the same time, not only do the method and results given in this paper provide a new line in the study of blockchain queueing systems, but they also provide the theoretical basis and technical support for how to apply the information theory to the investigation of blockchain queueing networks and stochastic models more broadly. |

However, the current oracle schemes face the dilemma of security and service quality in the process of node selection, and the implicit interest relationship in financial applications leads to a significant conflict of interest between the task publisher and the executor, which reduces the participation enthusiasm of both parties and system security. Therefore, this paper proposes an anonymous node selection scheme that anonymously selects nodes with high reputations to participate in tasks to ensure the security and service quality of nodes. Then, this paper also details the interest requirements and behavioral motives of all parties in the payment settlement and asset valuation scenarios. Under the assumption of rational participants, an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game is proposed. It can achieve equilibrium under the pursuit of the interests of task publishers and executors, thereby ensuring the interests of all types of users and improving the enthusiasm of participation. Finally, we verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the variance of obtaining price data by about 55\% while ensuring security, and meeting the interests of all parties. |

Originally designed to solve privacy issues, ZKPs have now evolved into an effective remedy for scalability concerns and are applied in Zcash (internet money like Bitcoin). To enable ZKPs, Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) offer a verifier for bi-linear equations. To accurately and efficiently represent R1CS, several language tools like Circom, Noir, and Snarky have been proposed to automate the compilation of advanced programs into R1CS. However, due to the flexible nature of R1CS representation, there can be significant differences in the compiled R1CS forms generated from circuit language programs with the same underlying semantics. To address this issue, this paper uses a data-flow-based R1CS paradigm algorithm, which produces a standardized format for different R1CS instances with identical semantics. By using the normalized R1CS format circuits, the complexity of circuits' verification can be reduced. In addition, this paper presents an R1CS normalization algorithm benchmark, and our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of our methods. |

Employing social networks and graphs, as powerful tools for modeling connections within groups or communities would provide valuable guidance for analyzing these properties. This study mainly focuses on creating and examining networks related to two major decentralized exchanges including Uniswap Version 2 (UniswapV2) and SushiSwap. We have discovered that the distribution of nodes' degrees follows a power law that makes them scale-free networks, in addition, the centrality of tokens in exchange graphs provides valuable insights into their price and significance in cryptocurrency markets. These measures of centrality can be used to detect anomalies in cryptocurrency markets and prices. Notably, these networks exhibit remarkably similar structures, hinting at exciting research opportunities for modeling such networks. |

However, the lack of relay rewards reduces the willingness of light nodes to relay transactions, especially in the energy-constrained complex wireless network. This paper proposes a novel dual auction mechanism to allocate transaction fees for relay and validation behaviors in the wireless blockchain network. The dual auction mechanism consists of two sub-auction stages: the relay sub-auction and the validation sub-auction. In the relay sub-auction, relay nodes choose transactions based rewards to forward. Besides, relay nodes adjust the relaying probability through a no-regret algorithm to improve efficiency. In the validation sub-auction, full nodes select transactions using Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism to construct the block. We prove that the designed dual auction mechanism is Incentive Compatibility (IC), Individual Rationality (IR), and Computational Efficiency (CE). We also derive the upper bound of the social welfare difference between the social optimal auction and our proposed one. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dual auction mechanism decreases energy and bandwidth resource consumption and effectively improves social welfare without sacrificing the throughput and the security of the wireless blockchain network. |

Accountable safety means that in any case of inconsistency, a certain fraction of validators can be identified to have provably violated the protocol. Earlier works have developed impossibility results and protocol constructions for these properties separately. We show that accountable safety implies finality, thereby unifying earlier results. |

DeFi aims to create a transparent and efficient financial ecosystem using smart contracts and emerging decentralized applications. However, the growing popularity of DeFi has made it a target for fraudulent activities, resulting in losses of billions of dollars due to various types of frauds. To address these issues, researchers have explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to detect such fraudulent activities. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic survey to organize and summarize those existing works and to identify the future research opportunities. In this survey, we provide a systematic taxonomy of various frauds in the DeFi ecosystem, categorized by the different stages of a DeFi project's life cycle: project development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This taxonomy is based on our finding: many frauds have strong correlations in the stage of the DeFi project. According to the taxonomy, we review existing AI-powered detection methods, including statistical modeling, natural language processing and other machine learning techniques, etc. We find that fraud detection in different stages employs distinct types of methods and observe the commendable performance of tree-based and graph-related models in tackling fraud detection tasks. By analyzing the challenges and trends, we present the findings to provide proactive suggestion and guide future research in DeFi fraud detection. We believe that this survey is able to support researchers, practitioners, and regulators in establishing a secure and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem. |

To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel collaborative learning framework designed to detect attacks in blockchain transactions and smart contracts by analyzing transaction features. Our framework exhibits the capability to classify various types of blockchain attacks, including intricate attacks at the machine code level (e.g., injecting malicious codes to withdraw coins from users unlawfully), which typically necessitate significant time and security expertise to detect. To achieve that, the proposed framework incorporates a unique tool that transforms transaction features into visual representations, facilitating efficient analysis and classification of low-level machine codes. Furthermore, we propose a customized collaborative learning model to enable real-time detection of diverse attack types at distributed mining nodes. In order to create a comprehensive dataset, we deploy a pilot system based on a private Ethereum network and conduct multiple attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the most comprehensive and diverse collection of transactions and smart contracts synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattack detection in blockchain systems. Our framework achieves a detection accuracy of approximately 94\% through extensive simulations and real-time experiments with a throughput of over 2,150 transactions per second. These compelling results validate the efficacy of our framework and showcase its adaptability in addressing real-world cyberattack scenarios. |

Therefore, this research proposes a blockchain platform to aid in managing kidneys in the supply chain. This framework establishes a secure system that meticulously tracks the organ's location and handling, safeguarding the health from donor to recipient. Additionally, a machine-learning algorithm is embedded to monitor organ health in real-time against various metrics for prompt detection of possible kidney damage. |

This is hindering the provisioning of quality-of-service guarantees for real-time applications like video calls and gaming, cloud-based systems, financial transactions, telesurgery, and other remote applications that benefit from reliable communication. This paper introduces Hummingbird, a novel lightweight inter-domain bandwidth-reservation system that addresses several shortcomings of previous designs.   Hummingbird supports flexible and composable reservations and enables end-to-end guarantees without requiring autonomous systems to manage reservations for their endhosts. Previous systems tied reservations to autonomous-system numbers or network addresses, which limits the flexibility of reservations. In contrast, our system decouples reservations from network identities and, as a result, the control plane from the data plane. This design choice facilitates multiple co-existing control-plane mechanisms and enables innovative approaches, such as a control plane based on blockchain smart contracts that offers tradeable bandwidth-reservation assets and end-to-end guarantees. The data-plane design ensures simplicity for efficient processing on border routers, which streamlines implementation, deployment, and traffic policing while maintaining robust security properties. |

We argue that transaction ordering techniques used for MEV extraction in blockchains where fees can influence the execution order do not directly apply to blockchains where the order is determined based on transactions' arrival times. Such blockchains' First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) nature can yield different optimization strategies for entities seeking MEV, known as searchers, requiring further study. This paper explores the applicability of MEV extraction techniques observed on Ethereum, a fee-based blockchain, to Algorand, an FCFS blockchain. Our results show the prevalence of arbitrage MEV getting extracted through backruns on pending transactions in the network, uniformly distributed to block positions. However, on-chain data do not reveal latency optimizations between specific MEV searchers and Algorand block proposers. We also study network clogging attacks and argue how searchers can exploit them as a viable ordering technique for MEV extraction in FCFS networks. |

Nevertheless, people are concerned about whether foundation model based AI systems are properly governed to ensure the trustworthiness and to prevent misuse that could harm humans, society and the environment. In this paper, we identify eight governance challenges of foundation model based AI systems regarding the three fundamental dimensions of governance: decision rights, incentives, and accountability. Furthermore, we explore the potential of blockchain as an architectural solution to address the challenges by providing a distributed ledger to facilitate decentralised governance. We present an architecture that demonstrates how blockchain can be leveraged to realise governance in foundation model based AI systems. |

In this paper, we aim to re-purpose the energy by replacing the hash function with real-life problems having commercial utility. We propose Chrisimos, a useful Proof-of-Work where miners are required to find a minimal dominating set for real-life graph instances. A miner who is able to output the smallest dominating set for the given graph within the block interval time wins the mining game. We also propose a new chain selection rule that ensures the security of the scheme. Thus our protocol also realizes a decentralized minimal dominating set solver for any graph instance. We provide formal proof of correctness and show via experimental results that the block interval time is within feasible bounds of hash-based PoW. |

However, these properties do not always generalize to a setting across multiple independent blockchains. Despite the growing number of existing blockchain platforms, there is a lack of an overarching framework whose components provide all of the necessary properties for practical cross-chain commerce. We present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework. BlockChain I/O introduces entities called cross-chain services to relay information between different blockchains. The proposed design ensures that cross-chain services cannot violate transaction safety, and they are furthermore disincentivized from other types of misbehavior through an audit system. BlockChain I/O uses native stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a decentralized ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating privacy. After presenting the core architecture of BlockChain I/O, we demonstrate how to use it to implement a cross-chain marketplace and discuss how its desirable properties continue to hold in the end-to-end system. Finally, we use experimental evaluations to demonstrate BlockChain I/O's practical performance. |

As this market rapidly evolves, it necessitates re-evaluating which cryptocurrencies command the market and steer the direction of blockchain technology. We implement a network-based cryptocurrency market analysis to investigate this changing landscape. We use novel hourly-resolution data and Kendall's Tau correlation to explore the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market. We observed critical differences in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies determined by our method compared to rankings derived from daily data and Pearson's correlation. This divergence emphasizes the potential information loss stemming from daily data aggregation and highlights the limitations of Pearson's correlation. Our findings show that in the early stages of this growth, Bitcoin held a leading role. However, during the 2021 bull run, the landscape changed drastically. We see that while Ethereum has emerged as the overall leader, it was FTT and its associated exchange, FTX, that greatly led to the increase at the beginning of the bull run. We also find that highly-influential cryptocurrencies are increasingly gaining a commanding influence over the market as time progresses, despite the growing number of cryptocurrencies making up the market. |
|**2023-12-21**|**Security Analysis of Smart Contract Migration from Ethereum to Arbitrum**|Xueyan Tang et.al.|[2307.14773](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14773)| When migrating smart contracts from one blockchain platform to another, there are potential security risks. This is because different blockchain platforms have different environments and characteristics for executing smart contracts. The focus of this paper is to study the security risks associated with the migration of smart contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum. We collected relevant data and analyzed smart contract migration cases to explore the differences between Ethereum and Arbitrum in areas such as Arbitrum cross-chain messaging, block properties, contract address alias, and gas fees. From the 36 types of smart contract migration cases we identified, we selected 4 typical types of cases and summarized their security risks. The research shows that smart contracts deployed on Ethereum may face certain potential security risks during migration to Arbitrum, mainly due to issues inherent in public blockchain characteristics, such as outdated off-chain data obtained by the inactive sequencer, logic errors based on time, the permission check failed, Denial of Service(DOS) attacks. To mitigate these security risks, we proposed avoidance methods and provided considerations for users and developers to ensure a secure migration process. It's worth noting that this study is the first to conduct an in-depth analysis of the secure migration of smart contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum. |

IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications.   We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6\% detection rate and mitigate 100\% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead. We followed responsible disclosure procedures, and our countermeasures are scheduled for deployment in the future versions of IPFS. |

The ultimate goal of this research is addressing several phenomena broadly classed under MEV with sandwich attacks as the canonical example. The literature has primarily viewed MEV as a problem arising from oversights in distributed systems and cryptographic protocol design and has attempted to address it with the standard tool sets from those disciplines. This paper argues that the impact of private mempools on markets and agent incentives renders analyses that do not consider the economic lens incomplete. The paper presents several observations across blockchains and traditional finance to justify this argument and highlight specific dynamics for future study. |

Winecoff et.al.|[2307.10222](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10222)| Proponents and developers of Web3 and blockchain argue that these technologies can revolutionize how people live and work by empowering individuals and distributing decision-making power. While technologists often have expansive hopes for what their technologies will accomplish over the long term, the practical challenges of developing, scaling, and maintaining systems amidst present-day constraints can compromise progress toward this vision. How technologists think about the technological future they hope to enable and how they navigate day-to-day issues impacts the form technologies take, their potential benefits, and their potential harms. In our current work, we aimed to explore the visions of Web3 and blockchain technologists and identify the immediate challenges that could threaten their visions. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 operators and professional investors in the Web3 and blockchain field. Our findings revealed that participants supported several ideological goals for their projects, with decentralization being a pivotal mechanism to enable user autonomy, distribute governance power, and promote financial inclusion. However, participants acknowledged the practical difficulties in fulfilling these promises, including the need for rapid technology development, conflicts of interest among stakeholders due to platform financing dynamics, and the challenge of expanding to mainstream users who may not share the "Web3 ethos." If negotiated ineffectively, these challenges could lead to negative outcomes, such as corrupt governance, increased inequality, and increased prevalence of scams and dubious investment schemes. While participants thought education, regulation, and a renewed commitment to the original blockchain ideals could alleviate some problems, they expressed skepticism about the potential of these solutions. |

Such discrepancies can lead to challenges in providing both privacy and accountability while maintaining accurate billing. To overcome these challenges, a universal cost splitting mechanism is proposed that prioritises privacy and accountability. It leverages a homomorphic encryption cryptosystem to provide privacy and employs blockchain technology to establish accountability. A dispute resolution mechanism is also introduced to minimise the occurrence of erroneous bill calculations while ensuring accountability and non-repudiation throughout the billing process. Our evaluation demonstrates that PA-Bill offers an effective billing mechanism that maintains privacy and accountability in peer-to-peer energy markets utilising a semi-decentralised approach. |

In these applications, each user maintains a relevant subset of the committed messages and the corresponding opening proofs with the goal of ensuring a succinct global state. When the messages are updated, users are given some global update information and update their opening proofs to match the new vector commitment. We investigate the relation between the size of the update information and the runtime complexity needed to update an individual opening proof. Existing vector commitment schemes require that either the information size or the runtime scale linearly in the number $k$ of updated state elements. We construct a vector commitment scheme that asymptotically achieves both length and runtime that is sublinear in $k$, namely $k^\nu$ and $k^{1-\nu}$ for any $\nu \in (0,1)$. We prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the relation between the update information size and runtime complexity that shows the asymptotic optimality of our scheme. For $\nu = 1/2$, our constructions outperform Verkle commitments by about a factor of $2$ in terms of both the update information size and runtime, but makes use of larger public parameters. |

This constitutes a major flaw discovered with the introduction of decentralized finance and allows miners to perform MEV attacks. In this paper, we address the issue of sandwich attacks by providing a construction that takes as input a blockchain protocol and outputs a new blockchain protocol with the same security but in which sandwich attacks are not profitable. Furthermore, our protocol is fully decentralized with no trusted third parties or heavy cryptography primitives and carries a linear increase in latency and minimum computation overhead. |

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is pivotal in this regard, offering an exhaustive inventory of components and dependencies crucial to software development. However, prevalent challenges in SBOM sharing, such as data tampering risks and vendors' reluctance to fully disclose sensitive information, significantly hinder its effective implementation. These challenges pose a notable threat to the security of critical infrastructure and systems where transparency and trust are paramount, underscoring the need for a more secure and flexible mechanism for SBOM sharing. To bridge the gap, this study introduces a blockchain-empowered architecture for SBOM sharing, leveraging verifiable credentials to allow for selective disclosure. This strategy not only heightens security but also offers flexibility. Furthermore, this paper broadens the remit of SBOM to encompass AI systems, thereby coining the term AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). The advent of AI and its application in critical infrastructure necessitates a nuanced understanding of AI software components, including their origins and interdependencies. The evaluation of our solution indicates the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed SBOM sharing mechanism, positing a solution for safeguarding (AI) software supply chains, which is essential for the resilience and reliability of modern critical infrastructure systems. |

Our central assumption is that trades are batched before execution. Because of competition between arbitrageurs, the FM-AMM eliminates arbitrage profits (or LVR) and sandwich attacks, currently the two main problems in decentralized finance and blockchain design more broadly. We then consider 11 token pairs and use Binance price data to simulate the lower bound to the return of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM. Such a lower bound is, for the most part, slightly higher than the empirical returns of providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 (currently the dominant AMM). |
|**2023-10-03**|**Transaction Fee Mechanism Design with Active Block Producers**|Maryam Bahrani et.al.|[2307.01686](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01686)| The incentive-compatibility properties of blockchain transaction fee mechanisms have been investigated with *passive* block producers that are motivated purely by the net rewards earned at the consensus layer. This paper introduces a model of *active* block producers that have their own private valuations for blocks (representing, for example, additional value derived from the application layer). The block producer surplus in our model can be interpreted as one of the more common colloquial meanings of the term ``MEV.''   The main results of this paper show that transaction fee mechanism design is fundamentally more difficult with active block producers than with passive ones: with active block producers, no non-trivial or approximately welfare-maximizing transaction fee mechanism can be incentive-compatible for both users and block producers. These results can be interpreted as a mathematical justification for the current interest in augmenting transaction fee mechanisms with additional components such as order flow auctions, block producer competition, trusted hardware, or cryptographic techniques. |
|**2024-03-28**|**With Trail to Follow: Measurements of Real-world Non-fungible Token Phishing Attacks on Ethereum**|Jingjing Yang et.al.|[2307.01579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01579)| With the popularity of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), NFTs have become a new target of phishing attacks, posing a significant threat to the NFT trading ecosystem. There has been growing anecdotal evidence that new means of NFT phishing attacks have emerged in Ethereum ecosystem. Most of the existing research focus on detecting phishing scam accounts for native cryptocurrency on the blockchain, but there is a lack of research in the area of phishing attacks of emerging NFTs. Although a few studies have recently started to focus on the analysis and detection of NFT phishing attacks, NFT phishing attack means are diverse and little has been done to understand these various types of NFT phishing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct case retrospective analysis and measurement study of real-world historical NFT phishing attacks on Ethereum. By manually analyzing the existing scams reported by Chainabuse, we classify NFT phishing attacks into four patterns. For each pattern, we further investigate the tricks and working principles of them. Based on 469 NFT phishing accounts collected up until October 2022 from multiple channels, we perform a measurement study of on-chain transaction data crawled from Etherscan to characterizing NFT phishing scams by analyzing the modus operandi and preferences of NFT phishing scammers, as well as economic impacts and whereabouts of stolen NFTs. We classify NFT phishing transactions into one of the four patterns by log parsing and transaction record parsing. We find these phishing accounts stole 19,514 NFTs for a total profit of 8,858.431 ETH (around 18.57 million dollars). We also observe that scammers remain highly active in the last two years and favor certain categories and series of NFTs, accompanied with signs of gang theft. |

When realizing such an application, data might be stored and retrieved from one or more blockchains by distributed network nodes without relying on centralized coordination and trusted third parties. Data access could be provided through a query language such as SQL at the application level, establishing a unified view on application-level data that is verifiably stored. However, when accessing multiple blockchains through their node software and APIs, interoperability cannot be assumed today, resulting in challenges of inhomogeneous data access. In addition, different feature sets and trade-offs exist, e.g., regarding smart contract functionality, availability, distribution, scalability, and security. For increasing interoperability, the paper at hand suggests pursuing the development of a cross-chain query language at the application level. The language abstracts from implementation by providing a standardized syntax, an integrated data model, and a processing architecture for data queries. This research is an extended and updated paper of a prior publication demonstrating the language syntax, data model, and architecture with an evaluation of compatibility against the largest open and permissionless blockchains today. |

However, most existing FL approaches rely on a centralized server for global model aggregation, leading to a single point of failure. This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that our framework is robust against malicious client-side behaviors. |

Double-spending is a problem where the same tender is spent multiple times during a digital currency transaction, while selfish mining is an intentional alteration of a blockchain to increase rewards to one miner or a group of miners. We introduce a new attack that combines both these attacks and propose a machine learning-based solution to mitigate the risks associated with them. Specifically, we use the learning automaton, a powerful online learning method, to develop two models, namely the SDTLA and WVBM, which can effectively defend against selfish mining attacks. Our experimental results show that the SDTLA method increases the profitability threshold of selfish mining up to 47 $\%$, while the WVBM method performs even better and is very close to the ideal situation where each miner's revenue is proportional to their shared hash processing power. Additionally, we demonstrate that both methods can effectively reduce the risks of double-spending by tuning the $Z$ Parameter. Our findings highlight the potential of SDTLA and WVBM as promising solutions for enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain networks. |

However, repositioning is costly, because LPs have to pay gas fees for each update. We analyze the causal relation between repositioning and liquidity concentration around the market price, using the entry of blockchain scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Polygon, as our instruments. Lower gas fees on scaling solutions allow LPs to update more frequently than on Ethereum. Our results demonstrate that higher repositioning intensity and precision lead to greater liquidity concentration, which benefits small trades by reducing their slippage. |

Here we present a grassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social networks termed Grassroots Social Networking that aims to address this challenge. The architecture is geared for people with networked smartphones -- roaming (address-changing) computing devices communicating over an unreliable network (e.g., using UDP). The architecture incorporates (i) a decentralized social graph, where each person controls, maintains and stores only their local neighborhood in the graph; (iii) personal feeds, with authors and followers who create and store the feeds; and (ii) a grassroots dissemination protocol, in which communication among people occurs only along the edges of their social graph. The architecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a partially-ordered conflict-free counterpart of the totally-ordered conflict-based blockchain. We provide two example Grassroots Social Networking protocols -- Twitter-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their security (safety, liveness and privacy), spam/bot/deep-fake resistance, and implementation, demonstrating how server-based social networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture. |
|**2024-06-03**|**Evaluating and Managing Tokenomics for Non-Fungible Tokens in Game-Based Blockchain Networks**|Hyoungsung Kim et.al.|[2306.13672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13672)| Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming increasingly popular in Play-to-Earn (P2E) Web3 applications as a means of incentivizing user engagement. In Web3, users with NFTs ownership are entitled to monetize them. However, due to lack of objective NFT valuation, which makes NFT value determination challenging, P2E applications ecosystems have experienced inflation. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NFT inflation value management in P2E applications. Our method leverages the contribution-rewards model proposed by Curve Finance and the automated market maker (AMM) of decentralized exchanges. In decentralized systems, P2E Web3 applications inclusive, not all participants contribute in good faith. Therefore, rewards are provided to incentivize contribution. Our mechanism proves that burning NFTs, indicating the permanent removal of NFTs, contributes to managing inflation by reducing the number of NFTs in circulation. As a reward for this contribution, our method mints a compensation (CP) token as an ERC-20 token, which can be exchanged for NFTs once enough tokens have been accumulated. To further increase the value of the CP token, we suggest using governance tokens and CP tokens to create liquidity pools for AMM. The value of the governance token is determined by the market, and the CP token derives its value from the governance token in AMM. The CP token can determine its worth based on the market value of the governance token. Additionally, since CP tokens are used for exchanging NFTs, the value of the NFT is ultimately determined by the value of the CP token. To further illustrate our concept, we show how to adjust burning rewards based on factors such as the probability of upgrading NFTs' rarity or the current swap ratio of governance and CP tokens in AMM. |

In traditional centralized federated learning, the selection of local nodes and the collection of learning results for each round are merged under the control of a central server. In contrast, in BCFL, all these processes are monitored and managed via smart contracts. Additionally, we propose an extension architecture to support both crossdevice and cross-silo federated learning scenarios. Furthermore, we implement and verify the architecture in a practical real-world Ethereum development environment. Our BCFL reference architecture provides significant flexibility and extensibility, accommodating the integration of various additional elements, as per specific requirements and use cases, thereby rendering it an adaptable solution for a wide range of BCFL applications. As a prominent example of extensibility, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) have been employed as an authentication method to introduce practical utilization within BCFL. This study not only bridges a crucial gap between research and practical deployment but also lays a solid foundation for future explorations in the realm of BCFL. The pivotal contribution of this study is the successful implementation and verification of a realistic BCFL reference architecture. We intend to make the source code publicly accessible shortly, fostering further advancements and adaptations within the community. |

Among the methods for semantically representing agents, one has been essentially achieved by taking a behaviouristic vision, through which one can describe how they operate and engage with their peers. The approach essentially aims at defining the operational capabilities of agents through the mental states related with the achievement of tasks. The OASIS ontology -- An Ontology for Agent, Systems, and Integration of Services, presented in 2019 -- pursues the behaviouristic approach to deliver a semantic representation system and a communication protocol for agents and their commitments. This paper reports on the main modeling choices concerning the representation of agents in OASIS 2, the latest major upgrade of OASIS, and the achievement reached by the ontology since it was first introduced, in particular in the context of ontologies for blockchains. |

The popularity is partly due to their unique specifications originating from blockchain-related characteristics such as privacy, decentralisation, and untraceability. Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies remain a high-risk investment due to their price volatility and uncertainty. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with internal cryptocurrency-related factors and external influential global economic factors makes predicting their prices and price movement directions challenging. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from predicting the direction of cryptocurrency prices can provide valuable guidance for investors in making informed investment decisions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) approach, which can model complex systems in multivariate settings, to predict the price movement direction of five popular altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) in the next trading day. The efficacy of the proposed model in predicting cryptocurrency price directions is evaluated from two perspectives. Firstly, our proposed approach is compared to two baseline models, namely an auto-regressive integrated moving average and support vector regression. Secondly, from a feature engineering point of view, the impact of twenty-three different features, grouped into four categories, on the DBN's prediction performance is investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models. In addition, among the groups of features, technical indicators are found to be the most effective predictors of cryptocurrency price directions. |

By dividing the network into smaller components known as shards, a sharded blockchain can process transactions in parallel without introducing inconsistencies through the coordination of intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols. However, we observe a critical security issue with sharded systems: transaction ordering manipulations can occur when coordinating intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. Specifically, we identify a novel security issue known as finalization fairness, which can be exploited through a front-running attack. This attack allows an attacker to manipulate the execution order of transactions, even if the victim's transaction has already been processed and added to the blockchain by a fair intra-shard consensus.   To address the issue, we offer Haechi, a novel cross-shard protocol that is immune to front-running attacks. Haechi introduces an ordering phase between transaction processing and execution, ensuring that the execution order of transactions is the same as the processing order and achieving finalization fairness. To accommodate different consensus speeds among shards, Haechi incorporates a finalization fairness algorithm to achieve a globally fair order with minimal performance loss. By providing a global order, Haechi ensures strong consistency among shards, enabling better parallelism in handling conflicting transactions across shards. These features make Haechi a promising solution for supporting popular smart contracts in the real world. To evaluate Haechi's performance, we implemented the protocol using Tendermint and conducted extensive experiments on a geo-distributed AWS environment. Our results demonstrate that Haechi achieves finalization fairness with little performance sacrifice compared to existing cross-shard consensus protocols. |

|**2024-03-06**|**Sustainable AI Regulation**|Philipp Hacker et.al.|[2306.00292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00292)| Current proposals for AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, aim to spur AI that is trustworthy (e.g., AI Act) and accountable (e.g., AI Liability) What is missing, however, is a robust regulatory discourse and roadmap to make AI, and technology more broadly, environmentally sustainable. This paper aims to take first steps to fill this gap. The ICT sector contributes up to 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-more than global air travel at 2.5 percent. The carbon footprint and water consumption of AI, especially large-scale generative models like GPT-4, raise significant sustainability concerns. The paper is the first to assess how current and proposed technology regulations, including EU environmental law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the AI Act, could be adjusted to better account for environmental sustainability. The GDPR, for instance, could be interpreted to limit certain individual rights like the right to erasure if these rights significantly conflict with broader sustainability goals. In a second step, the paper suggests a multi-faceted approach to achieve sustainable AI regulation. It advocates for transparency mechanisms, such as disclosing the GHG footprint of AI systems, as laid out in the proposed EU AI Act. However, sustainable AI regulation must go beyond mere transparency. The paper proposes a regulatory toolkit comprising co-regulation, sustainability-by-design principles, restrictions on training data, and consumption caps, including integration into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Finally, the paper argues that this regulatory toolkit could serve as a blueprint for regulating other high-emission technologies and infrastructures like blockchain, Metaverse applications, and data centers. The framework aims to cohesively address the crucial dual challenges of our era: digital transformation and climate change mitigation. |

We propose to use a variant, called coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum Proof-of-Work (PoW) scheme for blockchain consensus. The users perform boson-sampling using input states that depend on the current block information, and commit their samples to the network. Afterward, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to both validate samples and to reward successful miners. By combining rewards to miners committing honest samples together with penalties to miners committing dishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivizes honest nodes. The scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling and provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by classical hardware. |

They are software programs that run on top of a blockchain, and we may need to change them from time to time (e.g., to fix bugs or address new use cases). Governance protocols define the means for amending or changing these smart contracts without any centralized authority. They distribute the decision-making power to every user of the smart contract: Users vote on accepting or rejecting every change.   In this work, we review and characterize decentralized governance in practice, using Compound and Uniswap -- two widely used governance protocols -- as a case study. We reveal a high concentration of voting power in both Compound and Uniswap: 10 voters hold together 57.86% and 44.72% of the voting power, respectively. Although proposals to change or amend the protocol receive, on average, a substantial number of votes (i.e., 89.39%) in favor within the Compound protocol, they require fewer than three voters to obtain 50% or more votes. We show that voting on Compound proposals can be unfairly expensive for small token holders, and we discover voting coalitions that can further marginalize these users. |

A drawback of this design is that when users submit a transaction, they cannot predict in which state it will be executed. This exposes them to transaction-ordering attacks, a widespread class of attacks where adversaries with the power to construct blocks of transactions can extract value from smart contracts (the so-called MEV attacks). The UTXO model is an alternative blockchain design that thwarts these attacks by requiring new transactions to spend past ones: since transactions have unique identifiers, reordering attacks are ineffective. Currently, the blockchains following the UTXO model either provide contracts with limited expressiveness (Bitcoin), or require complex run-time environments (Cardano). We present ILLUM , an Intermediate-Level Language for the UTXO Model. ILLUM can express real-world smart contracts, e.g. those found in Decentralized Finance. We define a compiler from ILLUM to a bare-bone UTXO blockchain with loop-free scripts. Our compilation target only requires minimal extensions to Bitcoin Script: in particular, we exploit covenants, a mechanism for preserving scripts along chains of transactions. We prove the security of our compiler: namely, any attack targeting the compiled contract is also observable at the ILLUM level. Hence, the compiler does not introduce new vulnerabilities that were not already present in the source ILLUM contract. We evaluate the practicality of ILLUM as a compilation target for higher-level languages. To this purpose, we implement a compiler from a contract language inspired by Solidity to ILLUM, and we apply it to a benchmark or real-world smart contracts. |

While not an issue initially, the emergence of decentralized finance has introduced new transaction order dependencies allowing parties in control of the ordering to make a profit by front-running others' transactions. In this work, we present the Decentralized Clock Network, a new approach for achieving fair transaction ordering. Users submit their transactions to the network's clocks, which run an agreement protocol that provides each transaction with a timestamp of receipt which is then used to define the transactions' order. By separating agreement from ordering, our protocol is efficient and has a simpler design compared to other available solutions. Moreover, our protocol brings to the blockchain world the paradigm of asynchronous fallback, where the algorithm operates with stronger fairness guarantees during periods of synchronous use, switching to an asynchronous mode only during times of increased network delay. |

Absolute commitments allow the strategy of an agent to depend on the commitments made by the other agents. This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game in which agents choose which strategies they commit to.   We say that a game that is unaffected by such commitments is Stackelberg resilient and show that computing it is intractible in general, although it can be computed efficiently for two-player games of perfect information. We show the intuitive, but technically non-trivial result, that, if a game is resilient when some number of players have the capacity to make commitments, it is also resilient when these commitments are available to fewer players. We demonstrate the non-triviality of Stackelberg resilience by analyzing two escrow mechanisms from the literature. These mechanisms have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient.   Our model is particularly relevant in Web3 scenarios, where these absolute commitments can be realized by the automated and irrevocable nature of smart contracts. Our work highlights an important issue in ensuring the secure design of Web3. In particular, our work suggests that smart contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks. |

Changing these rules can be risky and challenging. In addition, it can often be controversial and take much effort to make all the necessary participants agree to adopt a change. Arguably, Bitcoin has seen centralisation tendencies in pools and in development. However, how these tendencies influence blockchain governance has received minimal community and academic attention. Our study analyses the governmental structures in a blockchain by looking into the history of Bitcoin. We investigate the process of changing consensus rules through a grounded theory analysis comprising quantitative and qualitative data from 34 consensus forks in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The results reveal the decentralised behaviour in Bitcoin and blockchain. Our results are in contrast to related work, emphasising centralisation among miners and developers. Furthermore, our results show how the consensus-driven deployment techniques and governance of consensus rules are intertwined. |

To cope with the challenges of 4IR, there is a need for innovative and sustainable teaching and learning tools. AI and block chain technologies hold great promise in this regard, with potential benefits such as personalized learning, secure credentialing, and decentralized learning networks. This paper presents a review of existing research on AI and block chain in education, analyzing case studies and exploring the potential benefits and challenges of these technologies. The paper also suggests a unique model for integrating AI and block chain into sustainable teaching and learning practices. Future research directions are discussed, including the need for more empirical studies and the exploration of ethical and social implications. The key summary of this discussion is that, by enhancing accessibility, efficacy, and security in education, AI and blockchain have the potential to revolutionise the field. In order to ensure that students can benefit from these potentially game-changing technologies as technology develops, it will be crucial to find ways to harness its power while minimising hazards. Overall, this paper highlights the potential of AI and block chain as sustainable tools for teaching and learning in the 4IR era and their respective advantages, issues and future prospects have been discussed in this writing. |

|**2024-03-03**|**Permissionless Consensus**|Andrew Lewis-Pye et.al.|[2304.14701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14701)| Blockchain protocols typically aspire to run in the permissionless setting, in which nodes are owned and operated by a large number of diverse and unknown entities, with each node free to start or stop running the protocol at any time. This setting is more challenging than the traditional permissioned setting, in which the set of nodes that will be running the protocol is fixed and known at the time of protocol deployment. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework for reasoning about the rich design space of blockchain protocols and their capabilities and limitations in the permissionless setting.   We propose a hierarchy of settings with different "degrees of permissionlessness", specified by the amount of knowledge that a protocol has about the current participants: These are the fully permissionless, dynamically available and quasi-permissionless settings.   The paper also proves several results illustrating the utility of our analysis framework for reasoning about blockchain protocols in these settings. For example:   (1) In the fully permissionless setting, even with synchronous communication and with severe restrictions on the total size of the Byzantine players, every deterministic protocol for Byzantine agreement has a non-terminating execution.   (2) In the dynamically available and partially synchronous setting, no protocol can solve the Byzantine agreement problem with high probability, even if there are no Byzantine players at all.   (3) In the quasi-permissionless and partially synchronous setting, by contrast, assuming a bound on the total size of the Byzantine players, there is a deterministic protocol solving state machine replication.   (4) In the quasi-permissionless and synchronous setting, every proof-of-stake state machine replication protocol that uses only time-malleable cryptographic primitives is vulnerable to long-range attacks. |
|**2024-04-18**|**Resource Specifications for Resource-Manipulating Programs**|Zachary Grannan et.al.|[2304.12530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12530)| Specifications for modular program verifiers are expressed as constraints on program states (e.g. preconditions) and relations on program states (e.g. postconditions). For programs whose domain is managing resources of any kind (e.g. cryptocurrencies), such state-based specifications must make explicit properties that a human would implicitly understand for free. For example, it's clear that depositing into your bank account will not change other balances, but classically this must be stated as a frame condition. As a result, classical specifications for resource-manipulating programs quickly become verbose and difficult to interpret, write and debug.   In this paper, we present a novel methodology that extends a modular program verifier to support user-defined first-class resources, allowing resource-related operations and properties to be expressed directly and eliminating the need to reify implicit knowledge in the specifications. We implement our methodology as an extension of the program verifier Prusti, and use it to verify real-world smart contracts and a key part of a blockchain application. Our evaluation demonstrates that specifications written with our methodology are more concise and substantially simpler than specifications written purely in terms of program states. |

Fiber communication lines and satellite-to-ground links have served as the basis for the most successful quantum networks that have been developed so far. Using a UAV, satellite or both for free-space quantum communication reduces the need for permanent ground connections and takes advantage of the lower loss limit in space, which makes it more efficient. This work surveys the recent development in Quantum Satellites and Quantum UAVs-based networks. Here, the importance of the latest technologies, including quantum artificial intelligence, blockchain quantum machine learning, quantum satellites and quantum UAVs, are explored from network perspectives. Further, this work discussed the role of satellite-based images and artificial intelligence. |

The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing. This paper presents a mathematics that is inspired by these considerations. It is interesting in and of itself, much like point-set topology is; and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems. |

State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security-performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC. |

Unlike existing applications like Kleros, privacy is ensured by design through the use of the zero-knowledge protocols Semaphore and MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure), which provide, among other things, resistance to Sybil-like attacks and corruption. Differently from Kleros, dispute resolution is guaranteed despite the users having the final say. Moreover, the proposed model does not use a native token on the platform, but aims to reward stakeholders through a social incentive mechanism based on soulbound tokens, introduced by Weyl, Ohlhaver, and Buterin in 2022. Users with these tokens will be considered trustworthy and will have the ability to govern the platform. As far as we know, this is one of the first blockchain projects that seeks to introduce social governance rather than one based on economic incentives. |
|**2024-04-21**|**Maximizing Miner Revenue in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Ke Wu et.al.|[2302.12895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12895)| Transaction fee mechanism design is a new decentralized mechanism design problem where users bid for space on the blockchain. Several recent works showed that the transaction fee mechanism design fundamentally departs from classical mechanism design. They then systematically explored the mathematical landscape of this new decentralized mechanism design problem in two settings: in the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a cryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by a multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior works showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for both users as well as miners (possibly colluding with users), then the miner revenue has to be zero. Although adopting a relaxed, approximate notion of incentive compatibility gets around this zero miner-revenue limitation, the scaling of the miner revenue is nonetheless poor.   In this paper, we show that if we make a mildly stronger reasonable-world assumption than prior works, we can circumvent the known limitations on miner revenue, and design auctions that generate optimal miner revenue. We also systematically explore the mathematical landscape of transaction fee mechanism design under the new reasonable-world and demonstrate how such assumptions can alter the feasibility and infeasibility landscape. |

In of-ABC, transactions submitted to a sufficient number of blockchain validators are ordered before or along with later transactions. FBA then executes transactions with a uniform price double auction that prioritizes price instead of transaction order within the same committed batch.   To demonstrate the merits of our order-but-not-execute-in-order design, we compare the welfare loss and liquidity provision in DEX under FBA and its continuous counterpart, the Continuous Limit Order Book (CLOB). Assuming that the exchange is realized over an of-ABC protocol, we find that (1) FBA always achieves better social welfare when no party is privately informed about asset valuations. Even otherwise, FBA incurs less welfare loss compared to CLOB when (2) price takers and public information reflecting asset value changes arrives sufficiently frequently compared to private information, or (3) the priority fees are small, or (4) the market is more balanced on both sides. Our empirical analysis on dYdX transactions indicates additional $8\%-83\%$ costs when transactions are executed continuously. Further, our findings also indicate that liquidity provision is better under FBA under similar conditions. |

Over the last year, \$100 million worth of NFTs were stolen by drainers, and their presence remains a serious threat to the NFT trading space. However, no work has yet comprehensively investigated the behaviors of drainers in the NFT ecosystem.   In this paper, we present the first study on the trading behavior of NFT drainers and introduce the first dedicated NFT drainer detection system. We collect 127M NFT transaction data from the Ethereum blockchain and 1,135 drainer accounts from five sources for the year 2022. We find that drainers exhibit significantly different transactional and social contexts from those of regular users. With these insights, we design \textit{DRAINCLoG}, an automatic drainer detection system utilizing Graph Neural Networks. This system effectively captures the multifaceted web of interactions within the NFT space through two distinct graphs: the NFT-User graph for transaction contexts and the User graph for social contexts. Evaluations using real-world NFT transaction data underscore the robustness and precision of our model. Additionally, we analyze the security of \textit{DRAINCLoG} under a wide variety of evasion attacks. |

PACCs allow any smart contract wallet holder to collateralize a claim, request, or commitment in general, in a private and anonymous manner. PACCs can prove arbitrarily much or little about the wallet generating the commitment, and/or the transaction which is being committed. We demonstrate that PACCs can be applied to effectively eliminate maximal-extractable value (MEV) in DeFi where it currently occurs, shifting MEV instead to censorship. After describing our protocol with detail, we provide an implementation using the Ethereum blockchain, and whose benchmarks prove how PACCs are completely feasible. |

As a result digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading to the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon the testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for digital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a use case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed within this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the findings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors and developers. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential impacts and risks of other technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing this study provides a primer for users to begin planning a digital inheritance strategy and for developers to develop a more intuitive solution. |
|**2024-06-10**|**The Synchronic Web**|Thien-Nam Dinh et.al.|[2301.10733](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10733)| The Synchronic Web is a distributed network for securing data provenance on the World Wide Web. By enabling clients around the world to freely commit digital information into a single shared view of history, it provides a foundational basis of truth on which to build decentralized and scalable trust across the Internet. Its core cryptographical capability allows mutually distrusting parties to create and verify statements of the following form: "I commit to this information--and only this information--at this moment in time." The backbone of the Synchronic Web infrastructure is a simple, small, and semantic-free blockchain that is accessible to any Internet-enabled entity. The infrastructure is maintained by a permissioned network of well-known servers, called notaries, and accessed by a permissionless group of clients, called ledgers. Through an evolving stack of flexible and composable semantic specifications, the parties cooperate to generate synchronic commitments over arbitrary data. When integrated with existing infrastructures, adapted to diverse domains, and scaled across the breadth of cyberspace, the Synchronic Web provides a ubiquitous mechanism to lock the world's data into unique points in discrete time and digital space. |

Grassroots applications are potentially important as they may allow people to conduct their social, economic, civic, and political lives in the digital realm solely using the networked computing devices they own and operate (e.g., smartphones), free of third-party control, surveillance, manipulation, coercion, or rent seeking (e.g., by global digital platforms such as Facebook or Bitcoin).   Here, we formalize the notion of grassroots systems and grassroots implementations; specify an abstract grassroots dissemination protocol; describe and prove an implementation of grassroots dissemination for the model of asynchrony; extend the implementation to mobile (address-changing) devices that communicate via an unreliable network (e.g. smartphones using UDP); and discuss how grassroots dissemination can realize applications that support digital sovereignty -- grassroots social networking and grassroots currencies. The mathematical construction employs distributed multiagent transition systems to define the notions of grassroots protocols and grassroots implementations, to specify grassroots dissemination protocols and their implementation, and to prove their correctness. The implementation uses the blocklace -- a generalization of the blockchain that functions as a fault-tolerant, conflict-free replicated data type. |

However, the integration of these devices brings many security issues. To address these concerns, Blockchain technology has been widely adopted due to its robust security characteristics, including immutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing blockchain within these networks is highly challenging due to the limited resources of the employed devices and the resource-intensive requirements of the blockchain. To overcome these challenges, a multitude of researchers have proposed lightweight blockchain solutions specifically designed for resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of lightweight blockchain solutions proposed in the literature. More precisely, we identify five areas within the "lightweight" concept, namely, blockchain architecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm, and storage method. We discuss the various methods employed in each "lightweight" category, highlighting existing gaps and identifying areas for improvement. Our review highlights the missing points in existing systems and paves the way to building a complete lightweight blockchain solution for networks of resource-constrained devices. |

State-of-the-art ORUs employ a monolithic dispute resolution protocol that tightly couples an L1 referee with a specific L2 client binary--oblivious to the system's higher-level semantics. We argue that this approach (1) magnifies monoculture failure risk, by precluding trust-minimized and permissionless participation using operator-chosen client software; (2) leads to an unnecessarily large and difficult-to-audit TCB; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered, yet opaque upgrade process--both further increasing auditing overhead, and broadening the governance attack surface. To address these concerns, we outline a methodology for designing a secure and resilient ORU with a minimal TCB, by facilitating opportunistic 1-of-N-version programming. Due to its unique challenges and opportunities, we ground this work concretely in the context of the Ethereum ecosystem--where ORUs have gained significant traction. Specifically, we design a semantically-aware proof system, natively targeting the EVM and its instruction set. We present an implementation in a new ORU, Specular, that opportunistically leverages Ethereum's existing client diversity with minimal source modification, demonstrating our approach's feasibility. |
|**2023-11-17**|**Formal Model-Driven Analysis of Resilience of GossipSub to Attacks from Misbehaving Peers**|Ankit Kumar et.al.|[2212.05197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05197)| GossipSub is a new peer-to-peer communication protocol designed to counter attacks from misbehaving peers by controlling what information is sent and to whom, via a score function computed by each peer that captures positive and negative behaviors of its neighbors. The score function depends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds) that can be configured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is written in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is supported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.   In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience of GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model of GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed by the GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security properties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior, and rewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can be configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad behavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations for two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains. We show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0 network (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving peers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously misbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores so that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub. |

Powerful players, such as miners, sequencers, and sophisticated bots, can reap significant profits by selectively including, excluding, or re-ordering user transactions. Such profits are called Miner/Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. MEV bears profound implications for blockchain security and decentralization. While numerous countermeasures have been proposed, there is no agreement on the best solution. Moreover, solutions developed in academic literature differ quite drastically from what is widely adopted by practitioners. For these reasons, this paper systematizes the knowledge of the theory and practice of MEV countermeasures. The contribution is twofold. First, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of 30 proposed MEV countermeasures, covering four different technical directions. Secondly, we empirically studied the most popular MEV-auction-based solution with rich blockchain and mempool data. We also present the Mempool Guru system, a public service system that collects, persists, and analyzes the Ethereum mempool data for research. In addition to gaining insights into MEV auction platforms' real-world operations, our study shed light on the prevalent censorship by MEV auction platforms as a result of the recent OFAC sanction, and its implication on blockchain properties. |

The digital era offers a shift towards unique digital identifiers for each citizen, enabling a 'citizen wallet' for easier access to personal documents like academic records and licences, with enhanced security through digital signatures. The European Commission's initiative for a digital wallet for every EU citizen aims to improve mobility and integration, leveraging the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) for harmonised citizen integration. This paper discusses how EBSI and the GLASS project can advance governance and streamline access to identity documents. |

We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$ . |

However, the inherent characteristics of blockchain hinder decentralized finance (DeFi) from accessing necessary sensitive user data. To address this challenge, we introduce a protocol that both safeguards user privacy and ensures data availability through the incorporation of homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge-proof techniques in blockchain technology. This novel protocol helps mitigate privacy risks caused by sensitive data leaks while improving the capital efficiency of the DeFi market. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of these privacy-preserving methods in on-chain ecosystems and cross-border financial applications. Our solution contributes to secure, user-centric solutions for DeFi while upholding principles of decentralization and privacy protection. |

Each network node of a blockchain may use a true random number generator (TRNG) and hash algorism to fulfil the PoR protocol. In this whitepaper, we give the consensus mechanism of the PoR protocol, and classify it into a new kind of randomized algorithms called Macau. The PoR protocol could generate a blockchain without any competition of computing power or stake of cryptocurrency. Besides, we give some advantages of integrating quantum random number generator (QRNG) chips into hardware wallets, and also discuss the way to cooperate with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology. |
|**2023-10-31**|**BDTS: Blockchain-based Data Trading System**|Erya Jiang et.al.|[2211.10001](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10001)| Trading data through blockchain platforms is hard to achieve \textit{fair exchange}. Reasons come from two folds: Firstly, guaranteeing fairness between sellers and consumers is a challenging task as the deception of any participating parties is risk-free. This leads to the second issue where judging the behavior of data executors (such as cloud service providers) among distrustful parties is impractical in the context of traditional trading protocols. To fill the gaps, in this paper, we present a \underline{b}lockchain-based \underline{d}ata \underline{t}rading \underline{s}ystem, named BDTS. BDTS implements a fair-exchange protocol in which benign behaviors can get rewarded while dishonest behaviors will be punished. Our scheme requires the seller to provide consumers with the correct encryption keys for proper execution and encourage a rational data executor to behave faithfully for maximum benefits from rewards. We analyze the strategies of consumers, sellers, and dealers in the trading game and point out that everyone should be honest about their interests so that the game will reach Nash equilibrium. Evaluations prove efficiency and practicability. |

For meaningful security, $T$ can be at most subexponential in the security parameter $\lambda$ but has no lower bound. VDFs are useful in several applications ranging from randomness beacons to sustainable blockchains but are really rare in practice. The verification in all of these VDFs requires $\Omega(\lambda, \log{T})$ sequential time. This paper derives a verifiable delay function that is verifiable in $O(1)$-sequential time. The key observation is that the prior works use subexponentially-hard algebraic assumptions for their sequentiality. On the contrary, we derive our VDF from a polynomially-hard sequential assumption namely the time-lock puzzle over the group of known order. In particular, we show that time-lock puzzle can be sequentially-hard even when the order of the group is known but the delay parameter is polynomially-bounded i.e., $T \le \mathtt{poly}(\lambda)$. As an add-on advantage, our VDF requires only one sequential squaring to verify. Thus, in our VDF, the sequential effort required for verification is fixed and independent of the delay parameter $T$ . |

Decentralization is achieved by the blockchain, a permanent public ledger that contains a record of every transaction. The public ledger ensures transparency, which enables public verifiability but harms untraceability, fungibility, and anonymity. In the last decade, cryptocurrencies attracted millions of users, with their total market cap reaching approximately three trillion USD at its peak. However, their anonymity guarantees are poorly understood and plagued by widespread misbeliefs. Indeed, previous notions of privacy, anonymity, and traceability for cryptocurrencies are either non-quantitative or inapplicable, e.g., computationally hard to measure.   In this work, we put forward a formal framework to measure the (un)traceability and anonymity of cryptocurrencies, allowing us to quantitatively reason about the mixing characteristics of cryptocurrencies and the privacy-enhancing technologies built on top of them. Our methods apply absorbing Markov chains combined with Shannon entropy. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first practical, efficient, and probabilistic measure to assess the traceability of cryptocurrencies quantitatively, which also generalizes to entire cryptocurrency transaction graphs. We implement and extensively evaluate our proposed traceability measure on several cryptocurrency transaction graphs. Among other quantitative results, we find that in the studied one-week interval, the Bitcoin blockchain, on average, provided comparable but quantifiably more natural mixing than the Ethereum blockchain. |
|**2024-04-15**|**SoK: A Stratified Approach to Blockchain Decentralization**|Christina Ovezik et.al.|[2211.01291](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01291)| Decentralization has been touted as the principal security advantage which propelled blockchain systems at the forefront of developments in the financial technology space. Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered by existing systems. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and it enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics ("tokenomics"), (6) client API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. We also introduce a practical test, the "Minimum Decentralization Test" which can provide quick insights about the decentralization state of a blockchain system. To demonstrate how our stratified methodology can be used in practice, we apply it fully (layer by layer) to Bitcoin, and we provide examples of systems which comprise one or more "problematic" layers that cause them to fail the MDT. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, and suggests various potential directions where future research is needed. |

Recently, a large number of criminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing graph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on constructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the heterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction pattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can depict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally neglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real behavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation (TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based transaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed module can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection methods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the Ethereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal information for Ponzi scheme detection. |

Ethereum, which wished to keep the best of the two protocol designs (BFT and Nakomoto-style), now has a convoluted consensus protocol as its core. The result is a blockchain being possibly produced in a tree-like form while participants try to finalize blocks. We categorize different attacks jeopardizing the liveness of the protocol. The Ethereum community has responded by creating patches against some of them. We discovered a new attack on the patched protocol. To support our analysis, we propose a new high-level formalization of the properties of liveness and availability of the Ethereum blockchain, and we provide a pseudo-code. We believe this formalization to be helpful for other analyses as well. Our results yield that the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake has safety but only probabilistic liveness. The probability of the liveness is influenced by the parameter describing the time frame allowed for validators to change their mind about the current main chain. |

Existing solutions to boost the trust using a stronger blockchain, e.g., via checkpointing, requires the weaker blockchain to give up sovereignty. In this paper, we propose a family of protocols in which multiple blockchains interact to create a combined ledger with boosted trust. We show that even if several of the interacting blockchains cease to provide security guarantees, the combined ledger continues to be secure - our TrustBoost protocols achieve the optimal threshold of tolerating the insecure blockchains. This optimality, along with the necessity of blockchain interactions, is formally shown within the classic shared memory model, tackling the long standing open challenge of solving consensus in the presence of both Byzantine objects and processes. Furthermore, our proposed construction of TrustBoost simply operates via smart contracts and require no change to the underlying consensus protocols of the participating blockchains, a form of ``consensus on top of consensus''. The protocols are lightweight and can be used on specific (e.g., high value) transactions; we demonstrate the practicality by implementing and deploying TrustBoost as cross-chain smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem using approximately 3,000 lines of Rust code, made available as open source. Our evaluation shows that using 10 Cosmos chains in a local testnet, TrustBoost has a gas cost of roughly $2 with a latency of 2 minutes per request, which is in line with the cost on a high security chain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum |

Constant function market makers (CFMMs) are another market design innovation praised for their computational simplicity and applicability to liquidity provision via smart contracts. Liquidity provision in batch exchanges is an important problem, and CFMMs have recently shown promise in being useful within batch exchanges. Different real-world implementations have used fundamentally different approaches towards integrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, and there is a lack of formal understanding of different design tradeoffs.   We first provide a minimal set of axioms that are well-accepted rules of batch exchanges and CFMMs. These are asset conservation, uniform valuations, a best response for limit orders, and non-decreasing CFMM trading function. In general, many market solutions may satisfy all our axioms. We then describe several economically useful properties of market solutions. These include Pareto optimality for limit orders, price coherence of CFMMs (as a defence against cyclic arbitrage), joint price discovery for CFMMs (as a defence against parallel running), path independence for simple instances, and a locally computable response of the CFMMs in equilibrium (to provide them predictability on trade size given a market price). We show fundamental conflicts between some pairs of these properties. We then provide two ways of integrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, which attain different subsets of these properties. We further provide a convex program for computing Arrow-Debreu exchange market equilibria when all agents have weak gross substitute (WGS) demand functions on two assets -- this program extends the literature on Arrow-Debreu exchange markets and may be of independent interest. |

|**2024-03-04**|**Bayesian Mechanism Design for Blockchain Transaction Fee Allocation**|Xi Chen et.al.|[2209.13099](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13099)| In blockchain systems, the design of transaction fee mechanisms is essential for stability and satisfaction for both miners and users. A recent work has proven the impossibility of collusion-proof mechanisms that achieve both non-zero miner revenue and Dominating-Strategy-Incentive-Compatible (DSIC) for users. However, a positive miner revenue is important in practice to motivate miners. To address this challenge, we consider a Bayesian game setting and relax the DSIC requirement for users to Bayesian-Nash-Incentive-Compatibility (BNIC). In particular, we propose an auxiliary mechanism method that makes connections between BNIC and DSIC mechanisms. With the auxiliary mechanism method, we design a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) based on the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, and prove that the TFM has both BNIC and collusion-proof properties with an asymptotic constant-factor approximation of optimal miner revenue for i.i.d. bounded valuations. Our result breaks the zero-revenue barrier while preserving truthfulness and collusion-proof properties. |
|**2024-02-07**|**Mass Exit Attacks on the Lightning Network**|Cosimo Sguanci et.al.|[2208.01908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01908)| The Lightning Network (LN) has enjoyed rapid growth over recent years, and has become the most popular scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. The security of the LN relies on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by settling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain within a pre-agreed time period. We study the susceptibility of the LN to mass exit attacks in case of high transaction congestion, in the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes that forces a large set of honest users to interact with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first is a zombie attack, where a set of k nodes become unresponsive with the goal of locking the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than what the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a mass double-spend attack, where a set of k nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many closing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this causes many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating transactions. We show via simulations that, under historically plausible congestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances, both attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our simulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of k adversarial nodes as a graph cut problem. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical justifications based on the scale-free topology of the LN. |

Despite these concerns, policy interventions targeting cryptocurrency operations in the pursuit of sustainability have largely been ineffective. Some were abandoned for fear of jeopardizing innovation, whereas others failed due to the highly globalized nature of blockchain systems. In search of a more effective angle for energy policy measures, this study adopts a consumer-centric perspective, examining the sentiments of Nigerian cryptocurrency users ( ${n=158}$ ) toward Bitcoin's sustainability, a representative cryptocurrency known for its high electricity demand. Three main findings emerged: 1) Even among those self-identifying as highly knowledgeable, most considerably underestimated Bitcoin's electricity consumption. 2) Participants with a more accurate understanding of Bitcoin's energy demand were more inclined to support sustainability measures. 3) Most of this supportive cohort viewed private entities as the primary stakeholders for implementing such measures. Given these findings, we suggest that consumer education should be at the forefront of policy initiatives aimed at cryptocurrency sustainability. |

|**2024-04-06**|**Partial Selfish Mining for More Profits**|Jiaping Yu et.al.|[2207.13478](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13478)| Mining attacks aim to gain an unfair share of extra rewards in the blockchain mining. Selfish mining can preserve discovered blocks and strategically release them, wasting honest miners' computing resources and getting higher profits. Previous mining attacks either conceal the mined whole blocks (hiding or discarding), or release them completely in a particular time slot (e.g., causing a fork). In this paper, we extend the mining attack's strategy space to partial block sharing, and propose a new and feasible Partial Selfish Mining (PSM) attack. We show that by releasing partial block data publicly and attracting rational miners to work on attacker's private branch, attackers and these attracted miners can gain an unfair share of mining rewards. We then propose Advanced PSM (A-PSM) attack that can further improve attackers' profits to be no less than the selfish mining. Both theoretical and experimental results show that PSM attackers can be more profitable than selfish miners under a certain range of mining power and network conditions. A-PSM attackers can gain even higher profits than both selfish mining and honest mining with attracted rational miners. |

Unlike normal loans, flash loans allow borrowers to borrow large assets without upfront collaterals deposits. Malicious adversaries use flash loans to gather large assets to exploit vulnerable DeFi protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for automated synthesis of adversarial transactions that exploit DeFi protocols using flash loans. To bypass the complexity of a DeFi protocol, we propose a new technique to approximate the DeFi protocol functional behaviors using numerical methods (polynomial linear regression and nearest-neighbor interpolation). We then construct an optimization query using the approximated functions of the DeFi protocol to find an adversarial attack constituted of a sequence of functions invocations with optimal parameters that gives the maximum profit. To improve the accuracy of the approximation, we propose a novel counterexample driven approximation refinement technique. We implement our framework in a tool named FlashSyn. We evaluate FlashSyn on 16 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash loan attacks and 2 DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges. FlashSyn automatically synthesizes an adversarial attack for 16 of the 18 benchmarks. Among the 16 successful cases, FlashSyn identifies attack vectors yielding higher profits than those employed by historical hackers in 3 cases, and also discovers multiple distinct attack vectors in 10 cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding possible flash loan attacks. |

Classical Byzantine agreements unavoidably face two major problems. One is $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, which means that the system to tolerate $f$ malicious players requires at least $3f+1$ players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical cryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with unconditional security to break this bound with nearly $1/2$ fault tolerance due to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures. \textcolor{black}{It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary to break the $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation, such as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work.} Our work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any number of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We experimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital ledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems and suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus networks. |

We study the ecosystem of the tokens and liquidity pools, highlighting analogies and differences between the two blockchains. We estimate the lifetime of the tokens, discovering that about 60% of them are active for less than one day. Moreover, we find that 1% of addresses create an anomalous number of tokens (between 20% and 25%). We present an exit scam fraud and quantify its prevalence on both blockchains. We find that token spammers use short lifetime tokens as disposable tokens to perpetrate these frauds serially. Finally, we present a new kind of trader bot involved in these activities, and we detect their presence and quantify their activity in the exit scam operations. |

However, in these systems, third parties are still involved in selling surplus energy. This results in increased cost of energy and there are many operational and security barriers in such systems. These issues can be solved by the decentralized distributed system of microgrids where a consumer can locally sell their surplus energy to another consumer. To deploy such a system, one must consider security barriers for the transaction of energy. This paper proposes a solution to these problems by devising a scheme as a marketplace where users interact with each other to buy and sell energy at better rates and get energy-generating resources on lease so that users do not have to worry about capital investment. Agreement between owner of resources and consumer is recorded on blockchain based smart contracts. In this paper, a survey is performed for existing well known, decentralized energy solutions. This paper also proposes an extra layer of security to leverage a shielded execution environment so that information of energy generated, utilized, and shared cannot be changed by consumers and third parties even if the system is compromised. |

Traditional FL heavily relies on a trusted centralized server. Although decentralized FL eliminates the central dependence, it may worsen the other inherit problems faced by FL such as poisoning attacks and data representation leakage due to insufficient restrictions on the behavior of participants, and heavy communication cost, especially in fully decentralized scenarios, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) settings. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fully decentralized P2P framework for FL, called BlockDFL. It takes blockchain as the foundation, leveraging the proposed PBFT-based voting mechanism and two-layer scoring mechanism to coordinate FL among peer participants without mutual trust, while effectively defending against poisoning attacks. Gradient compression is introduced to lowering communication cost and prevent data from being reconstructed from transmitted model updates. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets exhibit that BlockDFL obtains competitive accuracy compared to centralized FL and can defend poisoning attacks while achieving efficiency and scalability. Especially when the proportion of malicious participants is as high as 40%, BlockDFL can still preserve the accuracy of FL, outperforming existing fully decentralized P2P FL frameworks based on blockchain. |

They improve the latency of state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols by almost 2X and achieve optimal good-case complexity of O(n) by forgoing Reliable Broadcast as a building block.   Rather, Cordial Miners use the blocklace -- a partially-ordered counterpart of the totally-ordered blockchain data structure -- to implement the three algorithmic components of consensus: Dissemination, equivocation-exclusion, and ordering. |

This paper proposes a bodyless block propagation (BBP) scheme for which the blockbody is not validated and transmitted during block propagation, to increase TPS without compromising security. Nodes in the blockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next upcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated before the block is born. For a network with $N$ nodes, our theoretical analysis reveals that BBP can improve TPS scalability from $O(1/log(N))$ to $O(1)$ .   Ensuring consensus on the next block's transaction content is crucial. We propose a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization algorithm to drive this consensus. To address the undetermined Coinbase address issue, we further present an algorithm for such unresolvable transactions, ensuring a consistent and TPS-efficient scheme. With BBP, most transactions require neither validation nor transmission during block propagation, liberating system from transaction-block dependencies and rendering TPS scalable. Both theoretical analysis and experiments underscore BBP's potential for full TPS scalability. Experimental results reveal a 4x reduction in block propagation time compared to Ethereum blockchain, with TPS performance being limited by node hardware rather than block propagation. |

Recently, numerous new BFT algorithms have been proposed, not least due to the traction blockchain technologies have garnered in the search for consensus solutions that offer high throughput, low latency, and robust system designs. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of selected and distinguished BFT algorithms that have received extensive attention in academia and industry alike. We perform a qualitative comparison among all algorithms we review considering message and time complexities. Furthermore, we decompose each consensus algorithm into its constituent subprotocols for replication and view change backed by intuitive figures to illustrate the message-passing pattern. We also elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. |
|**2024-05-04**|**Light Clients for Lazy Blockchains**|Ertem Nusret Tas et.al.|[2203.15968](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15968)| Lazy blockchains decouple consensus from transaction verification and execution to increase throughput. Although they can contain invalid transactions (e.g., double spends) as a result, these can easily be filtered out by full nodes that check if there have been previous conflicting transactions. However, creating light (SPV) clients that do not see the whole transaction history becomes a challenge: A record of a transaction on the chain does not necessarily entail transaction confirmation. In this paper, we devise a protocol that enables the creation of efficient light clients for lazy blockchains. The number of interaction rounds and the communication complexity of our protocol are logarithmic in the blockchain execution time. Our construction is based on a bisection game that traverses the Merkle tree containing the ledger of all - valid or invalid - transactions. We prove that our proof system is succinct, complete and sound, and empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme. |

Specifically, we first design and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., to generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and to implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, learn the knowledge from data using the Deep Belief Network, and then share the knowledge learned from its data with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid the risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as excessive network overhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments clearly show that our proposed intrusion detection framework can achieve an accuracy of up to 98.6% in detecting attacks. |

This paper describes technical foundations, current applications, and some novel applications of zk-SNARKs. Regarding technical foundations, we go over the Quadratic Arithmetic Program reduction and the Pinocchio protocol. We then go over financial security applications like Zcash and Tornado Cash, and zk-Rollup applications like zkEVM and Darkforest. We propose novel zk-SNARK protocols for private auctions and decentralized card games on the blockchain, providing code for the proposed applications. We conclude by touching on promising zk-SNARK innovations, such as zk-STARKs. |
|**2023-12-04**|**More is Merrier: Relax the Non-Collusion Assumption in Multi-Server PIR**|Tiantian Gong et.al.|[2201.07740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07740)| A long line of research on secure computation has confirmed that anything that can be computed, can be computed securely using a set of non-colluding parties. Indeed, this non-collusion assumption makes a number of problems solvable, as well as reduces overheads and bypasses computational hardness results, and it is pervasive across different privacy-enhancing technologies. However, it remains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among computing parties. This work stems from an observation that if the number of available computing parties is much higher than the number of parties required to perform a secure computation task, collusion attempts in privacy-preserving computations could be deterred.   We focus on the prominent privacy-preserving computation task of multi-server $1$ -private information retrieval (PIR) that inherently assumes no pair-wise collusion. For PIR application scenarios, such as those for blockchain light clients, where the available servers can be plentiful, a single server's deviating action is not tremendously beneficial to itself. We can make deviations undesired via small amounts of rewards and penalties, thus significantly raising the bar for collusion resistance. We design and implement a collusion mitigation mechanism on a public bulletin board with payment execution functions, considering only rational and malicious parties with no honest non-colluding servers. Privacy protection is offered for an extended period after the query executions. |
|**2023-12-24**|**Two Sequential Squaring Verifiable Delay Function**|Souvik Sur et.al.|[2112.05997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05997)| A Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a function that takes a specified sequential time to be evaluated, but can be efficiently verified. VDFs are useful in several applications ranging from randomness beacons to sustainable blockchains but are really rare in practice. Most of the VDFs are based on algebraic assumptions like time-lock puzzle in unknown group orders [6, 8] and isogenies over pairing groups [4]. The number of modulo squaring required for verification in the time-lock puzzle based VDFs are proportional to their security parameter. This paper proposes a verifiable delay function that requires only 2- modulo squaring for verification. So the sequential effort required for verification is independent of the security parameter. |
|**2024-06-01**|**A Systematic Survey of Blockchained Federated Learning**|Zhilin Wang et.al.|[2110.02182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02182)| With the technological advances in machine learning, effective ways are available to process the huge amount of data generated in real life. However, issues of privacy and scalability will constrain the development of machine learning. Federated learning (FL) can prevent privacy leakage by assigning training tasks to multiple clients, thus separating the central server from the local devices. However, FL still suffers from shortcomings such as single-point-failure and malicious data. The emergence of blockchain provides a secure and efficient solution for the deployment of FL. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature on blockchained FL (BCFL). First, we investigate how blockchain can be applied to federal learning from the perspective of system composition. Then, we analyze the concrete functions of BCFL from the perspective of mechanism design and illustrate what problems blockchain addresses specifically for FL. We also survey the applications of BCFL in reality. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future research directions. |

As a consequence, providing a clear unambiguous description of any activities carried out on blockchains has become crucial, and we feel the urgency to achieve that description at least for trading. This paper reports on how to leverage the \emph{Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services} ("\ONT{}") as a general means for the semantic representation of smart contracts stored on blockchain as software agents. Special attention is paid to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), whose management through the ERC721 standard is presented as a case study. |

This results in limitations on governance since elected candidates or policies are difficult to remove before the next elections, if needed, and allowed by the corresponding law. Participants may decide (through a public deliberation) to change their choices but have no opportunity to vote for these choices before the next elections. Another issue is the peak-end effect, where the judgment of voters is based on how they felt a short time before the elections. To address these issues, we propose Always on Voting (AoV) -- a repetitive voting framework that allows participants to vote and change elected candidates or policies without waiting for the next elections. Participants are permitted to privately change their vote at any point in time, while the effect of their change is manifested at the end of each epoch, whose duration is shorter than the time between two main elections. To thwart the problem of peak-end effect in epochs, the ends of epochs are randomized and made unpredictable, while preserved within soft bounds. These goals are achieved using the synergy between a Bitcoin puzzle oracle, verifiable delay function, and smart contracts. |

|**2023-12-22**|**Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Tim Roughgarden et.al.|[2106.01340](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01340)| Demand for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is far larger than supply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to include "on-chain" from the pool of all pending transactions. This paper investigates the problem of designing a blockchain transaction fee mechanism through the lens of mechanism design. We introduce two new forms of incentive-compatibility that capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting, one (MMIC) that protects against deviations by profit-maximizing miners and one (OCA-proofness) that protects against off-chain collusion between miners and users.   This study is immediately applicable to a recent (August 5, 2021) and major change to Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism, based on a proposal called "EIP-1559." Historically, Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism was a first-price (pay-as-bid) auction. EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly coupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a history-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of the transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive report card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden demand spike. We also introduce an alternative design, the "tipless mechanism," which offers an incomparable slate of incentive-compatibility guarantees -- it is MMIC and DSIC, and OCA-proof unless in the midst of a demand spike. |
|**2024-01-31**|**Secure and Efficient Federated Learning Through Layering and Sharding Blockchain**|Shuo Yuan et.al.|[2104.13130](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13130)| Introducing blockchain into Federated Learning (FL) to build a trusted edge computing environment for transmission and learning has attracted widespread attention as a new decentralized learning pattern. However, traditional consensus mechanisms and architectures of blockchain systems face significant challenges in handling large-scale FL tasks, especially on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, due to their substantial resource consumption, limited transaction throughput, and complex communication requirements. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ChainFL, a novel two-layer blockchain-driven FL system. It splits the IoT network into multiple shards within the subchain layer, effectively reducing the scale of information exchange, and employs a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based mainchain as the mainchain layer, enabling parallel and asynchronous cross-shard validation. Furthermore, the FL procedure is customized to integrate deeply with blockchain technology, and a modified DAG consensus mechanism is designed to mitigate distortion caused by abnormal models. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation, multiple subchains based on Hyperledger Fabric and a self-developed DAG-based mainchain are deployed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChainFL significantly surpasses conventional FL systems, showing up to a 14% improvement in training efficiency and a threefold increase in robustness. |

In this paper, we begin with an overview of the different types and architectures of blockchain networks. Then, with a focus on consortium blockchains, we survey, classify, and assess their principal consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, as consensus mechanisms determine network reliability, enhance performance efficiency, and ensure system security, we conduct a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of consensus algorithms using a taxonomy of three different criteria: reliability, performance, and security. We conclude with insights into current and future research challenges and opportunities in this domain. |

OSCs are ontological representations of smart contracts that allow to establish responsibilities and authorizations among agents and set agreements, whereas conditionals allow one to restrict and limit agent interactions, define activation mechanisms that trigger agent actions, and define constraints and contract terms on OSCs. Conditionals and OSCs, as defined in OASIS, are applied to extend with ontological capabilities digital public ledgers such as the blockchain and smart contracts implemented on it. We will also sketch the architecture of a framework based on the OASIS definition of OSCs that exploits the Ethereum platform and the Interplanetary File System. |

However, routing transactions comes at a cost which is proportional to the number of intermediaries, since each charges a fee for the routing service. Furthermore, analogous to other networks, malicious intermediaries in the payment path can lead to security and privacy threats. Virtual channels (VCs), i.e., bridges over PC paths, mitigate the above PCN issues, as an intermediary participates only once to set up the VC and is then excluded from every future VC transaction. However, similar to PCs, creating a VC has a cost that must be paid out of the bridged PCs' balance. Currently, we are missing guidelines to where and how many VCs to set up. Ideally, VCs should minimize transaction costs while mitigating security and privacy threats from on-path adversaries.   In this work, we address for the first time the VC setup problem, formalizing it as an optimization problem. We present an integer linear program (ILP) to compute the globally optimal VC setup strategy in terms of transaction costs, security, and privacy. We then accompany the computationally heavy ILP with a fast local greedy algorithm. Our model and algorithms can be used with any on-path adversary, given that its strategy can be expressed as a set of corrupted nodes that is estimated by the honest nodes. We conduct an evaluation of the greedy algorithm over a snapshot of the Lightning Network (LN), the largest Bitcoin-based PCN. Our results confirm on real-world data that our greedy strategy minimizes costs while protecting against security and privacy threats of on-path adversaries. These findings may serve the LN community as guidelines for the deployment of VCs. |

Sami Ullah et.al.|[2004.06795](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06795)| Blockchain technology is one of the most contemporary and disruptive technologies in the world. It has gained considerable attention in numerous applications such as financial services, cybersecurity applications, Internet of Things (IoT), network data management. Now its range of applications is beyond the financial services as the healthcare industry has also adopted blockchain technology in its various subdomains such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical supply chain management system, genomic market, neuroscience technology, clinical research, and pharmaceutical medicine. Blockchain is considered a secure and viable solution for storing and accessing patients medical records and the patients can diagnosed and treated with safe and secure data sharing. Blockchain technology will revolutionize the healthcare systems with personalized, authentic, and secure access to the clinical data of patients and that data can be used for further health improvements and clinical researches. In this paper, we conduct a contemporary research on existing applications and developments in healthcare industry with the use of blockchain technology. We also discuss some robust applications and various existing companies that are using blockchain solutions for securing their data along with some current challenges and future perspectives. |

Sami Ullah et.al.|[2002.05650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05650)| The Smart Grid (SG) concept presented an unprecedented opportunity to move the energy sector to more availability, reliability, and efficiency to improve our economic and environmental conditions. Renewable energy sources (Solar & Wind) are such technologies that are used in the smart grid to figure out the environmental and economic issues and challenges. Smart grids provide energy in different crowded sectors with the efficient and timely transmission of electricity. But the traditional power grids follow a centralized approach for energy transactions with a large number of growing connections and become more challenging to handle power disturbance in the grid. Blockchain as a decentralized and distributed technology provides promising applications in the smart grid infrastructure with its excellent and salient features. In this paper, we provide a concise review of blockchain architecture, concepts, and applications in smart grids. Different potential opportunities for blockchain technology with smart grids are also discussed. Some future directions concluded the paper. |

The goal in this paper is to solve the test oracle problem in a way that is general, scalable and accurate. To achieve this, we use supervised learning over test execution traces. We label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdict of pass or fail. We use the labelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn to distinguish runtime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a given program. Our approach for building this NN model involves the following steps, 1. Instrument the program to record execution traces as sequences of method invocations and global state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information in execution traces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the trace information for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification model on unseen execution traces from the program.   We evaluate our approach using case studies from different application domains: 1. Module from Ethereum Blockchain, 2. Module from PyTorch deep learning framework, 3. Microsoft SEAL encryption library components, 4. Sed stream editor, 5. Value pointer library and 6. Nine network protocols from Linux packet identifier, L7-Filter. We found the classification models for all subject programs resulted in high precision, recall and specificity, over 95%, while only training with an average 9% of the total traces. Our experiments show that the proposed neural network model is highly effective as a test oracle and is able to learn runtime patterns to distinguish passing and failing test executions for systems and tests from different application domains. |

With the increased amount of data duplication & accidental deletion of files on the Internet, the P2P file system called IPFS completely changes the way files are stored. IPFS is a file storage protocol allowing files to be stored on decentralized systems. In the HTTP client-server protocol, files are downloaded from a single source. With files stored on a decentralized network, IPFS allows packet retrieval from multiple sources, simultaneously saving considerable bandwidth. IPFS uses a content-addressed block storage model with content-addressed hyperlinks. Large amounts of data is addressable with IPFS with the immutable and permanent IPFS links with meta-data stored as Blockchain transactions. This timestamps and secures the data, instead of having to put it on the chain itself. Our paper proposes a model that uses the decentralized file storage system of IPFS, and the integrity preservation properties of the Blockchain, to store and distribute data on the Web. |

Due to its rapid and widespread diffusion, digital deception has not only an individual or societal cost (e.g., to hamper the integrity of elections), but it can lead to significant economic losses (e.g., to affect stock market performance) or to risks to national security. Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance, authenticity and traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure platform for storing and exchanging information. This overview aims to explore the potential of DLTs and blockchain to combat digital deception, reviewing initiatives that are currently under development and identifying their main current challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to face fake news, disinformation and deepfakes, as an integral part of strengthening the resilience against cyber-threats on today's online media. |
|**2024-02-01**|**A Review on the Application of Blockchain for the Next Generation of Cybersecure Industry 4.0 Smart Factories**|Tiago M. Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[1902.09604](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09604)| Industry 4.0 is a concept devised for improving the way modern factories operate through the use of some of the latest technologies, like the ones used for creating Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), robotics or Big Data applications. One of such technologies is blockchain, which is able to add trust, security and decentralization to different industrial fields. This article focuses on analyzing the benefits and challenges that arise when using blockchain and smart contracts to develop Industry 4.0 applications. In addition, this paper presents a thorough review on the most relevant blockchain-based applications for Industry 4.0 technologies. Thus, its aim is to provide a detailed guide for future Industry 4.0 developers that allows for determining how blockchain can enhance the next generation of cybersecure industrial applications. |

We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules.   In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures. |

This settlement latency slows cross-exchange trading, exposing arbitrageurs to price risk. Off-chain settlement, instead, exposes arbitrageurs to costly default risk. We show with Bitcoin network and order book data that cross-exchange price differences coincide with periods of high settlement latency, asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities, and price differences across exchanges with low default risk are smaller. Blockchain-based trading thus faces a dilemma: Reliable consensus protocols require time-consuming settlement latency, leading to arbitrage limits. Circumventing such arbitrage costs is possible only by reinstalling trusted intermediation, which mitigates default risk. |

For example, e-crime investigations of illegal Tor hidden services, such as Silk Road, often involve linking Bitcoin addresses, from which money is sent or received, to user accounts and related online activities. We present BlockTag, an open-source tagging system for blockchains that facilitates such tasks. We describe BlockTag's design and present three analyses that illustrate its capabilities in the context of privacy research and law enforcement. |
