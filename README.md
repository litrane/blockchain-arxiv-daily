|**2024-12-09**|**ICtoken: An NFT for Hardware IP Protection**|Shashank Balla et.al.|[2412.06726](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06726)| Protecting integrated circuits (ICs) from piracy and theft throughout their lifecycle is a persistent and complex challenge. In order to safeguard against illicit piracy attacks, this work proposes a novel framework utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) called ICtokens, uniquely linked to their corresponding physical ICs. Each ICtoken contains comprehensive information, including authentication data, supply chain stage and status, ownership details, and other IC metadata, while also making provision for the secure integration of a logic-locking key. Designed to be publicly logged, ICtokens securely obscure metering information without compromising functionality. In addition, the ICtracker, a distributed ledger technology powered by a swift and energy-efficient consortium blockchain, is used to register and manage ICtokens and their respective owners, tracking all associated interactions. This robust ledger guarantees the traceability and auditing of ICtokens while simultaneously developing a product-level NFT at every transaction point within the supply chain. Consequently, a scalable framework is established, creating unique, immutable digital twins for ICs and IC-embedded products in the form of ICtokens and their transactions. This provides a robust and reliable supply chain trail back to the original IP owner, while also offering unprecedented assurance to consumers of IC-embedded products. The rich information contained within ICtokens facilitates more detailed audits than previous proposals for IC supply chain monitoring. A proof-of-concept, implemented as an open-source solution, ensures the ease of adoption of the proposed framework. |

The emergence of quantum blockchain holds promise for addressing this issue. Various quantum consensus algorithms have been proposed so far, but there has not yet been a quantum consensus algorithm tailored specifically for consortium blockchain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum consensus mechanism, named Q-PnV. This consensus mechanism is based on the classical Proof of Vote (PoV), integrating quantum voting, quantum digital signature and quantum random number generators (QRNGs). By combining Q-PnV with a quantum blockchain using weighted hypergraph states, we propose a comprehensive quantum blockchain solution for consortium blockchain scenarios. Compared to the classical method, the quantum blockchain based on Q-PnV can resist quantum attacks and shows significant improvements in security and fairness, making it better suit-ed for the future quantum era. |
|**2024-12-09**|**BECS: A Privacy-Preserving Computing Sharing Mechanism in 6G Computing Power Network**|Kun Yan et.al.|[2412.06196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06196)| 5G networks provide secure and reliable information transmission services for the Internet of Everything, thus paving the way for 6G networks, which is anticipated to be an AI-based network, supporting unprecedented intelligence across applications. Abundant computing resources will establish the 6G Computing Power Network (CPN) to facilitate ubiquitous intelligent services. In this article, we propose BECS, a computing sharing mechanism based on evolutionary algorithm and blockchain, designed to balance task offloading among user devices, edge devices, and cloud resources within 6G CPN, thereby enhancing the computing resource utilization. We model computing sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to improve resource utilization while balancing other issues. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we devise a kernel distance-based dominance relation and incorporated it into the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III, significantly enhancing the diversity of the evolutionary population. In addition, we propose a pseudonym scheme based on zero-knowledge proof to protect the privacy of users participating in computing sharing. Finally, the security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that BECS can fully and effectively utilize all computing resources in 6G CPN, significantly improving the computing resource utilization while protecting user privacy. |
|**2024-12-08**|**A Dynamic Tree Structure for Hierarchical On-Chain Asset Management**|Mojtaba Eshghie et.al.|[2412.06026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06026)| In this paper, we introduce the Sarv, a novel non-monolithic blockchain-based data structure designed to represent hierarchical relationships between digitally representable components. Sarv serves as an underlying infrastructure for a wide range of applications requiring hierarchical data management, such as supply chain tracking, asset management, and circular economy implementations. Our approach leverages a tree-based data structure to accurately reflect products and their sub-components, enabling functionalities such as modification, disassembly, borrowing, and refurbishment, mirroring real-world operations. The hierarchy within Sarv is embedded in the on-chain data structure through a smart contract-based design, utilizing Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). The uniqueness of Sarv lies in its compact and non-monolithic architecture, its mutability, and a two-layer action authorization scheme that enhances security and delegation of asset management. We demonstrate that Sarv addresses real-world requirements by providing a scalable, mutable, and secure solution for managing hierarchical data on the blockchain. |
|**2024-12-07**|**Balancing Confidentiality and Transparency for Blockchain-based Process-Aware Information Systems**|Alessandro Marcelletti et.al.|[2412.05737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05737)| Blockchain enables novel, trustworthy Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) by enforcing the security, robustness, and traceability of operations. In particular, transparency ensures that all information exchanges are openly accessible, fostering trust within the system. Although this is a desirable property to enable notarization and auditing activities, it also represents a limitation for such cases where confidentiality is a requirement since interactions involve sensible data. Current solutions rely on obfuscation techniques or private infrastructures, hindering the enforcing capabilities of smart contracts and the public verifiability of transactions. Against this background, we propose CONFETTY, an architecture for blockchain-based PAISs aimed at preserving both confidentiality and transparency. Smart contracts enact, enforce and store public interactions, while attribute-based encryption techniques are adopted to specify access grants to confidential information. We assess the security of our solution through a systematic threat model analysis and assess its practical feasibility by gauging the performance of our implemented prototype in different scenarios from the literature. |
|**2024-12-07**|**Dynamic Digital Twins of Blockchain Systems: State Extraction and Mirroring**|Georgios Diamantopoulos et.al.|[2412.05527](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05527)| Blockchain adoption is reaching an all-time high, with a plethora of blockchain architectures being developed to cover the needs of applications eager to integrate blockchain into their operations. However, blockchain systems suffer from the trilemma trade-off problem, which limits their ability to scale without sacrificing essential metrics such as decentralisation and security. The balance of the trilemma trade-off is primarily dictated by the consensus protocol used. Since consensus protocols are designed to function well under specific system conditions, and consequently, due to the blockchain's complex and dynamic nature, systems operating under a single consensus protocol are bound to face periods of inefficiency. The work presented in this paper constitutes part of an effort to design a Digital Twin-based blockchain management framework to balance the trilemma trade-off problem, which aims to adapt the consensus process to fit the conditions of the underlying system. Specifically, this work addresses the problems of extracting the blockchain system and mirroring it in its digital twin by proposing algorithms that overcome the challenges posed by blockchains' decentralised and asynchronous nature and the fundamental problems of global state and synchronisation in such systems. The robustness of the proposed algorithms is experimentally evaluated. |

This paper introduces EC-Chain, a cost-effective storage solution for permissionless blockchains. EC-Chain reduces storage overheads of ledger and state data, which comprise blockchain data. For ledger data, EC-Chain refines existing erasure coding-based storage optimization techniques by incorporating batch encoding and height-based encoding. We also introduce an easy-to-implement dual-trie state management system that enhances state storage and retrieval through state expiry, mining, and creation procedures. To ensure data availability in permissionless environments, EC-Chain introduces a network maintenance scheme tailored for dynamism. Collectively, these contributions allow EC-Chain to provide an effective solution to the storage challenges faced by permissionless blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates that EC-Chain can achieve a storage reduction of over \(90\%\) compared to native Ethereum Geth. |
|**2024-12-03**|**Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain**|Pierre-Olivier Goffard et.al.|[2412.05321](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321)| This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to both surplus providers and policyholders. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept. |
|**2024-12-06**|**An Experimental Framework for Implementing Decentralized Autonomous Database Systems in Rust**|Prakash Aryan et.al.|[2412.05078](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05078)| This paper presents an experimental framework for implementing Decentralized Autonomous Database Systems (DADBS) using the Rust programming language. As traditional centralized databases face challenges in scalability, security, and autonomy, DADBS emerge as a promising solution, using blockchain principles to create distributed, self-governing database systems. Our framework explores the practical aspects of building a DADBS, focusing on Rust's unique features that improves system reliability and performance. We evaluated our DADBS implementation across several key performance metrics: throughput, latency(read), latency(write), scalability, CPU utilization, Memory Usage and Network I/O, The average results obtained over a 24-hour period of continuous operation were 3,000 transactions/second, 75 ms, 250 ms, 55%, 2.5 GB, 100MB/s. The security analysis depicts that even with an increase in the percentage of malicious nodes, DADBS still maintains high throughput and consistency. The paper discusses key design decisions, highlighting how Rust's ownership model and concurrency features address common challenges in distributed systems. We also examine the current limitations of our approach and potential areas for future research. By providing this comprehensive overview of a Rust-based DADBS implementation, we aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on decentralized database architectures and their practical realization. |
|**2024-12-06**|**Bridging Culture and Finance: A Multimodal Analysis of Memecoins in the Web3 Ecosystem**|Hou-Wan Long et.al.|[2412.04913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04913)| Memecoins, driven by social media engagement and cultural narratives, have rapidly grown within the Web3 ecosystem. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, they are shaped by humor, memes, and community sentiment. This paper introduces the Coin-Meme dataset, an open-source collection of visual, textual, community, and financial data from the Pump.fun platform on the Solana blockchain. We also propose a multimodal framework to analyze memecoins, uncovering patterns in cultural themes, community interaction, and financial behavior. Through clustering, sentiment analysis, and word cloud visualizations, we identify distinct thematic groups centered on humor, animals, and political satire. Additionally, we provide financial insights by analyzing metrics such as Market Entry Time and Market Capitalization, offering a comprehensive view of memecoins as both cultural artifacts and financial instruments within Web3. The Coin-Meme dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/hwlongCUHK/Coin-Meme.git. |
|**2024-12-06**|**DRDST: Low-latency DAG Consensus through Robust Dynamic Sharding and Tree-broadcasting for IoV**|Runhua Chen et.al.|[2412.04742](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04742)| The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is emerging as a pivotal technology for enhancing traffic management and safety. Its rapid development demands solutions for enhanced communication efficiency and reduced latency. However, traditional centralized networks struggle to meet these demands, prompting the exploration of decentralized solutions such as blockchain. Addressing blockchain's scalability challenges posed by the growing number of nodes and transactions calls for innovative solutions, among which sharding stands out as a pivotal approach to significantly enhance blockchain throughput. However, existing schemes still face challenges related to a) the impact of vehicle mobility on blockchain consensus, especially for cross-shard transaction; and b) the strict requirements of low latency consensus in a highly dynamic network. In this paper, we propose a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) consensus leveraging Robust Dynamic Sharding and Tree-broadcasting (DRDST) to address these challenges. Specifically, we first develop a standard for evaluating the network stability of nodes, combined with the nodes' trust values, to propose a novel robust sharding model that is solved through the design of the Genetic Sharding Algorithm (GSA). Then, we optimize the broadcast latency of the whole sharded network by improving the tree-broadcasting to minimize the maximum broadcast latency within each shard. On this basis, we also design a DAG consensus scheme based on an improved hashgraph protocol, which can efficiently handle cross-shard transactions. Finally, the simulation proves the proposed scheme is superior to the comparison schemes in latency, throughput, consensus success rate, and node traffic load. |
|**2024-12-05**|**DistB-VNET: Distributed Cluster-based Blockchain Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks through SDN-NFV for Smart City**|Anichur Rahman et.al.|[2412.04222](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04222)| In the developing topic of smart cities, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are crucial for providing successful interaction between vehicles and infrastructure. This research proposes a distributed Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (DistB-VNET) architecture that includes binary malicious traffic classification, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to ensure safe, scalable, and reliable vehicular networks in smart cities. The suggested framework is the decentralized blockchain for safe data management and SDN-NFV for dynamic network management and resource efficiency and a noble isolation forest algorithm works as an IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Further, "DistB-VNET" offers a dual-layer blockchain system, where a distributed blockchain provides safe communication between vehicles, while a centralized blockchain in the cloud is in charge of data verification and storage. This improves security, scalability, and adaptability, ensuring better traffic management, data security, and privacy in VANETs. Furthermore, the unsupervised isolation forest model achieves a high accuracy of 99.23% for detecting malicious traffic. Additionally, reveals that our method greatly improves network performance, offering decreased latency, increased security, and reduced congestion, an effective alternative for existing smart city infrastructures. |
|**2024-12-05**|**WACANA: A Concolic Analyzer for Detecting On-chain Data Vulnerabilities in WASM Smart Contracts**|Wansen Wang et.al.|[2412.03946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03946)| WebAssembly (WASM) has emerged as a crucial technology in smart contract development for several blockchain platforms. Unfortunately, since their introduction, WASM smart contracts have been subject to several security incidents caused by contract vulnerabilities, resulting in substantial economic losses. However, existing tools for detecting WASM contract vulnerabilities have accuracy limitations, one of the main reasons being the coarse-grained emulation of the on-chain data APIs.   In this paper, we introduce WACANA, an analyzer for WASM contracts that accurately detects vulnerabilities through fine-grained emulation of on-chain data APIs. WACANA precisely simulates both the structure of on-chain data tables and their corresponding API functions, and integrates concrete and symbolic execution within a coverage-guided loop to balance accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations on a vulnerability dataset of 133 contracts show WACANA outperforming state-of-the-art tools in accuracy. Further validation on 5,602 real-world contracts confirms WACANA's practical effectiveness. |
|**2024-12-04**|**Securing RC Based P2P Networks: A Blockchain-based Access Control Framework utilizing Ethereum Smart Contracts for IoT and Web 3.0**|Saurav Ghosh et.al.|[2412.03709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03709)| Ensuring security for highly dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has always been a challenge, especially for services like online transactions and smart devices. These networks experience high churn rates, making it difficult to maintain appropriate access control. Traditional systems, particularly Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), often fail to meet the needs of a P2P environment. This paper presents a blockchain-based access control framework that uses Ethereum smart contracts to address these challenges. Our framework aims to close the gaps in existing access control systems by providing flexible, transparent, and decentralized security solutions. The proposed framework includes access control contracts (ACC) that manage access based on static and dynamic policies, a Judge Contract (JC) to handle misbehavior, and a Register Contract (RC) to record and manage the interactions between ACCs and JC. The security model combines impact and severity-based threat assessments using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and STRIDE principles, ensuring responses are tailored to different threat levels. This system not only stabilizes the fundamental issues of peer membership but also offers a scalable solution, particularly valuable in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 3.0 technologies. |
|**2024-12-03**|**Block MedCare: Advancing healthcare through blockchain integration with AI and IoT**|Oliver Simonoski et.al.|[2412.02851](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02851)| This research explores the integration of blockchain technology in healthcare, focusing on enhancing the security and efficiency of Electronic Health Record (EHR) management. We propose a novel Ethereum-based system that empowers patients with secure control over their medical data. Our approach addresses key challenges in healthcare blockchain implementation, including scalability, privacy, and regulatory compliance. The system incorporates digital signatures, Role-Based Access Control, and a multi-layered architecture to ensure secure, controlled access. We developed a decentralized application (dApp) with user-friendly interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators, demonstrating the practical application of our solution. A survey among healthcare professionals and IT experts revealed strong interest in blockchain adoption, while also highlighting concerns about integration costs. The study explores future enhancements, including integration with IoT devices and AI-driven analytics, contributing to the evolution of secure, efficient, and interoperable healthcare systems that leverage cutting-edge technologies for improved patient care. |
|**2024-12-03**|**Liquefaction: Privately Liquefying Blockchain Assets**|James Austgen et.al.|[2412.02634](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02634)| Inherent in the world of cryptocurrency systems and their security models is the notion that private keys, and thus assets, are controlled by individuals or individual entities.   We present Liquefaction, a wallet platform that demonstrates the dangerous fragility of this foundational assumption by systemically breaking it. Liquefaction uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) to encumber private keys, i.e., attach rich, multi-user policies to their use. In this way, it enables the cryptocurrency credentials and assets of a single end-user address to be freely rented, shared, or pooled. It accomplishes these things privately, with no direct on-chain traces.   Liquefaction demonstrates the sweeping consequences of TEE-based key encumbrance for the cryptocurrency landscape. Liquefaction can undermine the security and economic models of many applications and resources, such as locked tokens, DAO voting, airdrops, loyalty points, soulbound tokens, and quadratic voting. It can do so with no on-chain and minimal off-chain visibility. Conversely, we also discuss beneficial applications of Liquefaction, such as privacy-preserving, cost-efficient DAOs and a countermeasure to dusting attacks. Importantly, we describe an existing TEE-based tool that applications can use as a countermeasure to Liquefaction.   Our work prompts a wholesale rethinking of existing models and enforcement of key and asset ownership in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. |
|**2024-12-03**|**Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions**|Shabnam Fazliani et.al.|[2412.02408](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408)| The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. However, this growth has also introduced significant security risks, including the proliferation of illicit accounts involved in fraudulent activities. Traditional detection methods are limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Learning Ensemble-based Illicit account Detection (SLEID) framework to address these challenges. SLEID employs an Isolation Forest for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms traditional supervised approaches and recent semi-supervised models, achieving superior precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly in detecting illicit accounts. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves better detection performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. The results affirm SLEID's efficacy as a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem and mitigating risks posed by malicious accounts. |
|**2024-12-06**|**Connecting Large Language Models with Blockchain: Advancing the Evolution of Smart Contracts from Automation to Intelligence**|Youquan Xian et.al.|[2412.02263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02263)| Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future. |
|**2024-12-03**|**Blockchain-Enabled Device-Enhanced Multi-Access Edge Computing in Open Adversarial Environments**|Muhammad Islam et.al.|[2412.02233](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02233)| We propose Blockchain-enabled Device-enhanced Multi-access Edge Computing (BdMEC). BdMEC extends the Honeybee framework for on-demand resource pooling with blockchain technology to ensure trust, security, and accountability among devices (even when they are owned by different parties). BdMEC mitigates risks from malicious devices by making computations traceable. Our prototype and results demonstrate BdMEC's ability to manage distributed computing tasks efficiently and securely across multiple devices. |
|**2024-12-02**|**AVA: Fault-tolerant Reconfigurable Geo-Replication on Heterogeneous Clusters**|Tejas Mane et.al.|[2412.01999](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01999)| Fault-tolerant replicated database systems consume less energy than the compute-intensive proof-of-work blockchain. Thus, they are promising technologies for the building blocks that assemble global financial infrastructure. To facilitate global scaling, clustered replication protocols are essential in orchestrating nodes into clusters based on proximity. However, the existing approaches often assume a homogeneous and fixed model in which the number of nodes across clusters is the same and fixed, and often limited to a fail-stop fault model. This paper presents heterogeneous and reconfigurable clustered replication for the general environment with arbitrary failures. In particular, we present AVA, a fault-tolerant reconfigurable geo-replication that allows dynamic membership: replicas are allowed to join and leave clusters. We formally state and prove the safety and liveness properties of the protocol. Furthermore, our replication protocol is consensus-agnostic, meaning each cluster can utilize any local replication mechanism. In our comprehensive evaluation, we instantiate our replication with both HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt. Experiments on geo-distributed deployments on Google Cloud demonstrates that members of clusters can be reconfigured without considerably affecting transaction processing, and that heterogeneity of clusters may significantly improve throughput. |

|**2024-12-02**|**Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, Tools, and Benchmarks: An Updated Systematic Literature Review**|Gerardo Iuliano et.al.|[2412.01719](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01719)| Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which have revolutionized decentralized finance by enabling trustless transactions and the operation of decentralized applications. Despite their potential, the security of smart contracts remains a critical concern due to their immutability and transparency, which expose them to malicious actors. The connections of contracts further complicate vulnerability detection. This paper presents a systematic literature review that explores vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on automated detection tools and benchmark evaluation. We reviewed 1,888 studies from five digital libraries and five major software engineering conferences, applying a structured selection process that resulted in 131 high-quality studies. The key results include a hierarchical taxonomy of 101 vulnerabilities grouped into ten categories, a comprehensive list of 144 detection tools with corresponding functionalities, methods, and code transformation techniques, and a collection of 102 benchmarks used for tool evaluation. We conclude with insights on the current state of Ethereum smart contract security and directions for future research. |
|**2024-12-02**|**The Future of Document Verification: Leveraging Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity for Enhanced Security and Transparency**|Swapna Krishnakumar Radha et.al.|[2412.01531](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01531)| Attestation of documents like legal papers, professional qualifications, medical records, and commercial documents is crucial in global transactions, ensuring their authenticity, integrity, and trustworthiness. Companies expanding operations internationally need to submit attested financial statements and incorporation documents to foreign governments or business partners to prove their businesses and operations' authenticity, legal validity, and regulatory compliance. Attestation also plays a critical role in education, overseas employment, and authentication of legal documents such as testaments and medical records. The traditional attestation process is plagued by several challenges, including time-consuming procedures, the circulation of counterfeit documents, and concerns over data privacy in the attested records. The COVID-19 pandemic brought into light another challenge: ensuring physical presence for attestation, which caused a significant delay in the attestation process. Traditional methods also lack real-time tracking capabilities for attesting entities and requesters. This paper aims to propose a new strategy using decentralized technologies such as blockchain and self-sovereign identity to overcome the identified hurdles and provide an efficient, secure, and user-friendly attestation ecosystem. |
|**2024-12-02**|**A Hybrid BPMN-DMN Framework for Secure Inter-organizational Processes and Decisions Collaboration on Permissioned Blockchain**|Xinzhe Shen et.al.|[2412.01196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01196)| In the rapidly evolving digital business landscape, organizations increasingly need to collaborate across boundaries to achieve complex business objectives, requiring both efficient process coordination and flexible decision-making capabilities. Traditional collaboration approaches face significant challenges in transparency, trust, and decision flexibility, while existing blockchain-based solutions primarily focus on process execution without addressing the integrated decision-making needs of collaborative enterprises. This paper proposes BlockCollab, a novel model-driven framework that seamlessly integrates Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) with Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to standardize and implement collaborative business processes and decisions on permissioned blockchain platforms. Our approach automatically translates integrated BPMN-DMN models into smart contracts(SCs) compatible with Hyperledger Fabric, enabling privacy-aware multi-organizational process execution through blockchain-based Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a standardized method for modeling collaborative processes and decisions using integrated BPMN-DMN model, (2) an automated SC generator that preserves both process logic and decision rules while maintaining privacy constraints, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain execution environment that optimizes collaborative workflows through secure data transfer and external system integration. Experimental evaluation across 11 real-world collaboration scenarios demonstrates that our approach achieves 100\% accuracy in process execution. Furthermore, an analysis of various execution processes highlights the strong practical applicability and reliability of our approach. The proposed framework includes an open-source third-party collaboration platform based on blockchain. |
|**2024-12-01**|**Post-Vaccination COVID-19 Data Analysis: Privacy and Ethics**|Sankha Das et.al.|[2412.00774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00774)| The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the world in terms of health, economy and peace. Fortunately, the countries are trying to overcome the situation by actively carrying out vaccinations. However, like any other massive operation involving humans such as human resource management, elections, surveys, etc., the vaccination process raises several questions about citizen privacy and misuse of personal data. In most of the countries, few attempts have been made to verify the vaccination statistics as reported by the health centers. These issues collectively require the solutions of anonymity of citizens' personal information, immutability of vaccination data and easy yet restricted access by adversarial bodies such as the government for the verification and analysis of the data. This paper introduces a blockchain-based application to simulate and monitor the vaccination process. The structure of data model used in the proposed system is based on the IEEE Standard for Data Format for Blockchain Systems 2418.2TM-2020. The proposed system enables authorized stakeholders to share and access relevant information for vaccination process chain while preserving citizen privacy and accountability of the system. It is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a Python API for the simulation and validation of each step of the vaccination process. |
|**2024-12-01**|**The Forking Way: When TEEs Meet Consensus**|Annika Wilde et.al.|[2412.00706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00706)| An increasing number of distributed platforms combine Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchains. Indeed, many hail the combination of TEEs and blockchains a good "marriage": TEEs bring confidential computing to the blockchain while the consensus layer could help defend TEEs from forking attacks.   In this paper, we systemize how current blockchain solutions integrate TEEs and to what extent they are secure against forking attacks. To do so, we thoroughly analyze 29 proposals for TEE-based blockchains, ranging from academic proposals to production-ready platforms. We uncover a lack of consensus in the community on how to combine TEEs and blockchains. In particular, we identify four broad means to interconnect TEEs with consensus, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible remedies. Our analysis also reveals previously undocumented forking attacks on three production-ready TEE-based blockchains: Ten, Phala, and the Secret Network. We leverage our analysis to propose effective countermeasures against those vulnerabilities; we responsibly disclosed our findings to the developers of each affected platform. |

Static mining pools exacerbate these issues by reducing competition and undermining the decentralized nature of blockchain networks, leading to economic inequality and inefficiencies in resource allocation. Their reliance on centralized pool managers further introduces vulnerabilities by creating a system that fails to ensure secure and fair reward distribution. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Proof-of-Work (CPoW) mining approach designed to enhance efficiency and fairness in the Ethereum network. We propose a dynamic mining pool formation protocol that enables miners to collaborate based on their computational capabilities, ensuring fair and secure reward distribution by incorporating mechanisms to accurately verify and allocate rewards. By addressing the centralization and energy inefficiencies of traditional mining, this research contributes to a more sustainable blockchain ecosystem. |

To address this issue, we propose SEAM, a novel framework that automates the conversion of standard Solidity contracts into upgradable versions using the diamond pattern. SEAM simplifies the upgrade process and addresses two key vulnerabilities: function selector clashes and storage slot collisions. Additionally, the framework provides tools for efficiently deploying, modifying, and managing smart contract lifecycles. By enhancing contract security and reducing the learning curve for developers, SEAM lays a robust foundation for more flexible and maintainable blockchain applications. |

This paper addresses the challenge of integrating decentralized authentication and access control within distributed networks. We propose a novel solution named ChainGuard, a fully decentralized authentication and access control mechanism based on smart contracts. ChainGuard eliminates the need for a central server by leveraging blockchain technology to manage user roles and permissions dynamically. Our scheme supports user interactions across multiple organizations simultaneously, enhancing security, efficiency, and transparency. By addressing key challenges such as scalability, security, and transparency, ChainGuard not only bridges the gap between traditional centralized systems and blockchain's decentralized ethos but also enhances data protection and operational efficiency. |

This paper introduces SmartLLMSentry, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT with in-context training, to advance smart contract vulnerability detection. Traditional rule-based frameworks have limitations in integrating new detection rules efficiently. In contrast, SmartLLMSentry utilizes LLMs to streamline this process. We created a specialized dataset of five randomly selected vulnerabilities for model training and evaluation. Our results show an exact match accuracy of 91.1% with sufficient data, although GPT-4 demonstrated reduced performance compared to GPT-3 in rule generation. This study illustrates that SmartLLMSentry significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of vulnerability detection through LLMdriven rule integration, offering a new approach to improving Blockchain security and addressing previously underexplored vulnerabilities in smart contracts. |
|**2024-11-28**|**A Game-Theoretic Approach to the Study of Blockchain's Robustness**|Ulysse Pavloff et.al.|[2411.19175](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19175)| Blockchains have sparked global interest in recent years, gaining importance as they increasingly influence technology and finance. This thesis investigates the robustness of blockchain protocols, specifically focusing on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake. We define robustness in terms of two critical properties: Safety, which ensures that the blockchain will not have permanent conflicting blocks, and Liveness, which guarantees the continuous addition of new reliable blocks.   Our research addresses the gap between traditional distributed systems approaches, which classify agents as either honest or Byzantine (i.e., malicious or faulty), and game-theoretic models that consider rational agents driven by incentives. We explore how incentives impact the robustness with both approaches.   The thesis comprises three distinct analyses. First, we formalize the Ethereum PoS protocol, defining its properties and examining potential vulnerabilities through a distributed systems perspective. We identify that certain attacks can undermine the system's robustness. Second, we analyze the inactivity leak mechanism, a critical feature of Ethereum PoS, highlighting its role in maintaining system liveness during network disruptions but at the cost of safety. Finally, we employ game-theoretic models to study the strategies of rational validators within Ethereum PoS, identifying conditions under which these agents might deviate from the prescribed protocol to maximize their rewards.   Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the importance of incentive mechanisms for blockchain robustness and provide insights into designing more resilient blockchain protocols. |
|**2024-11-28**|**Guardians of the Ledger: Protecting Decentralized Exchanges from State Derailment Defects**|Zongwei Li et.al.|[2411.18935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18935)| The decentralized exchange (DEX) leverages smart contracts to trade digital assets for users on the blockchain. Developers usually develop several smart contracts into one project, implementing complex logic functions and multiple transaction operations. However, the interaction among these contracts poses challenges for developers analyzing the state logic. Due to the complex state logic in DEX projects, many critical state derailment defects have emerged in recent years. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of state derailment defects in DEX. We define five categories of state derailment defects and provide detailed analyses of them. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework StateGuard for detecting state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. It leverages a smart contract deconstructor to deconstruct the contract into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which five categories of dependency features are extracted. Next, it implements a graph optimizer to process the structured data. At last, the optimized data is analyzed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to identify potential state derailment defects. We evaluated StateGuard through a dataset of 46 DEX projects containing 5,671 smart contracts, and it achieved 94.25% F1-score. In addition, in a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art, StateGuard leads the F1-score by 6.29%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuar to audit real-world contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs. |

This effectively enhances network resilience by reducing reliance on any single software client implementation. With client diversity, a single bug cannot tear the whole network down. However, despite multiple production-grade client implementations being available, there is still a heavily skewed distribution of clients in Ethereum. This is a concern for the community. In this paper, we introduce a novel conceptual framework for client diversity. The core goal is to improve the network resilience as a systemic property. Our key insight is to leverage economic incentives and verifiable execution to encourage the adoption of minority clients, thereby fostering a more robust blockchain ecosystem. Concretely, we propose to unambiguously and provably identify the client implementation used by any protocol participant, and to use this information to incentivize the usage of minority clients by offering higher participation rewards. We outline a detailed blueprint for our conceptual framework, in the realm of Ethereum. Our proposal is a game changer for improving client diversity of blockchains. Ultimately, it applies to strengthening the resilience of any decentralized distributed systems. |

Many popular database benchmarks are limited in their ability to evaluate this dynamic aspect of the database systems. Those that use synthetic data generators often fail to capture the complexity and unpredictable nature of real data, while most real-world datasets are static and difficult to create high-volume, realistic updates for. This paper introduces CrypQ, a database benchmark leveraging dynamic, public Ethereum blockchain data. CrypQ offers a high-volume, ever-evolving dataset reflecting the unpredictable nature of a real and active cryptocurrency market. We detail CrypQ's schema, procedures for creating data snapshots and update sequences, and a suite of relevant SQL queries. As an example, we demonstrate CrypQ's utility in evaluating cost-based query optimizers on complex, evolving data distributions with real-world skewness and dependencies. |

However, centralized identity systems often compromise user privacy due to online activity tracking or data breaches. At the same time, many online services require digital copies of physical documents for validation in claims processes, such as providing proof of residence for opening a bank account or verifying medical images for health insurance claims. With centralized solutions, privacy depends entirely on the trusted party, but there are emerging decentralized approaches that offer greater transparency.   This article introduces SoverClaim, a decentralized application prototype that empowers users to control their identity and also allows them to present digital documents with privacy. SoverClaim leverages Hyperledger Indy, a blockchain for issuing and presenting self-sovereign digital identities with transparent audit logs, and Storj, a decentralized peer-to-peer service, for secure and decentralized document storage and subsequent deletion. The prototype demonstrates the seamless integration of self-sovereign identities and document-based claims, achieving response times of under 750 ms, making it suitable for timely human interactions. |

It is increasingly adopted for use cases with multiple stakeholders with shared ownership scenarios like digital identity and supply chain management. However, real-world deployments face challenges with mistakes and intrusions. This article presents EvoChain, a chaincode framework extension introducing controlled mutability for data redaction and recovery under time-limited or specific conditions. This mechanism allows corrections during a grace period before immutability takes effect. We validated our approach using WineTracker, a Hyperledger Fabric-based supply chain application. It enables some users to cancel unwanted operations while preserving the blockchain security and maintaining data consistency. Performance evaluations showed minimal overhead with functional benefits. |

Nonetheless, security and privacy concerns continue to pose as prominent challenges in this field. The emergence of blockchain technology, marked by its decentralized nature, tamper-proof attributes, distributed storage functionality, and traceability, has provided novel approaches for resolving these issues. Both of these technologies independently hold vast potential for development; yet, their combination uncovers substantial cross-disciplinary opportunities and growth prospects. The current research tendencies are increasingly concentrating on the integration of blockchain with large language models, with the aim of compensating for their respective limitations through this fusion and promoting further technological evolution. In this study, we evaluate the advantages and developmental constraints of the two technologies, and explore the possibility and development potential of their combination. This paper primarily investigates the technical convergence in two directions: Firstly, the application of large language models to blockchain, where we identify six major development directions and explore solutions to the shortcomings of blockchain technology and their application scenarios; Secondly, the application of blockchain technology to large language models, leveraging the characteristics of blockchain to remedy the deficiencies of large language models and exploring its application potential in multiple fields. |

Such applications leverage advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to automate business processes. The proliferation of modern AI technologies increases the data demand. However, real-world networks often include private and sensitive information of businesses, users, and other organizations. Emerging data-protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) introduce policies around collecting, storing, and managing digital data. While Blockchain technology offers transparency, auditability, and immutability for multi-stakeholder applications, it lacks inherent support for privacy. Typically, privacy support is added to a blockchain-based application by incorporating cryptographic schemes, consent mechanisms, and self-sovereign identity. This article surveys the literature on blockchain-based privacy-preserving systems and identifies the tools for protecting privacy. Besides, consent mechanisms and identity management in the context of blockchain-based systems are also analyzed. The article concludes by highlighting the list of open challenges and further research opportunities. |

However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics. |
|**2024-11-25**|**Data Processing Efficiency Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Blockchain Enabled Metaverse over Wireless Communications**|Liangxin Qian et.al.|[2411.16083](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16083)| In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this need, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored solution for these complex systems. The DAUR algorithm transforms the challenging task of optimizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization problem. It uniquely alternates the optimization of key variables like user association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE. |

Existing studies have found that TE accounting, with its additional layer of verification and disclosure of inter-organizational relationships, could help improve transparency in complex financial and supply chain transactions such as blockchain. Machine learning (ML) presents a promising avenue to augment the transparency advantages of TE accounting. By automating some of the data collection and analysis needed for TE bookkeeping, ML techniques have the potential to make this more transparent accounting method scalable for large organizations with complex international supply chains, further enhancing the visibility and trustworthiness of financial reporting. By leveraging ML algorithms, anomalies within distributed ledger data can be swiftly identified, flagging potential instances of fraud or errors. Furthermore, by delving into transaction relationships over time, ML can untangle intricate webs of transactions, shedding light on obscured dealings and adding an investigative dimension. This paper aims to demonstrate the interaction between TE and ML and how they can leverage transparency levels. |

The Pulsar protocol we propose is designed to facilitate the creation of a proof of stake sidechain for a proof of work blockchain. We present an overview of a novel composable density-based chain selection rule for proof of stake systems which can be seen as a superset of some standard existing longest chain rules for proof of stake protocols. We discuss the Pulsar protocol in comparison to existing proof of stake protocols and define its benefits over existing designs while defining the limitations of the work. Pulsar is currently implemented in the Mintlayer proof of stake Bitcoin sidechain. |

Using sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques on a dataset of tweets and media articles, we assess how the public reacts to the integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain into society. The results highlight a significant polarization of opinions, with a shift from neutral to more definitive stances either embracing or resisting technological impacts. Positive sentiments are often associated with technological enhancements in quality of life and economic opportunities, whereas concerns focus on issues of privacy, data security, and ethical implications. This polarization underscores the need for policymakers to engage proactively with the public to address fears and harness the benefits of 4IR technologies. The findings also advocate for digital literacy and public awareness programs to mitigate misinformation and foster an informed public discourse on future technological integration. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on aligning technological advances with societal values and needs, emphasizing the role of informed public opinion in shaping effective policy. |

However, this growing dependency introduces significant security risks, making it crucial to develop a robust framework to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive secure framework for managing third-party vendor risk, integrating blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability in vendor assessments and interactions. By leveraging blockchain, the framework enhances the integrity of vendor security audits, ensuring that vendor assessments remain up-to-date and tamperproof. This proposed framework leverages smart contracts to reduce human error while ensuring real-time monitoring of compliance and security controls. By evaluating critical security controls-such as data encryption, access control mechanisms, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust architecture-this approach strengthens an organization's defense against emerging cyber threats. Additionally, continuous monitoring enabled by blockchain ensures the immutability and transparency of vendor compliance processes. In this paper, a case study on iHealth's transition to AWS Cloud demonstrates the practical implementation of the framework, showing a significant reduction in vulnerabilities and marked improvement in incident response times. Through the adoption of this blockchain-enabled approach, organizations can mitigate vendor risks, streamline compliance, and enhance their overall security posture. |

This paper proposes TrustMesh, a novel blockchain-enabled framework that addresses these challenges through a unique three-layer architecture combining permissioned blockchain technology with a novel multi-phase Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol. The key innovation lies in TrustMesh's ability to support non-deterministic scheduling algorithms while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance - features traditionally considered mutually exclusive in blockchain systems. The framework supports a sophisticated resource management approach that enables flexible scheduling decisions while preserving the security guarantees of blockchain-based verification. Our experimental evaluation using a real-world cold chain monitoring scenario demonstrates that TrustMesh successfully maintains Byzantine fault tolerance with fault detection latencies under 150 milliseconds, while maintaining consistent framework overhead across varying computational workloads even with network scaling. These results establish TrustMesh's effectiveness in balancing security, performance, and flexibility requirements in trustless IoT environments, advancing the state-of-the-art in secure distributed computing frameworks. |
|**2024-11-19**|**Resonance: Transaction Fees for Heterogeneous Computation**|Maryam Bahrani et.al.|[2411.11789](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11789)| Blockchain networks are facing increasingly heterogeneous computational demands, and in response, protocol designers have started building specialized infrastructure to supply that demand. This paper introduces Resonance: a new kind of transaction fee mechanism for the general two-sided market setting (with users on one side and nodes on the other), where both sides of the market exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. We allow users submitting transactions to have arbitrary valuations for inclusion, nodes responsible for executing transactions to incur arbitrary costs for running any bundle of transactions, and further allow for arbitrary additional constraints on what allocations are valid. These constraints can, for example, be used to prevent state conflicts by requiring transactions that utilize the same part of the network's state to not be executed in parallel. They also enable support for new transaction types, such as transactions that require multiple nodes for execution (e.g. to run multi-party computation for better transaction privacy).   Resonance's design utilizes competition among sophisticated brokers to find individualized prices for each transaction and node. We show that at pure Nash equilibria, Resonance finds an efficient outcome and minimizes the need for strategization by users and nodes. It is also budget-balanced, individually rational for all parties, and computationally tractable. |

However, resource sharing and trading for vehicular task offloading in the PVEC environment usually occur between untrustworthy entities, which compromises the security of data sharing and transactions by vehicles and edge devices. To address these concerns, blockchain is introduced to provide a secure and trustworthy environment for offloading and transactions in PVEC. Nevertheless, due to the mobility of the vehicles, the processes of computing offloading and blockchain transactions are interrupted, which greatly reduces the reliability of the blockchain in edge computing process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PVEC (BPVEC) offloading framework to enhance the security and reliability of the task offloading and transaction. Specifically, a consensus node selection algorithm based on the connected dominating set (CDS) is designed to improve the Hotstuff consensus according to parking time, computing capability and communication quality, which enhances blockchain reliability in computing offloading and transactions. Meanwhile, a Stackelberg game model, establishing the roadside units (RSUs) and parking vehicles (PVs) as leaders and the requesting vehicles (RVs) as follower, is utilized to optimize the offloading strategy and pricing. Subsequently, a BPVEC offloading strategy algorithm with gradient descent method is designed to maximize system revenue. Simulation results show that the proposed BPVEC offloading scheme is secure and reliable while ensuring maximum benefits. |

This paper outlines a strategic roadmap for industries to anticipate and mitigate the risks posed by quantum attacks. Our study explores the development of a quantum-resistant cryptographic solutioning framework for the industry, offering a practical and strategic approach to mitigating quantum attacks. We, here, propose a novel strategic framework, coined name STL-QCRYPTO, outlines tailored, industry-specific methodologies to implement quantum-safe security systems, ensuring long-term protection against the disruptive potential of quantum computing. The following fourteen high-risk sectors: Financial Services, Banking, Healthcare, Critical Infrastructure, Government & Defence, E-commerce, Energy & Utilities, Automotive & Transportation, Cloud Computing & Data Storage, Insurance, Internet & Telecommunications, Blockchain Applications, Metaverse Applications, and Multiagent AI Systems - are critically assessed for their vulnerability to quantum threats. The evaluation emphasizes practical approaches for the deployment of quantum-safe security systems to safeguard these industries against emerging quantum-enabled cyber risks. Additionally, the paper addresses the technical, operational, and regulatory hurdles associated with adopting quantum-resistant technologies.

|**2024-11-15**|**SoK: Consensus for Fair Message Ordering**|Zhuolun Li et.al.|[2411.09981](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09981)| Distributed ledger systems, such as blockchains, rely on consensus protocols that constantly commit messages in an agreed order for processing. In practice, message ordering within these systems is often reward-driven. This raises concerns about fairness, particularly in decentralized finance applications, where nodes can exploit transaction orders to maximize rewards (Maximal Extractable Value, MEV). This paper provides a structured review of consensus protocols that order messages with different approaches, especially focusing on the ones that promote order fairness, using methods including First-In-First-Out (FIFO), random, and blind ordering. We review the challenges and trade-offs of deriving fair message ordering in a Byzantine fault-tolerant setting, and summarize the key steps for making a fair message ordering consensus protocol. We introduce a design guideline, with which we propose a performance optimization to the state-of-the-art FIFO ordering protocol Themis. This work establishes a unified framework for accessing and enhancing fairness in distributed ledger systems. |
|**2024-11-14**|**Scalable Readability Evaluation for Graph Layouts: 2D Geometric Distributed Algorithms**|Sanggeon Yun et.al.|[2411.09809](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09809)| Graphs, consisting of vertices and edges, are vital for representing complex relationships in fields like social networks, finance, and blockchain. Visualizing these graphs helps analysts identify structural patterns, with readability metrics-such as node occlusion and edge crossing-assessing layout clarity. However, calculating these metrics is computationally intensive, making scalability a challenge for large graphs. Without efficient readability metrics, layout generation processes-despite numerous studies focused on accelerating them-face bottleneck, making it challenging to select or produce optimized layouts swiftly. Previous approaches attempted to accelerate this process through machine learning models. Machine learning approaches aimed to predict readability scores from rendered images of graphs. While these models offered some improvement, they struggled with scalability and accuracy, especially for graphs with thousands of nodes. For instance, this approach requires substantial memory to process large images, as it relies on rendered images of the graph; graphs with more than 600 nodes cannot be inputted into the model, and errors can exceed 55% in some readability metrics due to difficulties in generalizing across diverse graph layouts. This study addresses these limitations by introducing scalable algorithms for readability evaluation in distributed environments, utilizing Spark's DataFrame and GraphFrame frameworks to efficiently manage large data volumes across multiple machines. Experimental results show that these distributed algorithms significantly reduce computation time, achieving up to a 17x speedup for node occlusion and a 146x improvement for edge crossing on large datasets. These enhancements make scalable graph readability evaluation practical and efficient, overcoming the limitations of previous machine-learning approaches. |

Existing data-sharing schemes often rely on computationally expensive cryptographic operations and centralized key management, limiting their effectiveness for resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose an efficient, secure blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. First, our scheme adopts a distributed key generation method, which avoids single point of failure. This method also allows independent pseudonym generation and key updates, enhancing authentication flexibility while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the scheme provides a complete data-sharing process, covering data uploading, storage, and sharing, while ensuring data traceability, integrity, and privacy. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is theoretically secure and resistant to various attacks, while performance evaluations demonstrate lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing solutions, making it both secure and efficient for IoT applications. |

Recent research has identified new classes of "machine un-auditable" bugs that arise from both transactional contexts and source code. Existing detection methods require human understanding of underlying transaction logic and manual reasoning across different sources of context (i.e. modalities), such as code, dynamic transaction executions, and natural language specifying the expected transaction behavior.   To automate the detection of ``machine un-auditable'' bugs, we present SmartInv, an accurate and fast smart contract invariant inference framework. Our key insight is that the expected behavior of smart contracts, as specified by invariants, relies on understanding and reasoning across multimodal information, such as source code and natural language. We propose a new prompting strategy to foundation models, Tier of Thought (ToT), to reason across multiple modalities of smart contracts and ultimately to generate invariants. By checking the violation of these generated invariants, SmartInv can identify potential vulnerabilities.   We evaluate SmartInv on real-world contracts and re-discover bugs that resulted in multi-million dollar losses over the past 2.5 years (from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2023). Our extensive evaluation shows that SmartInv generates (3.5X) more bug-critical invariants and detects (4 $\times$ ) more critical bugs compared to the state-of-the-art tools in significantly (150X) less time. \sys uncovers 119 zero-day vulnerabilities from the 89,621 real-world contracts. Among them, five are critical zero-day bugs confirmed by developers as ``high severity.'' |

For all its promises, and like any technological advancement, O-RAN is not without risks that need to be carefully assessed and properly addressed to accelerate its wide adoption in future mobile networks. In this paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the O-RAN architecture, discussing the potential threats that may arise in the different O-RAN architecture layers and their impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. We also promote the potential of zero trust, Moving Target Defense (MTD), blockchain, and large language models(LLM) technologies in fortifying O-RAN's security posture. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of MTD in empowering robust deep reinforcement learning methods for dynamic network slice admission control in the O-RAN architecture. Moreover, we examine the effect of explainable AI (XAI) based on LLMs in securing the system. |

This is because information about reviewer efforts and author feedback typically remains local to a single venue, while the same group of authors and reviewers participate in the publication process across many venues. Previous attempts to incentivize the reviewing process assume that the quality of reviews and papers authored correlate for the same person, or they assume that the reviewers can receive physical rewards for their work. In this paper, we aim to keep track of reviewing and authoring efforts by users (who review and author) across different venues while ensuring self-incentivization. We show that our system, DecentPeeR, incentivizes reviewers to behave according to the rules, i.e., it has a unique Nash equilibrium in which virtuous behavior is rewarded. |

This rule helps invalidate blocks that are withheld by adversaries for a certain period. However, existing last-generated rules face an issue in that their applications to the system are not fully localized. In conservative cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, it is desirable for methods to be applied in a fully local manner. In this paper, we propose a locally applicable last-generated rule. Our method is straightforward and is based on a relative time reference. By conservatively setting the upper bound for the clock skews $\Delta_{O_i}$ to 200 s, our proposed method reduces the proportion $\gamma$ of honest miners following the attacker during chain ties by more than 40% compared to existing local methods. |

Some of them can use blockchains as their underlying infrastructure. A blockchain requires participants to agree on its contents. This can be achieved via a consensus protocol, and several BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) protocols have been proposed for this purpose. How do these protocols differ in performance? And how is this difference affected by the communication network? Moreover, such a protocol would need a timer to ensure progress, but how should the timer be set?   This paper presents an analytical model to address these and related issues in the case of crash faults. Specifically, it focuses on two consensus protocols (Istanbul BFT and HotStuff) and two network topologies (Folded-Clos and Dragonfly). The model provides closed-form expressions for analyzing how the timer value and number of participants, faults and switches affect the consensus time. The formulas and analyses are validated with simulations. The conclusion offers some tips for analytical modeling of such protocols. |

The study constructs a three-player evolutionary game model involving banks, core enterprises, and SMEs to analyze how fintech innovations, such as big data credit assessment, blockchain, and AI-driven risk evaluation, influence financial risks and access to credit. The findings reveal that banking fintech reduces financing costs and mitigates financial risks by improving transaction reliability, enhancing risk identification, and minimizing information asymmetry. By optimizing cooperation between banks, core enterprises, and SMEs, fintech solutions enhance the stability of the agricultural supply chain, contributing to rural revitalization goals and sustainable agricultural development. The study provides new theoretical insights and practical recommendations for improving agricultural finance systems and reducing financial risks.

However, the rise of Ponzi schemes in smart contracts poses significant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in blockchain systems. Existing detection methods, such as PonziGuard, depend on large amounts of labeled data and struggle to identify unseen Ponzi schemes, limiting their reliability and generalizability. In contrast, we introduce PonziSleuth, the first LLM-driven approach for detecting Ponzi smart contracts, which requires no labeled training data. PonziSleuth utilizes advanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs to analyze smart contract source code through a novel two-step zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique. Our extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and real-world contracts demonstrates that PonziSleuth delivers comparable, and often superior, performance without the extensive data requirements, achieving a balanced detection accuracy of 96.06% with GPT-3.5-turbo, 93.91% with LLAMA3, and 94.27% with Mistral. In real-world detection, PonziSleuth successfully identified 15 new Ponzi schemes from 4,597 contracts verified by Etherscan in March 2024, with a false negative rate of 0% and a false positive rate of 0.29%. These results highlight PonziSleuth's capability to detect diverse and novel Ponzi schemes, marking a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security and mitigating financial scams. |

Despite its potential, existing sharding solutions face significant limitations in handling dynamic workloads, ensuring secure cross-shard transactions, and maintaining system integrity. To address these gaps, we propose DynaShard, a dynamic and secure cross-shard transaction processing mechanism designed to enhance blockchain sharding efficiency and security. DynaShard combines adaptive shard management, a hybrid consensus approach, plus an efficient state synchronization and dispute resolution protocol. Our performance evaluation, conducted using a robust experimental setup with real-world network conditions and transaction workloads, demonstrates DynaShard's superior throughput, reduced latency, and improved shard utilization compared to the FTBS method. Specifically, DynaShard achieves up to a 42.6% reduction in latency and a 78.77% improvement in shard utilization under high transaction volumes and varying cross-shard transaction ratios. These results highlight DynaShard's ability to outperform state-of-the-art sharding methods, ensuring scalable and resilient blockchain systems. We believe that DynaShard's innovative approach will significantly impact future developments in blockchain technology, paving the way for more efficient and secure distributed systems. |

The traditional reservation systems encounter issues related to the expansion of the systems, the integrity of the data provided and the level of service offered to the customers, which is the main focus of this architecture through the modular and data centric design approaches. This will allow different operations such as reservations, payments, and customer data management among others to be performed separately thereby facilitating high availability of the system by 30% and enhancing performance of the system by 40% on its scalability. Such systems contain AI driven modules that utilize the past booking patterns along with the profile of the customer to estimate the demand and make recommendations, which increases to 25 % of customer engagement. Moreover, blockchain is effective in engaging an incorruptible ledger system for the all transactions therefore mitigating fraud incidences and increasing the clarity by 20%. The system was subjected to analysis using a simulator and using machine learning evaluations that rated it against other conventional systems. The results show that there were clear enhancements in the speed of transactions where the rates of secure data processing rose by 35%, and the system response time by 15 %. The system can also be used for other high transaction industries like logistics and hospitality. This structural design is indicative of how the use of advanced technologies will revolutionize the airline reservation sector. The implications are growing effectiveness, improvement in security and greater customer contentment. |

It examines the implications of emerging quantum algorithms and cryptographic techniques such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Oblivious Transfer (OT). While exploring how CBDCs and cryptocurrencies might integrate defenses like post-quantum cryptography, it highlights the substantial hurdles in transitioning legacy systems and fostering widespread adoption of new standards. The paper includes comprehensive evaluations of CBDCs in a quantum context. It also features comparisons to alternative cryptocurrency models. Additionally, the paper provides insightful analyses of pertinent quantum methodologies. Examinations of interfaces between these methods and blockchain architectures are also included. The paper carries out considered appraisals of quantum threats and their relevance for cryptocurrency schemes. Furthermore, it features discussions of the influence of anticipated advances in quantum computing on algorithms and their applications. The paper renders the judicious conclusion that long-term coexistence is viable provided challenges are constructively addressed through ongoing collaborative efforts to validate solutions and guide evolving policies. |
|**2024-11-09**|**Smart-LLaMA: Two-Stage Post-Training of Large Language Models for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection and Explanation**|Lei Yu et.al.|[2411.06221](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06221)| With the rapid development of blockchain technology, smart contract security has become a critical challenge. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods face three main issues: (1) Insufficient quality of datasets, lacking detailed explanations and precise vulnerability locations. (2) Limited adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to the smart contract domain, as most LLMs are pre-trained on general text data but minimal smart contract-specific data. (3) Lack of high-quality explanations for detected vulnerabilities, as existing methods focus solely on detection without clear explanations. These limitations hinder detection performance and make it harder for developers to understand and fix vulnerabilities quickly, potentially leading to severe financial losses. To address these problems, we propose Smart-LLaMA, an advanced detection method based on the LLaMA language model. First, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering four vulnerability types with labels, detailed explanations, and precise vulnerability locations. Second, we introduce Smart Contract-Specific Continual Pre-Training, using raw smart contract data to enable the LLM to learn smart contract syntax and semantics, enhancing their domain adaptability. Furthermore, we propose Explanation-Guided Fine-Tuning, which fine-tunes the LLM using paired vulnerable code and explanations, enabling both vulnerability detection and reasoned explanations. We evaluate explanation quality through LLM and human evaluation, focusing on Correctness, Completeness, and Conciseness. Experimental results show that Smart-LLaMA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 6.49% in F1 score and 3.78% in accuracy, while providing reliable explanations. |

In this paper, we demonstrate that the security vulnerabilities of PoW-based blockchain extend beyond what these mining attacks initially reveal. We introduce a novel mining strategy, named BM-PAW, which yields superior rewards for both the attacker and the targeted pool compared to the state-of-the-art mining attack: PAW. Our analysis reveals that BM-PAW attackers are incentivized to offer appropriate bribe money to other targets, as they comply with the attacker's directives upon receiving payment. We find the BM-PAW attacker can circumvent the "miner's dilemma" through equilibrium analysis in a two-pool BM-PAW game scenario, wherein the outcome is determined by the attacker's mining power. We finally propose practical countermeasures to mitigate these novel pool attacks. |

However, as commercial use expands, LEO satellite networks face heightened cyberattack risks, especially through satellite-to-satellite communication links, which are more vulnerable than ground-based connections. As the number of operational satellites continues to grow, addressing these security challenges becomes increasingly critical. Traditional approaches, which focus on sending models to ground stations for validation, often overlook the limited communication windows available to LEO satellites, leaving critical security risks unaddressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sharded blockchain-based federated learning framework for LEO networks, called SBFL-LEO. This framework improves the reliability of inter-satellite communications using blockchain technology and assigns specific roles to each satellite. Miner satellites leverage cosine similarity (CS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify malicious models and monitor each other to detect inaccurate aggregated models. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both model accuracy and energy efficiency, significantly enhancing system robustness against attacks. |

Energy sharing has also been proposed as a solution, addressing affordability issues while reducing consumers' greed. In this paper, we analyse the feasibility of two energy sharing algorithms, centralized and peer-to-peer, within two scenarios, between microgrids within a county, and between microgrids across counties. In addition, we propose a new sharing algorithm named Selfish Sharing, where prosumers take advantage of consumers' batteries in return for letting them consume part of the shared energy. The results for sharing between microgrids across counties show that the dependency on the grid could be reduced by approximately 5.72%, 6.12%, and 5.93% using the centralized, peer-to-peer and selfish sharing algorithms respectively, compared to trading only. The scenario of sharing between microgrids within a county has an average decrease in dependency on the grid by 5.66%, 6.0%, and 5.80% using the centralized, peer-to-peer and selfish algorithms respectively, compared to trading without sharing. We found that trading with batteries and the proposed sharing algorithms prove to be beneficial in the sharing between microgrids case. More specifically, the case of trading and sharing energy between microgrids across counties outperforms sharing within a county, with P2P sharing appearing to be superior. |

Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research. |

However, the literature highlights several successful side-channel attacks on hardware wallets that exploit SECP256K1 to extract private keys. This work proposes a novel hardware architecture for SECP256K1, optimized for side-channel attack resistance and efficient resource utilization. The architecture incorporates complete addition formulas, temporary registers, and parallel processing techniques, making elliptic curve point addition and doubling operations indistinguishable. Implementation results demonstrate an average reduction of 45% in LUT usage compared to similar works, emphasizing the design's resource efficiency. |

However, the development and deployment of AI are almost entirely controlled by a few powerful organizations that are racing to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The centralized entities make decisions with little public oversight, shaping the future of humanity, often with unforeseen consequences. In this paper, we propose OML, which stands for Open, Monetizable, and Loyal AI, an approach designed to democratize AI development. OML is realized through an interdisciplinary framework spanning AI, blockchain, and cryptography. We present several ideas for constructing OML using technologies such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), traditional cryptographic primitives like fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption, obfuscation, and AI-native solutions rooted in the sample complexity and intrinsic hardness of AI tasks. A key innovation of our work is introducing a new scientific field: AI-native cryptography. Unlike conventional cryptography, which focuses on discrete data and binary security guarantees, AI-native cryptography exploits the continuous nature of AI data representations and their low-dimensional manifolds, focusing on improving approximate performance. One core idea is to transform AI attack methods, such as data poisoning, into security tools. This novel approach serves as a foundation for OML 1.0 which uses model fingerprinting to protect the integrity and ownership of AI models. The spirit of OML is to establish a decentralized, open, and transparent platform for AI development, enabling the community to contribute, monetize, and take ownership of AI models. By decentralizing control and ensuring transparency through blockchain technology, OML prevents the concentration of power and provides accountability in AI development that has not been possible before. |

However, the heavy decryption overhead hinders its widespread adoption. A general approach to address this issue is to outsource decryption to decryption cloud service(DCS). Existing schemes have utilized various methods to enable users to verify outsourced results; however, they lack an effective mechanism to achieve exemptibility which enables the honest DCS to escape from wrong claims. And it is impractical to assume that the DCS will provide free services. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based payable outsourced decryption ABE scheme that achieves both verifiability and exemptibility without adding redundant information to ABE ciphertext. We use zero-knowledge proof to verify outsourced results on blockchain and introduce an optional single-round challenge game under optimistic assumption to address the high cost of proof generation. Moreover, our system achieves fairness and decentralized outsourcing to protect the interests of all parties. Finally, we implement and evaluate our scheme on Ethereum to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency, the gas usage in attribute numbers from 5 to 60 is 11 $\times$ to 140$\times$ in the happy case and 4$\times$ to 55$\times$ in the challenge case lower than the scheme of Ge et al. (TDSC'23). |

The proposed method leverages blockchain technology for decentralized, transparent, and secure MAP selection, while the multi-path transmission strategy enhances network reliability and reduces communication delays. A trust-based attack detection mechanism is integrated to ensure network security. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces both handover frequency and average communication delay by over 80%, and successfully identifies and excludes more than 95% of Sybil nodes, ensuring reliable and secure communication in highly dynamic vehicular environments. |

Using cryptographic techniques, threshold signature oracles can achieve consensus on data from multiple nodes and provide corresponding proofs to ensure the credibility and security of the information. However, in real-time data acquisition, threshold signature methods face challenges such as data inconsistency and low success rates in heterogeneous environments, which limit their practical application potential. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative dual-strategy approach to enhance the success rate of data consensus in blockchain threshold signature oracles. Firstly, we introduce a Representative Enhanced Aggregation Strategy (REP-AG) that improves the representativeness of data submitted by nodes, ensuring consistency with data from other nodes, and thereby enhancing the usability of threshold signatures. Additionally, we present a Timing Optimization Strategy (TIM-OPT) that dynamically adjusts the timing of nodes' access to data sources to maximize consensus success rates. Experimental results indicate that REP-AG improves the aggregation success rate by approximately 56.6\% compared to the optimal baseline, while the implementation of TIM-OPT leads to an average increase of approximately 32.9\% in consensus success rates across all scenarios. |

Nguyen et.al.|[2411.02773](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02773)| Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method for training with private data locally stored in distributed machines without gathering them into one place for central learning. Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do. |

Wang et.al.|[2411.02709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02709)| In this study, the novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed in carbon price fluctuation prediction. Specifically, a research framework integrating DILATED Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the combined framework is that it can make feature extraction more efficient. Then, based on the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework, the L1 and L2 parameter norm penalty as regularization method is adopted to predict. Referring to the characteristics of high correlation between energy indicator price and blockchain information in previous literature, and we primarily includes indicators related to blockchain information through regularization process. Based on the above methods, this paper uses a dataset containing an amount of data to carry out the carbon price prediction. The experimental results show that the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework is superior to the traditional CNN-LSTM architecture. Blockchain information can effectively predict the price. Since parameter norm penalty as regularization, Ridge Regression (RR) as L2 regularization is better than Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD) as L1 regularization in price forecasting. Thus, the proposed RR-DILATED CNN-LSTM approach can effectively and accurately predict the fluctuation trend of the carbon price. Therefore, the new forecasting methods and theoretical ecology proposed in this study provide a new basis for trend prediction and evaluating digital assets policy represented by the carbon price for both the academia and practitioners. |

They support transaction types that are native to the blockchain platform or user-defined via user programs called smart contracts. Despite the significant flexibility in transaction programmability that smart contracts offer, they pose several usability, robustness, and performance challenges.   This paper proposes an alternative transaction framework that incorporates more primitives into the native set of transaction types (reducing the likelihood of requiring user-defined transaction programs often). The framework is based on the concept of declarative blockchain transactions whose strength lies in the fact that it addresses several of the limitations of smart contracts simultaneously. A formal and implementation framework is presented, and a subset of commonly occurring transaction behaviors are modeled and implemented as use cases, using an open-source blockchain database, BigchchainDB, as the implementation context. A performance study comparing the declarative transaction approach to equivalent smart contract transaction models reveals several advantages of the proposed approach. |

In order to address these challenges, this paper considers a digital twin (DT) and blockchain-assisted federated learning (FL) scheme. To facilitate the FL process, we initially employ fog devices with abundant computational capabilities to generate DT for resource-constrained edge devices, thereby aiding them in local training. Subsequently, we formulate an FL delay minimization problem for FL, which considers both of model transmission time and synchronization time, also incorporates cooperative jamming to ensure secure synchronization of DT. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a decomposition algorithm. In particular, we introduce upper limits on the local device training delay and the effects of aggregation jamming as auxiliary variables, thereby transforming the problem into a convex optimization problem that can be decomposed for independent solution. Finally, a blockchain verification mechanism is employed to guarantee the integrity of the model uploading throughout the FL process and the identities of the participants. The final global model is obtained from the verified local and global models within the blockchain through the application of deep learning techniques. The efficacy of our proposed cooperative interference-based FL process has been verified through numerical analysis, which demonstrates that the integrated DT blockchain-assisted FL scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of execution time, block optimization, and accuracy. |

These protocols are powered by highly complex pipelines that process deterministic programs, called circuits, written in one of many domain-specific programming languages, e.g., Circom, Noir, and others. Logic bugs in circuit-processing pipelines could have catastrophic consequences and cause significant financial and reputational damage. As an example, consider that a logic bug in a ZK pipeline could result in attackers stealing identities or assets. It is, therefore, critical to develop effective techniques for checking their correctness.   In this paper, we present the first systematic fuzzing technique for ZK pipelines, which uses metamorphic test oracles to detect critical logic bugs. We have implemented our technique in an open-source tool called Circuzz. We used Circuzz to test four significantly different ZK pipelines and found a total of 16 logic bugs in all pipelines. Due to their critical nature, 15 of our bugs have already been fixed by the pipeline developers. |

The DECS utilizes swap transaction monitoring and simulation techniques to provide unbiased comparisons of swap rates across various DEXes and aggregators. Analysis of almost 1.2 million transactions across multiple blockchain networks demonstrates that both 1inch Classic and 1inch Fusion consistently outperform competitors. These findings not only validate 1inch's superior rates but also provide valuable insights for continuous protocol optimization and underscore the critical role of data-driven decision-making in advancing DeFi infrastructure. |

|**2024-11-01**|**3-Slot-Finality Protocol for Ethereum**|Francesco D'Amato et.al.|[2411.00558](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00558)| Gasper, the consensus protocol currently employed by Ethereum, typically requires 64 to 95 slots -- the units of time during which a new chain extending the previous one by one block is proposed and voted -- to finalize. This means that under ideal conditions -- where the network is synchronous, and all chain proposers, along with more than two-thirds of the validators, behave as dictated by the protocol -- proposers construct blocks on a non-finalized chain that extends at least 64 blocks. This exposes a significant portion of the blockchain to potential reorganizations during changes in network conditions, such as periods of asynchrony. Specifically, this finalization delay heightens the network's exposure to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) exploits, which could undermine the network's integrity. Furthermore, the extended finalization period forces users to balance the trade-off between economic security and transaction speed.   To address these issues and speed up finality, we introduce a partially synchronous finality gadget, which we combine with two dynamically available consensus protocols -- synchronous protocols that ensure safety and liveness even with fluctuating validator participation levels. This integration results in secure ebb-and-flow protocols [SP 2021], achieving finality within three slots after a proposal and realizing 3-slot finality. |

|**2024-11-01**|**Typosquatting 3.0: Characterizing Squatting in Blockchain Naming Systems**|Muhammad Muzammil et.al.|[2411.00352](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00352)| A Blockchain Name System (BNS) simplifies the process of sending cryptocurrencies by replacing complex cryptographic recipient addresses with human-readable names, making the transactions more convenient. Unfortunately, these names can be susceptible to typosquatting attacks, where attackers can take advantage of user typos by registering typographically similar BNS names. Unsuspecting users may accidentally mistype or misinterpret the intended name, resulting in an irreversible transfer of funds to an attacker's address instead of the intended recipient. In this work, we present the first large-scale, intra-BNS typosquatting study. To understand the prevalence of typosquatting within BNSs, we study three different services (Ethereum Name Service, Unstoppable Domains, and ADAHandles) spanning three blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, and Cardano), collecting a total of 4.9M BNS names and 200M transactions-the largest dataset for BNSs to date. We describe the challenges involved in conducting name-squatting studies on these alternative naming systems, and then perform an in-depth quantitative analysis of our dataset. We find that typosquatters are indeed active on BNSs, registering more malicious domains with each passing year. Our analysis reveals that users have sent thousands of transactions to squatters and that squatters target both globally popular BNS domain names as well as the domains owned by popular Twitter/X users. Lastly, we document the complete lack of defenses against typosquatting in custodial and non-custodial wallets and propose straightforward countermeasures that can protect users without relying on third-party services. |
|**2024-11-11**|**Examining Attacks on Consensus and Incentive Systems in Proof-of-Work Blockchains: A Systematic Literature Review**|Dinitha Wijewardhana et.al.|[2411.00349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00349)| Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their transparency, security, and accessibility compared to traditional financial systems, with Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, leading the market. Bitcoin's security relies on blockchain technology - a decentralized ledger consisting of a consensus and an incentive mechanism. The consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW), requires miners to solve difficult cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks, while the incentive mechanism rewards them with newly minted bitcoins. However, as Bitcoin's acceptance grows, it faces increasing threats from attacks targeting these mechanisms, such as selfish mining, double-spending, and block withholding. These attacks compromise security, efficiency, and reward distribution. Recent research shows that these attacks can be combined with each other or with either malicious strategies, such as network-layer attacks, or non-malicious strategies, like honest mining. These combinations lead to more sophisticated attacks, increasing the attacker's success rates and profitability. Therefore, understanding and evaluating these attacks is essential for developing effective countermeasures and ensuring long-term security. This paper begins by examining individual attacks executed in isolation and their profitability. It then explores how combining these attacks with each other or with other malicious and non-malicious strategies can enhance their overall effectiveness and profitability. The analysis further explores how the deployment of attacks such as selfish mining and block withholding by multiple competing mining pools against each other impacts their economic returns. Lastly, a set of design guidelines is provided, outlining areas future work should focus on to prevent or mitigate the identified threats. |

Applications built on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) hold the power to move society closer towards the ideal metaverse through innovations like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Due to a combination of the infancy of this technology and the significant implications it holds in the public and private sectors, adoption across both sectors is currently limited. To foster the creation of sustainable smart cities built on this technology, education on how this technology may function in an integrated metaverse is paramount. This is due to the necessary compatibility across industries needed between public and private data. As certain industries are more regulated than others, such as finance or healthcare, a robust system is needed to allow for varying degrees of freedom. This chapter illustrates numerous facets of this conceptual framework. |

Zerebro, an AI fine-tuned on schizophrenic responses and scraped conversations of Andy Ayrey's infinite backrooms, autonomously creates and spreads disruptive memes across online platforms. It also mints unique ASCII artwork on blockchain networks and launched a memecoin amassing a 3 million USD market cap after migrating to Raydium. Based on our research, Zerebro is the first cross-chain AI, seamlessly interacting with multiple blockchains. By exploring its architecture, content generation techniques, and blockchain integration, this study uncovers how hyperstition, fictions becoming reality through viral propagation, emerges in AI, driven meme culture and decentralized finance. Through historical examples of memetic influence, we reveal how AI systems like Zerebro are not merely participants but architects of culture, cognition, and finance. |

However, existing schemes for on-chain data queries face a challenge between verifiability and efficiency. Queries on blockchain databases can compromise the authenticity of the query results, while schemes that utilize on-chain Authenticated Data Structure (ADS) have lower efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient and verifiable on-chain data query framework EVeCA. In our approach, we free the full nodes from the task of ADS maintenance by delegating it to a limited number of nodes, and full nodes verify the correctness of ADS by using challenge-based authentication scheme instead of reconstructing them, which prevents the service providers from maintaining incorrect ADS with overwhelming probability. By carefully designing the ADS verification scheme, EVeCA achieves higher efficiency while remaining resilient against adaptive attacks. Our framework effectively eliminates the need for on-chain ADS maintenance, and allows full nodes to participate in ADS maintenance in a cost-effective way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through security analysis and experimental evaluation. Compared to existing schemes, our approach improves ADS maintenance efficiency by about 20*. |

However, this shift also presents significant challenges, including high barriers to becoming a validator, restrictions on the liquidity of staked Ether (ETH), and the risk of centralization due to staking pool dynamics. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring two innovative solutions: EigenLayer and Lido.   EigenLayer is a middleware solution enabling restaking, allowing validators to secure multiple protocols and thereby increasing decentralization and profitability. Lido, a liquid staking protocol, simplifies participation by issuing stETH tokens that retain liquidity, allowing users to earn rewards without long-term lock-up constraints. This paper provides a detailed analysis of how these technologies mitigate key PoS challenges, reduce validator entry barriers, unlock staked capital, and improve decentralization. We conclude with an evaluation of the combined potential of EigenLayer and Lido to foster a more resilient and inclusive Ethereum ecosystem, setting the stage for further advancements in decentralized finance. |

Thus, in this context, it is important to understand how these digital assets can be transmitted, both legally and efficiently, in the event of the death of their owner. The present paper analyses the mechanisms of cryptocurrencies, analysing from a technical point of view aspects related to blockchain technology, virtual wallets or cryptographic keys, as well as various types of operations regarding this type of virtual currencies. The study also examines the legal aspects related to cryptocurrencies, with an emphasis on the diversity of their status in different global jurisdictions as well as the impact on inheritance planning. The case studies present tangible examples related to successions with cryptocurrencies as the main object, thus completing the exposition related to the main challenges faced by the heirs in the transfer process. In this way, this paper offers possible solutions and recommendations related to inheritance planning with cryptocurrencies as its main object, including the legal and fiscal aspects that must be taken into account when planning a digital succession. |

This technology is characterized by its distributed, decentralized, and immutable ledger system which serves as a fundamental platform for managing smart contract transactions (SCTs). However, these self-executing codes implemented using blockchains undergo sequential validation within a block which introduces performance bottlenecks. In response, this paper introduces a framework called the Multi-Bin Parallel Scheduler (MBPS) designed for parallelizing blockchain smart contract transactions to leverage the capabilities of multicore systems. Our proposed framework facilitates concurrent execution of SCTs, enhancing performance by allowing non-conflicting transactions to be processed simultaneously while preserving deterministic order. The framework comprises of three vital stages: conflict detection, bin creation and execution. We conducted an evaluation of our MBPS framework in Hyperledger Sawtooth v1.2.6, revealing substantial performance enhancements compared to existing parallel SCT execution frameworks across various smart contract applications. This research contributes to the ongoing optimization efforts in blockchain technology demonstrating its potential for scalability and efficiency in real-world scenarios. |
|**2024-10-29**|**Bitcoin and Shadow Exchange Rates**|Yanan Niu et.al.|[2410.22443](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22443)| This research expands the existing literature on Bitcoin (BTC) price misalignments by incorporating transaction-level data from a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, LocalBitcoins.com (LB). It examines how broader economic and regulatory factors influence cryptocurrency markets and highlights the role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating international capital movements. By constructing shadow exchange rates (SERs) for national currencies against the US dollar based on BTC prices, we calculate discrepancies between these SERs and their official exchange rates (OERs), referred to as BTC premiums. We analyze various factors driving the BTC premiums on LB, including those sourced from the BTC blockchain, mainstream centralized BTC exchanges, and international capital transfer channels. Unlike in centralized markets, our results indicate that the microstructure of the BTC blockchain does not correlate with BTC premiums in the P2P market. Regarding frictions from international capital transfers, we interpret remittance costs as indicators of inefficiencies in traditional capital transfer systems. For constrained currencies subject to severe capital controls and managed exchange rate regimes, increased transaction costs in conventional currency exchange channels almost entirely translate into higher BTC premiums. Additionally, our analysis suggests that BTC premiums can serve as short-term predictors of future exchange rate depreciation for unconstrained currencies. |

This leads to fluctuating transaction fee prices and limits the flexibility of users' payment options. To address these issues, we propose MStableChain, which leverage multiple stablecoins as native tokens for transaction fee settlements, thus ensuring stable transaction fees and flexible payment options. To address the challenges of mass adoption and practicality, we propose several core designs. To maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for mass adoption while supporting multiple native stablecoins, MStableChain employs a multi-currency units, multi-type RPCs mechanism. This mechanism enables the system to handle multiple stablecoins without altering the EVM or requiring changes to user applications. Furthermore, an oracle-based gas fee adjustment mechanism is proposed to manage exchange rates between different stablecoins, ensuring equitable transaction costs across various currencies. The system also introduces a secure, on-chain voting-based management protocol for the administrative functions related to these stablecoins. Experimental results from a prototype implementation demonstrate that MStableChain provides stable transaction fee prices, high effectiveness, and good usability. |

Several studies have been conducted on both techniques, but the research on combining the two is scarce. To cover this knowledge gap, we introduce a weighted voting approach on Hotstuff, along with two optimisations targeting weight assignment distribution and leader rotation in the underlying state replication protocol. Moreover, the weighted protocols developed rely on studies proving the effectiveness of a specific voting power assignment based on discrete values. We generalise this approach by presenting a novel continuous weighting scheme applied to the Hotstuff protocol to highlight the effectiveness of this technique in faulty scenarios. We prove the significant latency reduction impact of weighted voting on streamlined protocols and advocate for further research. |

Existing training datasets employed for vulnerability detection tools may be limited, potentially compromising their efficacy. This paper presents a method for improving the quantity and quality of smart contract vulnerability datasets and evaluates current detection methods. The approach centers around semantic-preserving code transformation, a technique that modifies the source code structure without altering its semantic meaning. The transformed code snippets are inserted into all potential locations within benign smart contract code, creating new vulnerable contract versions. This method aims to generate a wider variety of vulnerable codes, including those that can bypass detection by current analysis tools. The paper experiments evaluate the method's effectiveness using tools like Slither, Mythril, and CrossFuzz, focusing on metrics like the number of generated vulnerable samples and the false negative rate in detecting these vulnerabilities. The improved results show that many newly created vulnerabilities can bypass tools and the false reporting rate goes up to 100% and increases dataset size minimum by 2.5X. |

Wearable devices serve as bridges between the real world and the metaverse. To provide intelligent services without revealing users' privacy in the metaverse, leveraging federated learning (FL) to train models on local wearable devices is a promising solution. However, centralized model aggregation in traditional FL may suffer from external attacks, resulting in a single point of failure. Furthermore, the absence of incentive mechanisms may weaken users' participation during FL training, leading to degraded performance of the trained model and reduced quality of intelligent services. In this paper, we propose BF-Meta, a secure blockchain-empowered FL framework with decentralized model aggregation, to mitigate the negative influence of malicious users and provide secure virtual services in the metaverse. In addition, we design an incentive mechanism to give feedback to users based on their behaviors. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of BF-Meta. |
|**2024-10-28**|**Policies for Fair Exchanges of Resources**|Lorenzo Ceragioli et.al.|[2410.21214](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21214)| People increasingly use digital platforms to exchange resources in accordance to some policies stating what resources users offer and what they require in return. In this paper, we propose a formal model of these environments, focussing on how users' policies are defined and enforced, so ensuring that malicious users cannot take advantage of honest ones. To that end, we introduce the declarative policy language MuAC and equip it with a formal semantics. To determine if a resource exchange is fair, i.e., if it respects the MuAC policies in force, we introduce the non-standard logic MuACL that combines non-linear, linear and contractual aspects, and prove it decidable. Notably, the operator for contractual implication of MuACL is not expressible in linear logic. We define a semantics preserving compilation of MuAC policies into MuACL, thus establishing that exchange fairness is reduced to finding a proof in MuACL. Finally, we show how this approach can be put to work on a blockchain to exchange non-fungible tokens. |

Traditional methods for assessing well-being often face significant challenges, with a major issue being the lack of trust and confidence employees may have in these processes. Employees may hesitate to provide honest feedback due to concerns not only about data integrity and confidentiality, but also about power imbalances among stakeholders. In this context, blockchain-based decentralised surveys, leveraging the immutability, transparency, and pseudo-anonymity of blockchain technology, offer significant improvements in aligning responsive actions with employees' feedback securely and transparently. Nevertheless, their implementation raises complex issues regarding the balance between trust and confidence. While blockchain can function as a confidence machine for data processing and management, it does not inherently address the equally important cultural element of trust. To effectively integrate blockchain technology into well-being assessments, decentralised well-being surveys must be supported by cultural practices that build and sustain trust. Drawing on blockchain technology management and relational cultural theory, we explain how trust-building can be achieved through the co-production of decentralised well-being surveys, which helps address power imbalances between the implementation team and stakeholders. Our goal is to provide a dual cultural-technological framework along with conceptual clarity on how the technological implementation of confidence can connect with the cultural development of trust, ensuring that blockchain-based decentralised well-being surveys are not only secure and reliable but also perceived as trustworthy vector to improve workplace conditions. |

Fortunately, since the first blockchain was conceived in 2008 (the one that supports Bitcoin), hardware and consensus protocols have evolved, decreasing energy consumption significantly. This article describes a green blockchain solution and quantifies energy savings when deploying the system on traditional computers and embedded Single-Board Computers (SBCs). To illustrate such savings, it is proposed a solution for tackling the problem of academic certificate forgery, which has a significant cost to society, since it harms the trustworthiness of certificates and academic institutions. The proposed solution is aimed at recording and verifying academic records (ARs) through a decentralized application (DApp) that is supported by a smart contract deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The application stores the raw data (i.e., the data that are not managed by the blockchain) on a decentralized storage system based on Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed solution, it is evaluated in terms of performance (transaction latency and throughput) and efficiency (CPU usage and energy consumption), comparing the results obtained with a traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol and the new Proof-of-Authority (PoA) protocol. The results shown in this paper indicate that the latter is clearly greener and demands less CPU load. Moreover, this article compares the performance of a traditional computer and two SBCs (a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Orange Pi One), showing that is possible to make use of the latter low-power devices to implement blockchain nodes for proposed DApp, but at the cost of higher response latency that varies greatly depending on the used SBCs [...] |

This innovation leverages blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Extended Reality (XR) and advanced technologies to create immersive and interconnected digital environments that mirror the real world. This article delves into the Metaverse of Everything (MoE), a platform that fuses the Metaverse concept with the Internet of Everything (IoE), an advanced version of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects not only physical devices but also people, data and processes within a networked environment. Thus, the MoE integrates generated data and virtual entities, creating an extensive network of interconnected components. This article seeks to advance current MoE, examining decentralization and the application of Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) for interactions with surrounding IoT devices and IoE entities. Moreover, it outlines the main challenges to guide researchers and businesses towards building a future cyber-resilient opportunistic MoE. |

Fernández-Caramés et.al.|[2410.20581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20581)| Although Blockchain has been successfully used in many different fields and applications, it has been traditionally regarded as an energy-intensive technology, essentially due to the past use of inefficient consensus algorithms that prioritized security over sustainability. However, in the last years, thanks to the significant progress made on key blockchain components, their energy consumption can be decreased noticeably. To achieve this objective, this article analyzes the main components of blockchains and explores strategies to reduce their energy consumption. In this way, this article delves into each component of a blockchain system, including consensus mechanisms, network architecture, data storage and validation, smart contract execution, mining and block creation, and outlines specific strategies to decrease their energy consumption. For such a purpose, consensus mechanisms are compared, recommendations for reducing network communications energy consumption are provided, techniques for data storage and validation are suggested and diverse optimizations are proposed both for software and hardware components. Moreover, the main challenges and limitations of reducing power consumption in blockchain systems are analyzed. As a consequence, this article provides a guideline for the future researchers and developers who aim to develop the next generation of Green Blockchain solutions. |

Maintaining this infrastructure involves multiple partners working together to ensure safe, efficient upkeep that meets technical and safety standards, with timely materials and budget adherence. Traditionally, these requirements are managed on paper, with each contract step checked manually. Smart contracts, based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, offer a new approach. Distributed ledgers facilitate secure, transparent transactions, enabling decentralized agreements where contract terms automatically execute when conditions are met. Beyond financial transactions, blockchains can track complex agreements, recording each stage of contract fulfillment between multiple parties. A smart contract is a set of coded rules stored on the blockchain that automatically executes each term upon meeting specified conditions. In infrastructure maintenance, this enables end-to-end automation-from contractor assignment to maintenance completion. Using an immutable, decentralized record, contract terms and statuses are transparent to all parties, enhancing trust and efficiency. Creating smart contracts for infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows to foresee all requirements and liabilities. This workflow includes continuous infrastructure monitoring through a dynamic, data-driven maintenance model that triggers necessary actions. Modern process mining can develop a resilient Maintenance Process Model, helping Operations Management to define contract terms, including asset allocation, logistics, materials, and skill requirements. Automation and reliable data quality across the procedural chain are essential, supported by IoT sensors, big data analytics, predictive maintenance, intelligent logistics, and asset management. |

Unlike traditional FL, our framework enables secure, decentralized authentication and encryption directly on IoT devices using DABE, allowing sensitive data to remain locally encrypted. Homomorphic Encryption permits computations on encrypted data, and SMPC ensures privacy in collaborative computations, while Blockchain technology provides transparent, immutable record-keeping for all transactions and model updates. Local model weights are encrypted and transmitted to fog layers for aggregation using HE and SMPC, then iteratively refined by the central server using differential privacy to safeguard against data leakage. This secure, privacy-preserving FL framework delivers a robust solution for efficient model training and real-time analytics across distributed IoT devices, offering significant advancements in secure decentralized learning for IoT applications. |

While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation. |

Zhu et.al.|[2410.19107](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19107)| We empirically study liquidity and market depth on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), identifying factors at the blockchain, token pair, and pool levels that predict future effective spreads for fixed trade sizes on Uniswap v3 pools. Introducing the v2 counterfactual spread metric, a novel criterion that assesses the degree of liquidity concentration in pools using the ``concentrated liquidity'' mechanism, we decompose the effect of each factor on market depth into two channels: total value locked (TVL) and concentration. We further explore how external liquidity from competing DEXs and fillers with private inventory on DEX aggregators influence market depth. We find, for moderately-sized swaps, that (i) gas prices, returns, and volatility affect spreads primarily through concentration, (ii) internalization of swaps by private liquidity sources affects spreads primarily through TVL, and (iii) fee revenue, markout, and DEX competition affect spreads through both channels. |
|**2024-10-24**|**Quantifying the Value of Revert Protection**|Brian Z. Zhu et.al.|[2410.19106](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19106)| Revert protection is a feature provided by some blockchain platforms that prevents users from incurring fees for failed transactions. This paper explores the economic implications and benefits of revert protection, in the context of priority auctions and maximal extractable value (MEV). We develop an equilibrium game theoretic model that captures the behavior of users (MEV searchers) bidding to have their transaction included ahead of others, in an environment where only a single transaction will succeed in realizing the common value of an opportunity, and in settings both with and without revert protection. Our model applies to a broad range of settings, including Layer 1 (L1) blockchains (e.g., Ethereum mainnet) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, and auctions such as ``bundle auctions'' (on L1s) or priority ordering auctions (on L2s).   We establish that, in the absence of revert protection, users will employ randomized strategies to mitigate the impact of paying for failed transactions. This will ultimately result in less auction revenue, despite the fact that failed transactions still pay fees. Our results quantify in closed form how revert protection enhances auction revenue, and also improves market efficiency and provides for more efficient use of blockspace, as a function of the underlying parameters (the value of the MEV opportunity, the base fee, the revert penalties, and the number of participating agents). |
|**2024-10-24**|**RediSwap: MEV Redistribution Mechanism for CFMMs**|Mengqian Zhang et.al.|[2410.18434](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18434)| Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to decentralized finance, offering continuous liquidity and enabling intermediary-free trading on blockchains. However, participants in AMMs are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation. Users face threats such as front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks, while liquidity providers (LPs) incur the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR).   In this paper, we introduce RediSwap, a novel AMM designed to capture MEV at the application level and refund it fairly among users and liquidity providers. At its core, RediSwap features an MEV-redistribution mechanism that manages arbitrage opportunities within the AMM pool. We formalize the mechanism design problem and the desired game-theoretical properties. A central insight underpinning our mechanism is the interpretation of the maximal MEV value as the sum of LVR and individual user losses. We prove that our mechanism is incentive-compatible and Sybil-proof, and demonstrate that it is easy for arbitrageurs to participate.   We empirically compared RediSwap with existing solutions by replaying historical AMM trades. Our results suggest that RediSwap can achieve better execution than UniswapX in 89% of trades and reduce LPs' loss to under 0.5% of the original LVR in most cases. |
|**2024-10-23**|**Enhancing Enterprise Security with Zero Trust Architecture**|Mahmud Hasan et.al.|[2410.18291](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18291)| Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) represents a transformative approach to modern cybersecurity, directly addressing the shortcomings of traditional perimeter-based security models. With the rise of cloud computing, remote work, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, perimeter defenses have proven ineffective at mitigating risks, particularly those involving insider threats and lateral movement within networks. ZTA shifts the security paradigm by assuming that no user, device, or system can be trusted by default, requiring continuous verification and the enforcement of least privilege access for all entities. This paper explores the key components of ZTA, such as identity and access management (IAM), micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, and behavioral analytics, and evaluates their effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities across diverse sectors, including finance, healthcare, and technology. Through case studies and industry reports, the advantages of ZTA in mitigating insider threats and minimizing attack surfaces are discussed. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges faced during ZTA implementation, such as scalability, integration complexity, and costs, while providing best practices for overcoming these obstacles. Lastly, future research directions focusing on emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and their integration into ZTA are examined to enhance its capabilities further. |

Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausted, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America and Asia) while without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaption to make it meet with the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile rewards honest participation and penalize malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy preserved. Its prediction accuracy is much better than the models trained from limited personal data and is similar to, and even slightly better than, the results from a centralized dataset. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity. |

To increase code security, many tools can now spot most known vulnerabilities $-$ at the cost of production efficiency. Recent studies show false-positive ratios over 99% in state-of-the-art technologies: this makes them impractical for use in industry and have raised questions on the direction of academic research. In this work we show how integrating and extending current analyses is not only feasible, but also a next logical step in smart-contract security. We propose light-weight static checks on the morphology and dynamics of Solidity code, stemming from a developer-centric notion of vulnerability, that we use to verify the output of other tools, flag potential false alarms, and suggest verifications. Besides technical details we implemented an open-source prototype. For three top-10 vulnerabilities it flags 324 warnings of other tools as false-positives, in 60 verified de-duplicated smart contracts selected from the blockchain by the presence of true (and false) vulnerabilities. This amounts to a 92%- to 100%-reduction in the number of false-positives for these vulnerabilities. |
|**2024-10-21**|**AdChain: Decentralized Header Bidding**|Behkish Nassirzadeh et.al.|[2410.16141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16141)| Due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries without trusted parties, lack of proper regulations, and a complicated supply chain, ad impression discrepancy affects online advertising. This issue causes up to $82 billion annual revenue loss for honest parties. The loss can be significantly reduced with a precise and trusted decentralized mechanism. This paper presents AdChain, a decentralized, distributed, and verifiable solution that detects and minimizes online advertisement impression discrepancies. AdChain establishes trust by employing multiple independent agents to receive and record log-level data, along with a consensus protocol to validate each ad data. AdChain is scalable, efficient, and compatible with the current infrastructure. Our experimental evaluation, using over half a million ad data points, identifies system parameters that achieve 98% accuracy, reducing the ad discrepancy rate from 20% to 2%. Our cost analysis shows that active nodes on AdChain can generate profits comparable to miners on major blockchain networks like Bitcoin. |
|**2024-10-21**|**Efficient and Universally Accessible Cross-Chain Options without Upfront Holder Collateral**|Zifan Peng et.al.|[2410.15724](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724)| Options are fundamental to blockchain-based financial markets, offering essential tools for risk management and price speculation, which enhance liquidity, flexibility, and market efficiency in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the growing interest in options for blockchain-resident assets, such as cryptocurrencies, current option mechanisms face significant challenges, including limited asset support, high trading delays, and the requirement for option holders to provide upfront collateral.   In this paper, we present a protocol that addresses the aforementioned issues by facilitating efficient and universally accessible option trading without requiring holders to post collateral when establishing options. Our protocol's universality allows for cross-chain options involving nearly $\textit{any}$ assets on $\textit{any}$ two different blockchains, provided the chains' programming languages can enforce and execute the necessary contract logic. A key innovation in our approach is the use of Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures (DAPS), which significantly reduces trading latency. Additionally, by introducing a guarantee from the option writer, our protocol removes the need of upfront collateral from holders. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme reduces option transfer latency to less than half of that in existing methods. Rigorous security analysis proves that our protocol achieves secure option trading, even when facing adversarial behaviors. |

Leveraging Blockchain technology in IoT applications advances reliability and transparency in near-real-time insight extraction processes. However, it raises significant concerns regarding data privacy. Existing privacy-preserving approaches often rely on Smart Contracts for automation and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for privacy. However, apart from being inflexible in adopting system changes while effectively protecting data confidentiality, these approaches introduce significant computational expenses and overheads that make them impractical for dynamic supply chain environments. To address these challenges, we propose ZK-DPPS, a framework that ensures zero-knowledge communications without the need for traditional ZKPs. In ZK-DPPS, privacy is preserved through a combination of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for computations and Secure Multi-Party Computations (SMPC) for key reconstruction. To ensure that the raw data remains private throughout the entire process, we use FHE to execute computations directly on encrypted data. The "zero-knowledge" aspect of ZK-DPPS refers to the system's ability to process and share data insights without exposing sensitive information, thus offering a practical and efficient alternative to ZKP-based methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of ZK-DPPS through a simulated supply chain scenario, showcasing its ability to tackle the dual challenges of privacy preservation and computational trust in decentralised environments. |
|**2024-10-20**|**MAD: Move AI Decompiler to Improve Transparency and Auditability on Non-Open-Source Blockchain Smart Contract**|Eason Chen et.al.|[2410.15275](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15275)| Web3 aims to enhance user control over data and assets, but this vision is challenged by non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code.   Our evaluation shows that MAD produces logically correct code that successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 66.7% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, in a user study involving 12 developers, MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, simplifying the process of smart contract logic comprehension and auditing. Despite some limitations, such as occasional hallucinations and compile errors, MAD still provides significant improvements over traditional decompilers.   MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering trust and accountability. Additionally, MAD's approach could potentially extend to other smart contract languages, like Solidity, promoting transparency across various blockchains. |

The study investigates the major components of blockchain technology such as decentralised databases, permanent records of transactions and transactional clauses executed via codes of programs and their impacts on automated systems and real-time tracking of audits. The results show a 30% decrease in booking variations together with greater data synchronization as a result of consensus processes and resistant data formations. The approach to the implementation of a blockchain technology for the purpose of this paper includes many APIs for the automatic multi-faceted record-keeping system including the smart contract execution and controllable end-users approach. Smart contracts organized the processes improving the cycle times by 40% on the average while guaranteeing no breach of agreements. In addition to this, the architecture of the system has no single point failure with over 98% reliability while measures taken to improve security have led to 85% of the customers expressing trust in the services provided. In summation, the results suggest that reservations in the airline sector stand a chance of being redefined with blockchain through savoring the benefits of a single source of truth while attempting to resolve this intrinsic problem of overcomplexity. Although the system improves the experience of customers and the level of operational transparency, issues concerning scalability and regulatory adherence. This research is also a stepping stone for further studies that are intended to address these challenges and more applicable to the airline industry. |
|**2024-10-18**|**Safeguarding Blockchain Ecosystem: Understanding and Detecting Attack Transactions on Cross-chain Bridges**|Jiajing Wu et.al.|[2410.14493](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14493)| Cross-chain bridges are essential decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks. Unlike regular DApps, the functionality of cross-chain bridges relies on the collaboration of information both on and off the chain, which exposes them to a wider risk of attacks. According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain bridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion dollars since 2021. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on cross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of cross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred between June 2021 and September 2024. Our analysis reveal that attacks against cross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do not. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal transactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential attack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity of related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain business logic, and propose the BridgeGuard tool. Specifically, BridgeGuard models cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a two-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to identify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple experiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal cross-chain transactions. The results show that BridgeGuard's reported recall score is 36.32\% higher than that of state-of-the-art tools and can detect unknown attack transactions. |

|**2024-10-17**|**Optimal MEV Extraction Using Absolute Commitments**|Daji Landis et.al.|[2410.13624](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13624)| We propose a new, more potent attack on decentralized exchanges. This attack leverages absolute commitments, which are commitments that can condition on the strategies made by other agents. This attack allows an adversary to charge monopoly prices by committing to undercut those other miners that refuse to charge an even higher fee. This allows the miner to extract the maximum possible price from the user, potentially through side channels that evade the inefficiencies and fees usually incurred. This is considerably more efficient than the prevailing strategy of `sandwich attacks', wherein the adversary induces and profits from fluctuations in the market price to the detriment of users. The attack we propose can, in principle, be realized by the irrevocable and self-executing nature of smart contracts, which are readily available on many major blockchains. Thus, the attack could potentially be used against a decentralized exchange and could drastically reduce the utility of the affected exchange. |

Traditional methods of verification and certification are often inadequate due to the fast-past and dynamic development practices common in cloud computing. This paper introduces Advocate, a novel agent-based system designed to generate verifiable evidence of cloud-native application operations. By integrating with existing infrastructure tools, such as Kubernetes and distributed tracing systems, Advocate captures, authenticates, and stores evidence trails in a tamper-resistant manner. This approach not only supports the auditing process but also allows for privacy-preserving evidence aggregation. Advocate's extensible architecture facilitates its deployment in diverse environments, enabling the verification and adherence to policies and enhance trust in cloud services. |

This paper explores the design of transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) for ZK-Rollups, focusing on how key components like sequencing, data availability~(DA), and ZK proving interact to influence cost structures. We outline the properties that a suitable TFM should possess, such as incentive compatibility and net profitability. In addition, we propose alternatives for TFMs, discuss trade-offs, and highlight open questions that require further investigation in the context of ZK-Rollups. |
|**2024-10-16**|**Future of Algorithmic Organization: Large-Scale Analysis of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**|Tanusree Sharma et.al.|[2410.13095](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13095)| Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) resemble early online communities, particularly those centered around open-source projects, and present a potential empirical framework for complex social-computing systems by encoding governance rules within "smart contracts" on the blockchain. A key function of a DAO is collective decision-making, typically carried out through a series of proposals where members vote on organizational events using governance tokens, signifying relative influence within the DAO. In just a few years, the deployment of DAOs surged with a total treasury of $24.5 billion and 11.1M governance token holders collectively managing decisions across over 13,000 DAOs as of 2024. In this study, we examine the operational dynamics of 100 DAOs, like pleasrdao, lexdao, lootdao, optimism collective, uniswap, etc. With large-scale empirical analysis of a diverse set of DAO categories and smart contracts and by leveraging on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data, we examine factors such as voting power, participation, and DAO characteristics dictating the level of decentralization, thus, the efficiency of management structures. As such, our study highlights that increased grassroots participation correlates with higher decentralization in a DAO, and lower variance in voting power within a DAO correlates with a higher level of decentralization, as consistently measured by Gini metrics. These insights closely align with key topics in political science, such as the allocation of power in decision-making and the effects of various governance models. We conclude by discussing the implications for researchers, and practitioners, emphasizing how these factors can inform the design of democratic governance systems in emerging applications that require active engagement from stakeholders in decision-making. |
|**2024-10-16**|**SEMSO: A Secure and Efficient Multi-Data Source Blockchain Oracle**|Youquan Xian et.al.|[2410.12540](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12540)| In recent years, blockchain oracle, as the key link between blockchain and real-world data interaction, has greatly expanded the application scope of blockchain. In particular, the emergence of the Multi-Data Source (MDS) oracle has greatly improved the reliability of the oracle in the case of untrustworthy data sources. However, the current MDS oracle scheme requires nodes to obtain data redundantly from multiple data sources to guarantee data reliability, which greatly increases the resource overhead and response time of the system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Secure and Efficient Multi-data Source Oracle framework (SEMSO), which nodes only need to access one data source to ensure the reliability of final data. First, we design a new off-chain data aggregation protocol TBLS, to guarantee data source diversity and reliability at low cost. Second, according to the rational man assumption, the data source selection task of nodes is modeled and solved based on the Bayesian game under incomplete information to maximize the node's revenue while improving the success rate of TBLS aggregation and system response speed. Security analysis verifies the reliability of the proposed scheme, and experiments show that under the same environmental assumptions, SEMSO takes into account data diversity while reducing the response time by 23.5\%. |

During this process, transactions are efficiently processed off the main chain. Besides, both the transaction data and the zero-knowledge proofs of transaction executions are reserved on the main chain, ensuring the availability of transaction data as well as the correctness and verifiability of transaction executions. Hence, any bugs that cause the transaction finalization failure are crucial, as they impair the usability of these protocols and the scalability of blockchains.   In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on finalization failure bugs in zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols, and define two kinds of such bugs. Besides, we design fAmulet, the first tool to detect finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, a prominent zero-knowledge layer 2 protocol, by leveraging fuzzing testing. To trigger finalization failure bugs effectively, we introduce a finalization behavior model to guide our transaction fuzzer to generate and mutate transactions for inducing diverse behaviors across each component (e.g., Sequencer) in the finalization process. Moreover, we define bug oracles according to the distinct bug definitions to accurately detect bugs. Through our evaluation, fAmulet can uncover twelve zero-day finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, and cover at least 20.8% more branches than baselines. Furthermore, through our preliminary study, fAmulet uncovers a zero-day finalization failure bug in Scroll zkRollup, highlighting the generality of fAmulet to be applied to other zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols. At the time of writing, all our uncovered bugs have been confirmed and fixed by Polygon zkRollup and Scroll zkRollup teams. |

PoTS shifts the consensus mechanism from an individual competition model to a collaborative team-based approach. Participants are organized into groups, with each group collaboratively working to solve cryptographic puzzles required to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This collaborative approach significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the network while maintaining high levels of security and decentralization. Our analysis shows that PoTS can reduce energy consumption by a factor of 1/N, where N is the number of participants in each group, compared to PoW. Furthermore, PoTS maintains a fair and equitable reward distribution among participants, ensuring continued engagement and network integrity. The paper also discusses the scalability, security implications, and potential challenges of adopting PoTS, positioning it as a promising alternative for sustainable blockchain technology. |

In web-based applications, clients are liberated from traditional fixed network topologies, enabling the establishment of arbitrary peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. While this flexibility is highly promising, it introduces a fundamental challenge: the optimal selection of neighbors to ensure effective collaboration. To address this, we introduce WPFed, a fully decentralized, web-based learning framework designed to enable globally optimal neighbor selection. WPFed employs a dynamic communication graph and a weighted neighbor selection mechanism. By assessing inter-client similarity through Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and evaluating model quality based on peer rankings, WPFed enables clients to identify personalized optimal neighbors on a global scale while preserving data privacy. To enhance security and deter malicious behavior, WPFed integrates verification mechanisms for both LSH codes and performance rankings, leveraging blockchain-driven announcements to ensure transparency and verifiability. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that WPFed significantly improves learning outcomes and system robustness compared to traditional federated learning methods. Our findings highlight WPFed's potential to facilitate effective and secure decentralized collaborative learning across diverse and interconnected web environments. |
|**2024-10-14**|**Functional Adaptor Signatures: Beyond All-or-Nothing Blockchain-based Payments**|Nikhil Vanjani et.al.|[2410.11134](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11134)| In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data $x$, like patient records, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of a function $f$ on $x$, solutions in trustless environments like blockchain fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions using tools such as adaptor signatures. The former offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns $f(x)$ upon payment. However, this approach is inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller's data, and is incompatible with blockchains such as bitcoin. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an "all-or-nothing" guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts $x$ and does not support extracting $f(x)$. In this work, we bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales while offering all the above properties like adaptor signatures.   Towards this, we propose functional adaptor signatures (FAS), a novel cryptographic primitive and show how it can be used to enable functional sales. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called witness privacy to capture seller's privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond $f(x)$ . We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, witness hiding, witness indistinguishability, and zero-knowledge.   We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions based on groups of prime-order and lattices, that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption and adaptor signatures. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, all operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware. |

This makes effective mechanisms for transaction inclusion and ordering, and thereby the extraction of MEV, a key aspect of blockchain design. Beyond traditional approaches such as ordering in a first-come-first-serve manner or using priority fees, a recent proposal suggests auctioning off a time advantage for transaction inclusion. In this paper, we investigate this time advantage mechanism, focusing specifically on arbitrage opportunities on Automated Market Makers (AMMs), one of the largest sources of MEV today. We analyze the optimal strategy for a time-advantaged arbitrageur and compare the profits generated by various MEV extraction methods. Finally, we explore how AMMs can be adapted in the time advantage setting to capture a portion of the MEV. |

Previous works introduced viable blockchain sealed-bid auction protocols, leveraging timed commitments for bid encryption. However, a crucial challenge remains unresolved in these works: Who should bear the cost of decrypting these timed commitments?   This work introduces a timed commitment outsourcing market as a solution to the aforementioned challenge. We first introduce an aggregation scheme for timed commitments, which combines all bidders' timed commitments into one while ensuring security and correctness and allowing a varying number of bidders. Next, we remodel the utility of auctioneers and timed commitment solvers, developing a new timed commitment competition mechanism and combining it with the sealed-bid auction to form a two-sided market. The protocol includes bid commitment collection, timed commitment solving, and payment. Through game-theoretical analysis, we prove that our protocol satisfies Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) for bidders, Bayesian Incentive Compatibility (BIC) for solvers, and achieves optimal revenue for the auctioneer among a large class of mechanisms. Finally, we prove that no mechanism can achieve positive expected revenue for the auctioneer while satisfying DSIC and Individual Rationality (IR) for both bidders and solvers. |

This centralization often results in siloed data ecosystems, where interoperability issues and opaque data handling practices compromise both the utility and trustworthiness of IoT applications. To address these issues, we introduce ZONIA (Zero-trust Oracle Network for IoT Applications), a novel blockchain oracle system designed to enhance data integrity and decentralization in IoT environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on Trusted Execution Environments and centralized data sources, ZONIA utilizes a decentralized, zero-trust model that allows for anonymous participation and integrates multiple data sources to ensure fairness and reliability. This paper outlines ZONIA's architecture, which supports semantic and geospatial queries, details its data reliability mechanisms, and presents a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating its scalability and resilience against data falsification and collusion attacks. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate ZONIA's scalability, showcasing its feasibility to handle an increasing number of nodes in the system under different system conditions and workloads. Furthermore, the implemented reputation mechanism significantly enhances data accuracy, maintaining high reliability even when 40\% of nodes exhibit malicious behavior. |

However, Liquidity Providers (LPs) are lagging behind. Our empirical results show that AMM liquidity pools on Ethereum are oversubscribed compared to their counterparties on L2s and often deliver lower returns than staking ETH. LPs would receive higher rewards by reallocating part of the liquidity to AMMs on L2s, or staking. By employing Lagrangian optimization, we find the optimal liquidity allocation strategy that maximizes LPs rewards. Moreover, we show that the returns from liquidity provisions converge to the staking rate, and in a perfect equilibrium, liquidity provisions to any AMM should provide returns equal to staking rewards. |

The developments in the DEXs sector began with the implementation of an automated market maker (AMM) system using a simple math formula by Uniswap V1 in 2018. Absorbing significant funding and the attention of web3 enthusiasts, DEXs have seen numerous advancements in their evolution. A notable recent advancement is the introduction of hooks in Uniswap v4, which allows users to take advantage of a wide range of plugin-like features with liquidity pools. This paper provides a comprehensive classification and comparative analyses of prominent DEX protocols, namely Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer, in addition to investigating other protocols' noteworthy aspects. The evaluation framework encompasses mechanisms, components, mathematical formulations, and the performance of liquidity pools. The goals are to elucidate the strengths and limitations of different AMM models, highlight emerging concepts in DEX development, outline current challenges, and differentiate optimal models for specific applications. The results and comparative insights can be a reference for web3 developers, blockchain researchers, traders, and regulatory parties. |

We present a model considering capacity constraints, user valuations, and delay costs in a multi-queue system with an aggregate capacity constraint due to global consensus. We show that revenue maximization tends to allocate capacity to the highest-paying queue, while welfare maximization generally serves all queues. Optimal relative pricing of different queues depends on factors such as market size, demand elasticity, and the balance between local and global congestion. Our results have implications for evolving blockchain architectures, including parallel execution, DAG-based systems, and multiple concurrent proposers, and can help design more efficient TEMs. |

However, efficient set membership proofs remain a critical challenge, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel OR-aggregation approach for zero-knowledge set membership proofs, tailored specifically for blockchain-based sensor networks. We provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation, detailed protocol specification, and rigorous security analysis. Our implementation incorporates optimization techniques for resource-constrained devices and strategies for integration with prominent blockchain platforms. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods, particularly for large-scale deployments.

Concurrently, blockchain technology has enhanced the security of medical institutions. However, these institutions often function as isolated data silos, limiting the potential value of PHRs. As the demand for data sharing between hospitals on different blockchains grows, addressing the challenge of cross-chain data sharing becomes crucial. When sharing PHRs across blockchains, the limited storage and computational capabilities of medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices complicate the storage of large volumes of PHRs and the handling of complex calculations. Additionally, varying blockchain cryptosystems and the risk of internal attacks further complicate the cross-chain sharing of PHRs. This paper proposes a scheme for sharing PHRs across heterogeneous and interoperable blockchains. Medical IoT devices can encrypt and store real-time PHRs in an InterPlanetary File System, requiring only simple operations for data sharing. An enhanced proxy re-encryption(PRE) algorithm addresses the differences in blockchain cryptosystems. Multi-dimensional analysis demonstrates that this scheme offers robust security and excellent performance. |

Obelia implements a two-tier validator system. A core group of high-stake validators that propose blocks as in current protocols and a larger group of lower-stake auxiliary validators that occasionally author blocks. Obelia incentivizes auxiliary validators to assist recovering core validators and integrates seamlessly with existing protocols. We show that Obelia does not introduce visible overhead compared to the original protocol, even when scaling to hundreds of validators, or when a large number of auxiliary validators are unreliable. |

We conducted a comprehensive literature review, supplemented by case study analyses and research paper reviews, to understand the scope and implications of blockchain about intellectual property rights. Our study demonstrates how applying blockchain technology for IPR could revolutionize transparency, security, and operational efficiency. It also identifies the primary challenges and openings in this area. We provide an extensive framework for integrating blockchain technology with intellectual property rights and other technical components (some of which already exist or are resolved by blockchain; some might need attention), drawing on current research and best practices. This framework has the potential to give a new perspective in a structured manner for the intellectual property landscape by providing 360-degree coverage across different layers of operation. |

Our design leverages the unused or under-used computing and communication resources of LEO satellites that are orbiting over uninhabited parts of the earth, like the oceans. We show how blockchain-backed distributed transactions can be run efficiently on this architecture to offer smart contract services. A key aspect of the proposed architecture that sets it apart from other blockchain systems is that migration of the ledger is not done solely to recover from failures. Rather, migration is also performed periodically and continuously as the satellites circle around in their orbits and enter and leave the blockchain service area. We show in simulations how message and blockchain processing overhead can be contained using different sizes of dynamic geo-aware service areas. |
|**2024-10-10**|**Revisiting the Primitives of Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Aadityan Ganesh et.al.|[2410.07566](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07566)| Transaction Fee Mechanism Design studies auctions run by untrusted miners for transaction inclusion in a blockchain. Under previously-considered desiderata, an auction is considered `good' if, informally-speaking, each party (i.e., the miner, the users, and coalitions of both miners and users) has no incentive to deviate from the fixed and pre-determined protocol.   In this paper, we propose a novel desideratum for transaction fee mechanisms. We say that a TFM is off-chain influence proof when the miner cannot achieve additional revenue by running a separate auction off-chain. While the previously-highlighted EIP-1559 is the gold-standard according to prior desiderata, we show that it does not satisfy off-chain influence proofness. Intuitively, this holds because a Bayesian revenue-maximizing miner can strictly increase profits by persuasively threatening to censor any bids that do not transfer a tip directly to the miner off-chain.   On the other hand, we reconsider the Cryptographic (multi-party computation assisted) Second Price Auction mechanism, which is technically not `simple for miners' according to previous desiderata (since miners may wish to set a reserve by fabricating bids). We show that, in a slightly different model where the miner is allowed to set the reserve directly, this auction satisfies simplicity for users and miners, and off-chain influence proofness.   Finally, we prove a strong impossibility result: no mechanism satisfies all previously-considered properties along with off-chain influence proofness, even with unlimited supply, and even after soliciting input from the miner. |

By integrating game-theoretic models with machine learning techniques and the principles of blockchain technology, we analyze the role of strategic information disclosure in ad auctions. Our findings demonstrate that even in environments with inherent transparency, ad platforms can design signals to affect advertisers' beliefs and bidding strategies. A detailed case study illustrates how machine learning can predict advertiser responses to different signals, leading to optimized signaling strategies that increase expected revenue. The study contributes to the literature by extending Bayesian persuasion models to transparent systems and providing practical insights for auction design in the digital advertising industry. |

The consumption of halal food product is just not among the Muslims but also among non-Muslims, due to the purity of the halal food products. However, there are several challenges that are faced by the halal food consumers. The challenges raise a doubt among the halal food consumers about the authenticity of the product being halal. Therefore, a solution that can address these issues and can establish trust between consumers and producers. Blockchain technology can provide a distributed ledger of an immutable record of the information. Artificial intelligence supports developing a solution for pattern identification. The proposed research utilizes blockchain an artificial intelligence-based system for developing a system that ensure the authenticity of the halal food products by providing the traceability related to all the operations and processes of the supply chain and sourcing the raw material. The proposed system has been tested with a local supermarket. The results and tests of the developed solution seemed effective and the testers expressed interest in real-world implementation of the proposed system. |

Complementing this initiative, the Pacte ESRI 2030 strategy, launched in 2023, seeks to transform the higher education, research, and innovation sectors by integrating state-of-the-art digital technologies. In alignment with these national strategies, this paper introduces BlockMEDC, a blockchain-based system for securing and managing Moroccan educational digital certificates. Leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and the InterPlanetary File System, BlockMEDC automates the issuance, management, and verification of academic credentials across Moroccan universities. The proposed system addresses key issues such as document authenticity, manual verification, and lack of interoperability, delivering a secure, transparent, and cost-effective solution that aligns with Morocco's digital transformation goals for the education sector. |

Consequently, ensuring reliable offloading without QoS violations is challenging in distributed and unreliable edge environments. However, current edge offloading solutions are either centralized or do not adequately address challenges in distributed environments. We propose FRESCO, a fast and reliable edge offloading framework that utilizes a blockchain-based reputation system, which enhances the reliability of offloading in the distributed edge. The distributed reputation system tracks the historical performance of edge servers, while blockchain through a consensus mechanism ensures that sensitive reputation information is secured against tampering. However, blockchain consensus typically has high latency, and therefore we employ a Hybrid Smart Contract (HSC) that automatically computes and stores reputation securely on-chain (i.e., on the blockchain) while allowing fast offloading decisions off-chain (i.e., outside of blockchain). The offloading decision engine uses a reputation score to derive fast offloading decisions, which are based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). The SMT models edge resource constraints, and QoS deadlines, and can formally guarantee a feasible solution that is valuable for latency-sensitive applications that require high reliability. With a combination of on-chain HSC reputation state management and an off-chain SMT decision engine, FRESCO offloads tasks to reliable servers without being hindered by blockchain consensus. We evaluate FRESCO against real availability traces and simulated applications. FRESCO reduces response time by up to 7.86 times and saves energy by up to 5.4% compared to all baselines while minimizing QoS violations to 0.4% and achieving an average decision time of 5.05 milliseconds. |

This study examines how blockchain technology in the form of blockLAW can be applicable to investigate its effects on legal automation, cybersecurity, and ethical concerns. The decentralized ledger and unchangeable characteristics of Blockchain provide opportunities to simplify legal procedures, automate contract execution with smart contracts, and improve transparency in legal transactions. Blockchain is seen as a crucial instrument for updating legal processes while maintaining ethical standards, tackling issues like scalability, regulatory adherence, and ethical dilemmas such as privacy and fairness. The study examines recent developments and evaluates blockchain impact on legal structures, offering perspectives on its potential to enhance legal procedures and guarantee transparency in legal systems. It further emphasizes blockchain ability to redefine how legal professionals handle and protect sensitive information, leading to stronger, more effective, and reliable legal procedures. We have also discussed the technological considerations when it comes to blockchain integration into legal systems like integration planning, implementation strategies, innovations, advancements, trends with Blockchain Integration Framework for legal systems. |

Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs. |

This system establishes a marketplace where bushfire management authorities, as data consumers, access critical information from drone operators, who serve as data providers. The framework employs local differential privacy to safeguard the privacy of data providers from all system entities, ensuring compliance with privacy standards. Additionally, a blockchain-based solution facilitates fair data and fee exchanges while maintaining immutable records for enhanced accountability. Validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, the framework's scalability and adaptability make it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications in bushfire management. |

This paper investigates the integration of blockchain technology in healthcare, focusing on its potential to revolutionize Electronic Health Records (EHR) management and data sharing. By leveraging Ethereum-based blockchain implementations and smart contracts, we propose a novel system that empowers patients to securely store and manage their medical data. Our research addresses critical challenges in implementing blockchain in healthcare, including scalability, user privacy, and regulatory compliance. We propose a solution that combines digital signatures, Role-Based Access Control, and a multi-layered architecture to enhance security and ensure controlled access. The system's key functions, including user registration, data append, and data retrieval, are facilitated through smart contracts, providing a secure and efficient mechanism for managing health information. To validate our approach, we developed a decentralized application (dApp) that demonstrates the practical implementation of our blockchain-based healthcare solution. The dApp incorporates user-friendly interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators, showcasing the system's potential to streamline healthcare processes while maintaining data security and integrity. Additionally, we conducted a survey to gain insights into the perceived benefits and challenges of blockchain adoption in healthcare.

Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data. |

While the literature features a number of light client instantiations, most light client protocols optimize for long offline phases and implicitly assume that the block headers to be verified are signed by highly dynamic validators.   In this paper, we show that (i) most light clients are rarely offline for more than a week, and (ii) validators are unlikely to drastically change in most permissioned blockchains and in a number of permissionless blockchains, such as Cosmos and Polkadot. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel practical system that optimizes for such realistic assumptions and achieves minimal communication and computational costs for light clients when compared to existing protocols. By means of a prototype implementation of our solution, we show that our protocol achieves a reduction by up to $90$ and $40000\times$ (respectively) in end-to-end latency and up to $1000$ and $10000\times$ (respectively) smaller proof size when compared to two state-of-the-art light client instantiations from the literature. |

While transactions are recorded on the blockchain, there exists a need for a more rapid and scalable method to detect addresses associated with fraudulent activities. We present RiskSEA, a scalable risk scoring system capable of effectively handling the dynamic nature of large-scale blockchain transaction graphs. The risk scoring system, which we implement for Ethereum, consists of 1. a scalable approach to generating node2vec embedding for entire set of addresses to capture the graph topology 2. transaction-based features to capture the transactional behavioral pattern of an address 3. a classifier model to generate risk score for addresses that combines the node2vec embedding and behavioral features. Efficiently generating node2vec embedding for large scale and dynamically evolving blockchain transaction graphs is challenging, we present two novel approaches for generating node2vec embeddings and effectively scaling it to the entire set of blockchain addresses: 1. node2vec embedding propagation and 2. dynamic node2vec embedding. We present a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches. Our experiments show that combining both behavioral and node2vec features boosts the classification performance significantly, and that the dynamic node2vec embeddings perform better than the node2vec propagated embeddings. |

However, several of these bridges have vulnerabilities that have caused 3.2 billion dollars in losses since May 2021. Some studies have revealed the existence of these vulnerabilities, but little quantitative research is available, and there are no safeguard mechanisms to protect bridges from such attacks. We propose XChainWatcher(Cross-Chain Watcher), the first mechanism for monitoring bridges and detecting attacks against them in real time. XChainWatcher relies on a cross-chain model powered by a Datalog engine, designed to be pluggable into any cross-chain bridge. Analyzing data from the Ronin and Nomad bridges, we successfully identified the attacks that led to losses of \ $611M and \$190M (USD), respectively. XChainWatcher uncovers not only successful attacks but also reveals unintended behavior, such as 37 cross-chain transactions (cctx) that these bridges should not have accepted, failed attempts to exploit Nomad, over \$7.8M locked on one chain but never released on Ethereum, and \$200K lost due to inadequate interaction with bridges. We provide the first open-source dataset of 81,000 cctxs across three blockchains, capturing more than \$ 4.2B in token transfers. |

While the individual exploits in each attack vary, a single design flaw underlies them all: the lack of end-to-end value accounting in cross-chain transactions. In this paper, we empirically analyze 10 million transactions used by key bridges during this period. We show that a simple invariant that balances cross-chain inflows and outflows is compatible with legitimate use, yet precisely identifies every known attack (and several likely attacks) in this data. Further, we show that this approach is not only sufficient for post-hoc audits, but can be implemented in-line in existing bridge designs to provide generic protection against a broad array of bridge vulnerabilities. |

As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in capturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized systems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs, and CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and temporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in particular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and transactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection, transaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be adapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices, revealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows.

However, the dynamic nature of spam and the sophisticated evasion techniques employed by spammers often lead to low accuracy in these models. Traditional machine-learning approaches struggle to keep pace with spammers' constantly evolving tactics, resulting in a persistent challenge to maintain high detection rates. To address this, we propose blockchain-enabled incentivized crowdsourcing as a novel solution to enhance spam detection systems. We create an incentive mechanism for data collection and labeling by leveraging blockchain's decentralized and transparent framework. Contributors are rewarded for accurate labels and penalized for inaccuracies, ensuring high-quality data. A smart contract governs the submission and evaluation process, with participants staking cryptocurrency as collateral to guarantee integrity. Simulations show that incentivized crowdsourcing improves data quality, leading to more effective machine-learning models for spam detection. This approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution to the challenges of traditional methods. |

Here, we present a mathematical theory for a novel blockchain network topology based on fractal N-dimensional simplexes. This Hyper-simplex fractal network folds one-dimensional data blocks into geometric shapes, reflecting both underlying and overlaying network connectivities. Our approach offers near-infinite scalability, accommodating trillions of nodes while maintaining efficiency.   We derive the mathematical foundations for generating and describing these network topologies, proving key properties such as node count, connectivity patterns, and fractal dimension. The resulting structure facilitates a hierarchical consensus mechanism and enables deterministic address mapping for rapid routing. This theoretical framework lays the groundwork for next-generation blockchain architectures, potentially revolutionizing large-scale decentralized systems.

AI-driven models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, CNNs, and LSTM RNNs have achieved over 98\% accuracy in predicting heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), Alzheimer's disease, and lung cancer, using datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI, private institutions, and real-time IoMT sources. However, challenges persist due to variations in data quality, patient demographics, and formats from different hospitals and research sources. The incorporation of IoMT data, which is vast and heterogeneous, adds complexities in ensuring interoperability and security to protect patient privacy. AI models often struggle with overfitting, performing well in controlled environments but less effectively in real-world clinical settings. Moreover, multi-morbidity scenarios especially for rare diseases like dementia, stroke, and cancers remain insufficiently addressed. Future research should focus on data standardization and advanced preprocessing techniques to improve data quality and interoperability. Transfer learning and ensemble methods are crucial for improving model generalizability across clinical settings. Additionally, the exploration of disease interactions and the development of predictive models for chronic illness intersections is needed. Creating standardized frameworks and open-source tools for integrating federated learning, blockchain, and differential privacy into IoMT systems will also ensure robust data privacy and security. |
|**2024-09-30**|**DBNode: A Decentralized Storage System for Big Data Storage in Consortium Blockchains**|Narges Dadkhah et.al.|[2409.20123](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20123)| Storing big data directly on a blockchain poses a substantial burden due to the need to maintain a consistent ledger across all nodes. Numerous studies in decentralized storage systems have been conducted to tackle this particular challenge. Most state-of-the-art research concentrates on developing a general storage system that can accommodate diverse blockchain categories. However, it is essential to recognize the unique attributes of a consortium blockchain, such as data privacy and access control. Beyond ensuring high performance, these specific needs are often overlooked by general storage systems. This paper proposes a decentralized storage system for Hyperledger Fabric, which is a well-known consortium blockchain. First, we employ erasure coding to partition files, subsequently organizing these chunks into a hierarchical structure that fosters efficient and dependable data storage. Second, we design a two-layer hash-slots mechanism and a mirror strategy, enabling high data availability. Third, we design an access control mechanism based on a smart contract to regulate file access. |

Extensive simulations demonstrate that this hash function exhibits strong properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance, which are essential for cryptographic applications. Notably, the estimated number of attempts required for a successful collision attack increases exponentially with the mode counts of the photonic quantum computer, suggesting robust resistance against birthday attacks. We also analyze the sampling cost for physical implementation and discuss potential applications to blockchain technologies, where the inherent quantum nature of the hash computation could provide quantum-resistant security. The high dimensionality of the quantum state space involved in the hashing process poses significant challenges for quantum attacks, indicating a path towards quantum security. Our work lays the foundation for a new paradigm of quantum-resistant hashing with applications in emerging quantum-era information systems. |

Traditional systems often fail to ensure data authenticity and prevent unauthorized alterations, particularly in the evaluation of teachers' professional activities, where demand for transparent and secure assessment mechanisms is increasing. In this context, Blockchain technology offers a novel solution to address these issues. This paper introduces a Blockchain-enhanced framework for the Electronic Platform for Expertise of Content (EPEC), a platform used for reviewing and assessing educational materials. Our approach integrates the Polygon network, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, to securely store and retrieve encrypted reviews, ensuring both privacy and accountability. By leveraging Python, Flask, and Web3.py, we interact with a Solidity-based smart contract to securely link each review to a unique identifier (UID) that connects on-chain data with real-world databases. The system, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and integration through API endpoints. Our implementation demonstrates significant cost savings, with a 98\% reduction in gas fees compared to Ethereum, making it a scalable and cost-effective solution. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to implement Blockchain in educational content verification, offering a practical and secure framework that enhances trust and transparency in the digital education landscape. |
|**2024-09-29**|**Programming on Bitcoin: A Survey of Layer 1 and Layer 2 Technologies in Bitcoin Ecosystem**|Guofu Liao et.al.|[2409.19622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19622)| This paper surveys innovative protocols that enhance the programming functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain, a key part of the "Bitcoin Ecosystem." Bitcoin utilizes the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and a stack-based script language for efficient peer-to-peer payments, but it faces limitations in programming capability and throughput. The 2021 Taproot upgrade introduced the Schnorr signature algorithm and P2TR transaction type, significantly improving Bitcoin's privacy and programming capabilities. This upgrade has led to the development of protocols like Ordinals, Atomicals, and BitVM, which enhance Bitcoin's programming functionality and enrich its ecosystem. We explore the technical aspects of the Taproot upgrade and examine Bitcoin Layer 1 protocols that leverage Taproot's features to program non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into transactions, including Ordinals and Atomicals, along with the fungible token standards BRC-20 and ARC-20.   Additionally, we categorize certain Bitcoin ecosystem protocols as Layer 2 solutions similar to Ethereum's, analyzing their impact on Bitcoin's performance. By analyzing data from the Bitcoin blockchain, we gather metrics on block capacity, miner fees, and the growth of Taproot transactions. Our findings confirm the positive effects of these protocols on Bitcoin's mainnet, bridging gaps in the literature regarding Bitcoin's programming capabilities and ecosystem protocols and providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers. |
|**2024-09-28**|**IM: Optimizing Byzantine Consensus for High-Performance Distributed Networks**|Qingming Zeng et.al.|[2409.19286](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19286)| Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, a crucial component of blockchains, has made significant advancements. However, the efficiency of existing protocols can still be damaged by certain attacks from faulty nodes and network instability. In this paper, we propose a novel Shared Mempool (SMP) protocol, namely IM, that enhances performance under these attacks. Technically, IM organizing microblocks into chains, combined with coding techniques, achieves totality and availability efficiently. IM can be easily integrated into a BFT protocol. We take Fast-HotStuff as an example and obtain the IM-FHS with guarantees of \emph{order keeping}, \emph{bandwidth adaptability} and \emph{over-distribution resistance}. IM-FHS is conducted in a system with up to 256 nodes, and experimental results validate the efficiency of our approach. IM-FHS achieves higher throughput and smaller latency with faulty nodes than Stratus-FHS, the state-of-the-art protocol, and the throughput gain increases as the number of fault nodes. In a system with 100 nodes with 33 faulty nodes, IM-FHS achieves 9 times the throughput of Stratus-FHS while maintaining 1/10 the latency when dealing with maximum resilience against faulty nodes. |

By analyzing user data such as past activities, ratings, and preferences, these systems generate personalized recommendations for products, services, or content, with common applications including online retail, media streaming platforms, and social media. Recommender systems are typically categorized into three types: content-based filtering, which recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in; collaborative filtering, which analyzes the preferences of similar users; and hybrid methods, which combine both approaches to improve accuracy. These systems enhance user experience by reducing information overload and providing personalized suggestions, thus increasing engagement and satisfaction. However, building a scalable recommendation system capable of handling numerous users efficiently is a significant challenge, particularly when considering both performance consistency and user data security, which are emerging research topics. The primary objective of this research is to address these challenges by reducing the processing time in recommendation systems. A multithreaded similarity approach is employed to achieve this, where users are divided into independent threads that run in parallel. This parallelization significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional methods, resulting in a faster, more efficient, and scalable recommendation system that ensures improved performance without compromising user data security. |
|**2024-09-26**|**A Systematisation of Knowledge: Connecting European Digital Identities with Web3**|Ben Biedermann et.al.|[2409.19032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19032)| The terms self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralised identity are often used interchangeably, which results in increasing ambiguity when solutions are being investigated and compared. This article aims to provide a clear distinction between the two concepts in relation to the revised Regulation as Regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework (eIDAS 2.0) by providing a systematisation of knowledge of technological developments that led up to implementation of eIDAS 2.0. Applying an inductive exploratory approach, relevant literature was selected iteratively in waves over a nine months time frame and covers literature between 2005 and 2024. The review found that the decentralised identity sector emerged adjacent to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) paradigm of Open Authentication, whereas SSI denotes the sector's shift towards blockchain-based solutions. In this study, it is shown that the interchangeable use of SSI and decentralised identity coincides with novel protocols over OIDC. While the first part of this paper distinguishes OIDC from decentralised identity, the second part addresses the incompatibility between OIDC under eIDAS 2.0 and Web3. The paper closes by suggesting further research for establishing a digital identity bridge for connecting applications on public-permissionless ledgers with data originating from eIDAS 2.0 and being presented using OIDC. |

This survey addresses the need for a comprehensive review and taxonomy to clarify the differences between blockchain and blockchain-like systems. We propose a reference model with four key layers: data, consensus, execution, and application, and introduce a new taxonomy for better classification. Through a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 44 DLT solutions and 26 consensus mechanisms, we highlight key challenges and offer research directions in the field. |
|**2024-09-27**|**Architecture for Protecting Data Privacy in Decentralized Social Networks**|Quang Cao et.al.|[2409.18360](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18360)| Centralized social networks have experienced a transformative impact on our digital era communication, connection, and information-sharing information. However, it has also raised significant concerns regarding users' privacy and individual rights. In response to these concerns, this paper proposes a novel Decentralized Social Network employing Blockchain technology and Decentralized Storage Networks completed by Access Control Smart Contracts. The initial phase comprises a comprehensive literature review, delving into decentralized social networks, explaining the review methodology, and presenting the resulting findings. Building upon these findings and an analysis of previous research gaps, we propose a novel architecture for decentralized social networks. In conclusion, the principal results highlight the benefit of our decentralized social network to protect user privacy. Moreover, the users have all rights to their posted information following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). |
|**2024-09-26**|**PDFed: Privacy-Preserving and Decentralized Asynchronous Federated Learning for Diffusion Models**|Kar Balan et.al.|[2409.18245](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18245)| We present PDFed, a decentralized, aggregator-free, and asynchronous federated learning protocol for training image diffusion models using a public blockchain. In general, diffusion models are prone to memorization of training data, raising privacy and ethical concerns (e.g., regurgitation of private training data in generated images). Federated learning (FL) offers a partial solution via collaborative model training across distributed nodes that safeguard local data privacy. PDFed proposes a novel sample-based score that measures the novelty and quality of generated samples, incorporating these into a blockchain-based federated learning protocol that we show reduces private data memorization in the collaboratively trained model. In addition, PDFed enables asynchronous collaboration among participants with varying hardware capabilities, facilitating broader participation. The protocol records the provenance of AI models, improving transparency and auditability, while also considering automated incentive and reward mechanisms for participants. PDFed aims to empower artists and creators by protecting the privacy of creative works and enabling decentralized, peer-to-peer collaboration. The protocol positively impacts the creative economy by opening up novel revenue streams and fostering innovative ways for artists to benefit from their contributions to the AI space. |
|**2024-09-26**|**Verifying Randomized Consensus Protocols with Common Coins**|Song Gao et.al.|[2409.17627](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17627)| Randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins are widely used in cloud computing and blockchain platforms. Due to their fundamental role, it is vital to guarantee their correctness. Threshold automata is a formal model designed for the verification of fault-tolerant consensus protocols. It has recently been extended to probabilistic threshold automata (PTAs) to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols. Nevertheless, PTA can only model randomized consensus protocols with local coins.   In this work, we extend PTA to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins. Our main idea is to add a process to simulate the common coin (the so-called common-coin process). Although the addition of the common-coin process destroys the symmetry and poses technical challenges, we show how PTA can be adapted to overcome the challenges. We apply our approach to verify the agreement, validity and almost-sure termination properties of 8 randomized consensus protocols with common coins. |

Traditional identity authentication methods, such as password-based and biometric authentications, have limitations in terms of security, privacy, and scalability. Decentralized authentication approaches leveraging blockchain technology have emerged as a promising solution. However, existing decentralized authentication methods often rely on indirect identity verification (e.g. using passwords or digital signatures as authentication credentials) and face challenges such as Sybil attacks. In this paper, we propose BioZero, an efficient and privacy-preserving decentralized biometric authentication protocol that can be implemented on open blockchain. BioZero leverages Pedersen commitment and homomorphic computation to protect user biometric privacy while enabling efficient verification. We enhance the protocol with non-interactive homomorphic computation and employ zero-knowledge proofs for secure on-chain verification. The unique aspect of BioZero is that it is fully decentralized and can be executed by blockchain smart contracts in a very efficient way. We analyze the security of BioZero and validate its performance through a prototype implementation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of BioZero in decentralized authentication scenarios. Our work contributes to the advancement of decentralized identity authentication using biometrics. |

Applying blockchain technology can establish secure data links within the IoV, solving the problems of insufficient computing resources for each vehicle and the security of data transmission over the network. However, with the development of the IoV, the amount of data interaction between multiple vehicles and between vehicles and base stations, roadside units, etc., is continuously increasing. There is a need to further reduce the interaction volume, and intelligent data compression is key to solving this problem. The VIB technique facilitates the training of encoding and decoding models, substantially diminishing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates blockchain with VIB, referred to as BVIB, designed to lighten computational workloads and reinforce the security of the network. We first construct a new network framework by separating the encoding and decoding networks to address the computational burden issue, and then propose a new algorithm to enhance the security of IoV networks. We also discuss the impact of the data extraction rate on system latency to determine the most suitable data extraction rate. An experimental framework combining Python and C++ has been established to substantiate the efficacy of our BVIB approach. Comprehensive simulation studies indicate that the BVIB consistently excels in comparison to alternative foundational methodologies. |

XDC is designed for interoperability and supports decentralized apps (dApps) and integrates smoothly with financial systems. It is perfect for trade financing and tokenisation of physical assets because of its emphasis on security and scalability. However, there are a few critical issues that hamper wider acceptance and usability for certain high-frequency applications. This whitepaper introduces a novel and enthralling dApp for establishing a gasless subnet in which mainnet XDC can be staked to spin off a subnet that functions similarly to a non-crypto network, accepting currency fees on the XDC network. This would allow users to stake their tokens without incurring gas fees making the staking process more efficient, cost-effective, and simultaneously enhancing scalability. Performance evaluation of the dApp shows promising results in terms of throughput, latency, scalability, security, and cost efficiency. The use cases and applications of this approach along with challenges and ensuing solutions are included. |

Blockchain technology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address these challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the IoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper investigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile transmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the clustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of DRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by maintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published between 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered practical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and highlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our investigation shows how combining blockchain's decentralized framework with DRL can address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission efficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally, we explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications of DRL technology. By addressing the challenges of machine learning and blockchain integration, this study proposes novel perspectives for researchers and serves as a foundational exploration from an interdisciplinary standpoint. |
|**2024-09-18**|**Novel Saliency Analysis for the Forward Forward Algorithm**|Mitra Bakhshi et.al.|[2409.15365](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15365)| Incorporating the Forward Forward algorithm into neural network training represents a transformative shift from traditional methods, introducing a dual forward mechanism that streamlines the learning process by bypassing the complexities of derivative propagation. This method is noted for its simplicity and efficiency and involves executing two forward passes the first with actual data to promote positive reinforcement, and the second with synthetically generated negative data to enable discriminative learning. Our experiments confirm that the Forward Forward algorithm is not merely an experimental novelty but a viable training strategy that competes robustly with conventional multi layer perceptron (MLP) architectures. To overcome the limitations inherent in traditional saliency techniques, which predominantly rely on gradient based methods, we developed a bespoke saliency algorithm specifically tailored for the Forward Forward framework. This innovative algorithm enhances the intuitive understanding of feature importance and network decision-making, providing clear visualizations of the data features most influential in model predictions. By leveraging this specialized saliency method, we gain deeper insights into the internal workings of the model, significantly enhancing our interpretative capabilities beyond those offered by standard approaches. Our evaluations, utilizing the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, demonstrate that our method performs comparably to traditional MLP-based models. |

Existing rollup solutions either leverage complex zero-knowledge proofs or optimistically assume execution correctness unless challenged. However, these solutions have practical issues such as high gas costs and significant withdrawal delays, hindering their adoption in decentralized applications. This paper introduces TeeRollup, an efficient rollup design with low gas costs and short withdrawal delays. TeeRollup employs Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-supported sequencers to execute transactions, requiring the blockchain to verify only the TEEs' signatures. TeeRollup is designed under a realistic threat model in which the integrity and availability of sequencers' TEEs may be compromised. To address these issues, we first introduce a distributed system of sequencers with heterogeneous TEEs, ensuring system security even if a minority of TEEs are compromised. Second, we propose a challenge mechanism to solve the redeemability issue caused by TEE unavailability. Furthermore, TeeRollup incorporates Data Availability Providers (DAPs) to reduce on-chain storage overhead and uses a laziness penalty game to regulate DAP behavior. We implement a prototype of TeeRollup in Golang, using the Ethereum test network, Sepolia. Our experimental results indicate that TeeRollup outperforms zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups), reducing on-chain verification costs by approximately 86% and withdrawal delays to a few minutes. |

Unfortunately, current exchanges suffer from high on-chain verification costs, weak threat models of central trusted parties, or synchronous requirements, making them impractical for currency trading applications. In this paper, we present MERCURY, a practical cryptocurrency exchange that is trust-minimized and efficient without online-client requirements. MERCURY leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to shield participants from malicious behaviors, eliminating the reliance on trusted participants and making on-chain verification efficient. Despite the simple idea, building a practical TEE-assisted cross-chain exchange is challenging due to the security and unavailability issues of TEEs. MERCURY tackles the unavailability problem of TEEs by implementing an efficient challenge-response mechanism executed on smart contracts. Furthermore, MERCURY utilizes a lightweight transaction verification mechanism and adopts multiple optimizations to reduce on-chain costs. Comparative evaluations with XClaim, ZK-bridge, and Tesseract demonstrate that MERCURY significantly reduces on-chain costs by approximately 67.87%, 45.01%, and 47.70%, respectively. |

|**2024-09-22**|**An Integrated Blockchain and IPFS Solution for Secure and Efficient Source Code Repository Hosting using Middleman Approach**|Md. Rafid Haque et.al.|[2409.14530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14530)| Version control systems (VCS) are essential for software development, yet centralized VCS present risks such as data loss, security breaches, and ownership disputes. While blockchain-based approaches to decentralized source code repository hosting have been explored, many existing solutions struggle with challenges related to security, scalability, efficiency, and real-time collaboration. This study seeks to enhance these efforts by proposing a novel decentralized solution that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for secure, efficient, and resilient code repository hosting and governance. Our approach introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain with the efficiency of IPFS for off-chain storage. To facilitate real-time collaboration, we integrate a temporary centralized Middleman IPFS that manages transaction processing and enhances operational efficiency without compromising long-term security. This Middleman IPFS acts as an intermediary, balancing the speed of centralized systems with the resilience of decentralized architectures. Our system uses smart contracts to maintain access control and key management by dynamically verifying access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt data stored on IPFS. This integration allows for secure, real-time collaboration in environments where multiple collaborators need concurrent access to shared resources. Our system employs a hybrid encryption scheme that combines symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. The encrypted keys are stored on the blockchain, while IPFS handles the efficient storage of the codebase itself, with a Middleman IPFS maintaining concurrent collaboration, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing large-scale, collaborative coding projects. |

This surge in interest is reflected in the exponential increase in research articles published on blockchain technology, highlighting its growing significance in the digital landscape. However, the rapid proliferation of published research presents significant challenges for manual analysis and synthesis due to the vast volume of information. The complexity and breadth of topics, combined with the inherent limitations of human data processing capabilities, make it difficult to comprehensively analyze and draw meaningful insights from the literature. To this end, we adopted the Computational Literature Review (CLR) to analyze pertinent literature impact and topic modelling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. We identified 10 topics related to security and privacy and provided a detailed description of each topic. From the critical analysis, we have observed several limitations, and several future directions are provided as an outcome of this review. |

As these networks are increasingly being integrated into smart charging infrastructures, they also introduce new vulnerabilities that threaten grid stability and user privacy This paper proposes a cyber-physical authentication protocol and trading smart contract tailored to plug and charge (PnC) operations within blockchain-based V2G systems. The protocol leverages advanced cryptographic techniques and blockchain to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof energy transactions between EVs and charging stations. Key contributions include the development of a cyber-physical authentication method, the implementation of a smart contract framework for secure energy trading, and a detailed security and privacy analysis. The proposed protocol effectively mitigates risks such as man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and replay attacks while preserving user anonymity and data integrity. |

Their ability to execute arbitrary programs in different geo-distributed regions and on diverse operating systems make them an alternative of choice to our dependence on unique software whose recent failure affected 8.5 millions of machines. As of today, it remains, however, unclear whether blockchains can truly tolerate failures.   In this paper, we assess the fault tolerance of blockchain. To this end, we inject failures in controlled deployments of five modern blockchain systems, namely Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We introduce a novel sensitivity metric, interesting in its own right, as the difference between the integrals of two cumulative distribution functions, one obtained in a baseline environment and one obtained in an adversarial environment. Our results indicate that (i) all blockchains except Redbelly are highly impacted by the failure of a small part of their network, (ii) Avalanche and Redbelly benefit from the redundant information needed for Byzantine fault tolerance while others are hampered by it, and more dramatically (iii) Avalanche and Solana cannot recover from localised transient failures. |

In such a distributed setting, blockchain smart contracts can act as neutral intermediaries to implement trustworthy decision making.   Objective: In a distributed setting, transmitted data will be structured using standards (such as HL7 FHIR) for semantic interoperability. In turn, the smart contract will require interoperability with this standard, implement a complex communication setup (e.g., using oracles), and be developed using blockchain languages (e.g., Solidity). We propose the encoding of smart contract logic using a high-level semantic Knowledge Graph, using concepts from the domain standard. We then deploy this semantic KG on blockchain.   Methods: Off-chain, a code generation pipeline compiles the KG into a concrete smart contract, which is then deployed on-chain. Our pipeline targets an intermediary bridge representation, which can be transpiled into a specific blockchain language. Our choice avoids on-chain rule engines, with unpredictable and likely higher computational cost; it is thus in line with the economic rules of blockchain.   Results: We applied our code generation approach to generate smart contracts for 3 health insurance cases from Medicare. We discuss the suitability of our approach - the need for a neutral intermediary - for a number of healthcare use cases. Our evaluation finds that the generated contracts perform well in terms of correctness and execution cost ("gas") on blockchain.   Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to automatically generate smart contract code based on a semantic KG, in a way that respects the economic rules of blockchain. Future work includes studying the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in our approach, and evaluations on other blockchains. |

First, we establish the context for this study by introducing some basic but critical technological aspects and affordances of the blockchain domain. Second, we revisit the creative practices involved in producing traditional artwork, covering various types, production processes, trading, and monetization methods. Third, we introduce and define the key fundamentals of the blockchain ecosystem, including its structure, consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and digital wallets. Fourth, we narrow the focus to NFTs, detailing their history, mechanics, lifecycle, and standards, as well as their application in the art world. In particular, we outline the key processes for minting and trading NFTs in various marketplaces and discuss the relevant market dynamics and pricing. We also consider major security concerns, such as wash trading, to underscore some of the central cybersecurity issues facing this domain. Finally, we conclude by considering future research directions, emphasizing improvements in user experience, security, and privacy. Through this innovative research overview, which includes input from creative industry and cybersecurity sdomain expertise, we offer some new insights into how NFTs can empower visual artists and reshape the wider copyright industries. |

This paper introduces a decentralized framework comprising a primary layer for managing inter-vehicle communication and a sub-layer for securing intra-vehicle interactions. By implementing blockchain-based protocols like Blockchain-integrated Secure Authentication (BiSA) and Decentralized Blockchain Name Resolution (DBNR), the framework ensures secure, decentralized identity management and reliable data exchanges, thereby supporting safe and efficient autonomous vehicle operations. |

These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data. This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts. However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.   To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems. In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request. Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake. Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract. Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available. Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters. In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty. |

In regular DDD ledgers like Blockchain, only a single level of verification is available, which makes it not useful for those systems where there is a hierarchy and verification is required on each level. In systems where hierarchy emerges naturally, the inclusion of hierarchy in the solution for the problem of the system enables us to come up with a better solution. Introduction to hierarchy means there could be several verification within a level in the hierarchy and more than one level of verification, which implies other challenges induced by an interaction between the various levels of hierarchies that also need to be addressed, like verification of the work of the previous level of hierarchy by given level in the hierarchy. The paper will address all these issues, and provide a road map to trace the state of the system at any given time and probability of failure of the system. |
|**2024-09-17**|**Decentralized Biometric Authentication based on Fuzzy Commitments and Blockchain**|Nibras Abo Alzahab et.al.|[2409.11303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11303)| Blockchain technology, which was introduced for supporting cryptocurrencies, today provides a decentralized infrastructure for general information storage and execution of algorithms, thus enabling the conversion of many applications and services from a centralized and intermediated model to a decentralized and disintermediated one. In this paper we focus on biometric authentication, which is classically performed using centralized systems, and could hence benefit from decentralization. For such a purpose, however, an inherent contradiction between biometric applications and blockchain technology must be overcome, as the former require keeping biometric features private, while blockchain is a public infrastructure. We propose a blockchain-based biometric authentication protocol that enables decentralization and resilience while protecting the privacy, personal data, and, in particular, biometric features of users. The protocol we propose leverages fuzzy commitment schemes to allow biometric authentication to be performed without disclosing biometric data. We also analyze the security of the protocol we propose by considering some relevant attacks. |
|**2024-09-17**|**Delay Analysis of EIP-4844**|Pourya Soltani et.al.|[2409.11043](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11043)| Proto-Danksharding, proposed in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), aims to incrementally improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain by introducing a new type of transaction known as blob-carrying transactions. These transactions incorporate binary large objects (blobs) of data that are stored off-chain but referenced and verified on-chain to ensure data availability. By decoupling data availability from transaction execution, Proto-Danksharding alleviates network congestion and reduces gas fees, laying the groundwork for future, more advanced sharding solutions. This letter provides an analytical model to derive the delay for these new transactions. We model the system as an $\mathrm{M/D}^B/1$ queue which we then find its steady state distribution through embedding a Markov chain and use of supplementary variable method. We show that transactions with more blobs but less frequent impose higher delays on the system compared to lower blobs but more frequent. |
|**2024-09-17**|**An Anti-disguise Authentication System Using the First Impression of Avatar in Metaverse**|Zhenyong Zhang et.al.|[2409.10850](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10850)| Metaverse is a vast virtual world parallel to the physical world, where the user acts as an avatar to enjoy various services that break through the temporal and spatial limitations of the physical world. Metaverse allows users to create arbitrary digital appearances as their own avatars by which an adversary may disguise his/her avatar to fraud others. In this paper, we propose an anti-disguise authentication method that draws on the idea of the first impression from the physical world to recognize an old friend. Specifically, the first meeting scenario in the metaverse is stored and recalled to help the authentication between avatars. To prevent the adversary from replacing and forging the first impression, we construct a chameleon-based signcryption mechanism and design a ciphertext authentication protocol to ensure the public verifiability of encrypted identities. The security analysis shows that the proposed signcryption mechanism meets not only the security requirement but also the public verifiability. Besides, the ciphertext authentication protocol has the capability of defending against the replacing and forging attacks on the first impression. Extensive experiments show that the proposed avatar authentication system is able to achieve anti-disguise authentication at a low storage consumption on the blockchain. |
|**2024-09-16**|**Deterministic Bounds in Committee Selection: Enhancing Decentralization and Scalability in Distributed Ledgers**|Grigorii Melnikov et.al.|[2409.10727](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10727)| Consensus plays a crucial role in distributed ledger systems, impacting both scalability and decentralization. Many blockchain systems use a weighted lottery based on a scarce resource such as a stake, storage, memory, or computing power to select a committee whose members drive the consensus and are responsible for adding new information to the ledger. Therefore, ensuring a robust and fair committee selection process is essential for maintaining security, efficiency, and decentralization.   There are two main approaches to randomized committee selection. In one approach, each validator candidate locally checks whether they are elected to the committee and reveals their proof during the consensus phase. In contrast, in the second approach, a sortition algorithm decides a fixed-sized committee that is globally verified. This paper focuses on the latter approach, with cryptographic sortition as a method for fair committee selection that guarantees a constant committee size. Our goal is to develop deterministic guarantees that strengthen decentralization. We introduce novel methods that provide deterministic bounds on the influence of adversaries within the committee, as evidenced by numerical experiments. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing protocols that only offer probabilistic guarantees, often providing large committees that are impractical for many quorum-based applications like atomic broadcast and randomness beacon protocols. |
|**2024-10-26**|**Detection Made Easy: Potentials of Large Language Models for Solidity Vulnerabilities**|Md Tauseef Alam et.al.|[2409.10574](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10574)| The large-scale deployment of Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet has increasingly attracted financially-motivated attackers in recent years. A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach. |

There have been several major attacks on blockchain-based systems, leaving a gap in the trustability of this system. This article presents a comprehensive study of 23 attacks on blockchain systems and categorizes them using a layer-based approach. This approach provides an in-depth analysis of the feasibility and motivation of these attacks. In addition, a framework is proposed that enables a systematic analysis of the impact and interconnection of these attacks, thereby providing a means of identifying potential attack vectors and designing appropriate countermeasures to strengthen any blockchain system. |
|**2024-09-16**|**Assessing the Impact of Sanctions in the Crypto Ecosystem: Effective Measures or Ineffective Deterrents?**|Francesco Zola et.al.|[2409.10031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10031)| Regulatory authorities aim to tackle illegal activities by targeting the economic incentives that drive such behaviour. This is typically achieved through the implementation of financial sanctions against the entities involved in the crimes. However, the rise of cryptocurrencies has presented new challenges, allowing entities to evade these sanctions and continue criminal operations. Consequently, enforcement measures have been expanded to include crypto assets information of sanctioned entities. Yet, due to the nature of the crypto ecosystem, blocking or freezing these digital assets is harder and, in some cases, such as with Bitcoin, unfeasible. Therefore, sanctions serve merely as deterrents. For this reason, in this study, we aim to assess the impact of these sanctions on entities' crypto activities, particularly those related to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our objective is to shed light on the validity and effectiveness (or lack thereof) of such countermeasures. Specifically, we analyse the transactions and the amount of USD moved by punished entities that possess crypto addresses after being sanctioned by the authority agency. Results indicate that while sanctions have been effective for half of the examined entities, the others continue to move funds through sanctioned addresses. Furthermore, punished entities demonstrate a preference for utilising rapid exchange services to convert their funds, rather than employing dedicated money laundering services. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers valuable insights into how entities use crypto assets to circumvent sanctions. |

This paper proposes a federated learning data ownership confirmation mechanism based on blockchain and smart contract, which uses decentralized blockchain technology to save the contribution of each participant on the blockchain, and distributes the benefits of federated learning results through the blockchain. In the local simulation environment of the blockchain, the relevant smart contracts and data structures are simulated and implemented, and the feasibility of the scheme is preliminarily demonstrated. |

We propose a system that automates the enforcement of security policies, reducing manual effort and potential human error. Utilizing AI, we can analyse cyber threat intelligence rapidly, identify non-compliances and automatically adjust cyber defence mechanisms. Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for transparent logging of compliance actions, while smart contracts ensure uniform application of security measures. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations, showing improvements in compliance enforcement rates and response times compared to traditional methods. Ultimately, our approach provides for a scalable solution for managing complex security policies, reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency while achieving compliance. Finally, we discuss practical implications and propose future research directions to further refine the system and address implementation challenges. |

However, the NFT market has recently experienced a downturn in interest, mainly due to challenges related to high entry barriers and limited market liquidity. Fractionalization emerges as a promising solution, allowing multiple parties to hold a stake in a single NFT. By breaking down ownership into fractional shares, this approach lowers the entry barrier for investors, enhances market liquidity, and democratizes access to valuable digital assets. Despite these benefits, the current landscape of NFT fractionalization is fragmented, with no standardized framework to guide the secure and interoperable implementation of fractionalization mechanisms. This paper contributions are twofold: first, we provide a detailed analysis of the current NFT fractionalization landscape focusing on security challenges; second, we introduce a standardized approach that addresses these challenges, paving the way for more secure, interoperable, and accessible NFT fractionalization platforms. |
|**2024-09-12**|**A Study on Asynchronous Vote-based Blockchains**|Yibin Xu et.al.|[2409.08161](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08161)| Vote-based blockchains construct a state machine replication (SMR) system among participating nodes, using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols to transition from one state to another. Currently, they rely on either synchronous or partially synchronous networks with leader-based coordination or costly Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocols in asynchronous settings, making them impractical for large-scale asynchronous applications.   To make Asynchronous SMR scalable, this paper proposes a \emph{validated strong} BFT consensus model that allows leader-based coordination in asynchronous settings. Our BFT consensus model offers the same level of tolerance as binary byzantine agreement but does not demand consistency among honest nodes before they vote. An SMR using our model allows nodes to operate in different, tentative, but mutually exclusive states until they eventually converge on the same state. We propose an asynchronous BFT protocol for vote-based blockchains employing our consensus model to address several critical challenges: how to ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state across voting rounds, how to assure that a blockchain will steadily progress through epochs while reaching consensus for previous epochs, and how to maintain robust byzantine fault tolerance.   Our protocol greatly reduces message complexity and is the first one to achieve linear view changes without relying on threshold signatures. We prove that an asynchronous blockchain built on our protocol can operate with the \emph{same} simplicity and efficiency as partially synchronous blockchains built on, e.g. HotStuff-2. This facilitates deploying asynchronous blockchains across large-scale networks. |

The methodology is centred on creating a model where doctors would vote on treatment inclusions, aiming to demonstrate transparency and integrity. The results from Monte Carlo simulations suggest a robust consensus on the selection of medicines and treatments.

It identifies technical challenges such as scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability, as well as business and adoption challenges, and the social, economic, ethical, and environmental controversies present in current blockchain systems. We argue that responsible blockchain development is key to overcoming these challenges and achieving mass adoption. This paper defines Responsible Blockchain and introduces the STEADI principles (sustainable, transparent, ethical, adaptive, decentralized, and inclusive) for responsible blockchain development.

Leveraging the theoretical principles of differential privacy, our approach strategically integrates noise into trained sub-models before reconstructing the global model through transmission. We systematically explore the effects of various noise types, i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, and Moment Accountant, on key performance metrics, including attack detection accuracy, deep learning model convergence time, and the overall runtime of global model generation. Our findings reveal the intricate trade-offs between ensuring data privacy and maintaining system performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing these parameters for diverse CCD environments. Through extensive simulations, we provide actionable recommendations for achieving an optimal balance between data protection and system efficiency, contributing to the advancement of secure and reliable blockchain networks. |

Cross-chain transaction association identifies and matches unique transactions executed by bridge DApps, which is important research to enhance the traceability of cross-chain bridge DApps. However, existing methods rely entirely on unobservable internal ledgers or APIs, violating the open and decentralized properties of blockchain. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of this issue and then present CONNECTOR, an automated cross-chain transaction association analysis method based on bridge smart contracts. Specifically, CONNECTOR first identifies deposit transactions by extracting distinctive and generic features from the transaction traces of bridge contracts. With the accurate deposit transactions, CONNECTOR mines the execution logs of bridge contracts to achieve withdrawal transaction matching. We conduct real-world experiments on different types of bridges to demonstrate the effectiveness of CONNECTOR. The experiment demonstrates that CONNECTOR successfully identifies 100% deposit transactions, associates 95.81% withdrawal transactions, and surpasses methods for CeFi bridges. Based on the association results, we obtain interesting findings about cross-chain transaction behaviors in DeFi bridges and analyze the tracing abilities of CONNECTOR to assist the DeFi bridge apps. |

This work demonstrates that the Ethereum P2P network does not offer this anonymity. We present a methodology that enables any node in the network to identify validators hosted on connected peers and empirically verify the feasibility of our proposed method. Using data collected from four nodes over three days, we locate more than 15% of Ethereum validators in the P2P network. The insights gained from our deanonymization technique provide valuable information on the distribution of validators across peers, their geographic locations, and hosting organizations. We further discuss the implications and risks associated with the lack of anonymity in the P2P network and propose methods to help validators protect their privacy. The Ethereum Foundation has awarded us a bug bounty, acknowledging the impact of our results. |

Among the methods used for this purpose are traditional IdMs (isolated, centralised and federated) that mostly rely on identity providers (IdPs) to broker trust between a user and service-providers (SPs). An IdP also identifies and authenticates a user on-behalf of the SP, who then determines the authorisation of the user. In these processes, both SP and IdP collect, process or store private users' data, which can be prone to breach. One approach to address the data breach is to relieve the IdP, and return control and storage of personal data to the owner. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) was introduced as an IdM model to reduce the possibility of data breaches by offering control of personal data to the owner. SSI is a decentralised IdM, where the data owner has sovereign control of personal data stored in their digital wallet. Since SSI is an emerging technology, its components and methods require careful evaluation. This paper provides an evolution to IdMs and reviews the state-of-the-art SSI frameworks. We explored articles in the literature that reviewed blockchain solutions for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We systematically searched recent SSI and blockchain proposals, evaluated the compliance of the retrieved documents with the GDPR privacy principles, and discussed their potentials, constraints, and limitations. This work identifies potential research gaps and opportunities. |
|**2024-09-05**|**Tyche: Collateral-Free Coalition-Resistant Multiparty Lotteries with Arbitrary Payouts**|Quentin Kniep et.al.|[2409.03464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03464)| We propose Tyche, a family of protocols for performing practically (as well as asymptotically) efficient multiparty lotteries, resistant against aborts and majority coalitions. Our protocols are based on a commit-and-reveal approach, requiring only a collision-resistant hash function.   All our protocols use a blockchain as a public bulletin board and for buy-in collection and payout settlement. Importantly though, they do not rely on it or any other third party for providing randomness. Also, participants are not required to post any collateral beyond their buy-in. Any honest participant can eventually settle the lottery, and dishonest behavior never reduces the winning probability of any honest participant.   Further, we adapt all three protocols into anonymous lotteries, where (under certain conditions) the winner is unlinkable to any particular participant. We show that our protocols are secure, fair, and some preserve the participants' privacy.   Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocols, particularly in terms of transaction fees, by implementing them on the Sui blockchain. There we see that per user transaction fees are reasonably low and our protocols could potentially support millions of participants. |

As single blockchain users grow, scalability becomes crucial. However, existing works lack a comprehensive summary of blockchain scalability. They focus on single chains or cross-chain technologies. This survey summarizes scalability across the physical and logical layers, as well as inner-chain, inter-chain, and technology dimensions. The physical layer covers data and protocols, while the logical layer represents blockchain architecture. Each component is analyzed from inner-chain and inter-chain perspectives, considering technological factors.

We experimentally quantify the resilience of Snowball using a simulation implemented in Rust, where the adversary strategically rebalances the network to delay termination.   We show that in a network of $n$ nodes of equal stake, the adversary is able to break liveness when controlling $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ nodes. Specifically, for $n = 2000$, a simple adversary controlling $5.2\%$ of stake can successfully attack liveness. When the adversary is given additional information about the state of the network (without any communication or other advantages), the stake needed for a successful attack is as little as $2.8\%$. We show that the adversary can break safety in time exponentially dependent on their stake, and inversely linearly related to the size of the network, e.g. in 265 rounds in expectation when the adversary controls $25\%$ of a network of 3000.   We conclude that Snowball and Avalanche are akin to Byzantine reliable broadcast protocols as opposed to consensus. |

However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology. This review aims to provide new perspectives and a research foundation for the integrated development of blockchain technology and machine learning, supporting further innovation and application expansion of blockchain technology. |

ZK-friendly hash functions, as key algorithms in blockchain, have garnered significant attention. Therefore, comprehensive benchmarking and evaluations of these evolving algorithms in ZK circuits present both promising opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we focus on a popular ZKP application, privacy-preserving transaction protocols, aiming to leverage SNARKs' cost-efficiency through "batch processing" to address high on-chain costs and compliance issues.   To this end, we benchmarked three SNARK proving systems and five ZK-friendly hash functions, including our self-developed circuit templates for Poseidon2, Neptune, and GMiMC, on the bn254 curve within the circom-snarkjs framework. We also introduced the role of "sequencer" in our SNARK-based privacy-preserving transaction scheme to enhance efficiency and enable flexible auditing. We conducted privacy and security analyses, as well as implementation and evaluation on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. The results indicate that Poseidon and Poseidon2 demonstrate superior memory usage and runtime during proof generation under Groth16. Moreover, compared to the baseline, Poseidon2 not only generates proofs faster but also reduces on-chain costs by 73% on EVM chains and nearly 26% on Hedera. Our work provides a benchmark for ZK-friendly hash functions and ZK tools, while also exploring cost efficiency and compliance in ZKP-based privacy-preserving transaction protocols. |

Therefore, it could hold great promise in swarm robotics applications. However, federated learning usually requires a centralized server for the aggregation of the models. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of federated learning in a robot swarm that does not compromise decentralization. To do so, we use blockchain technology to enable our robot swarm to securely synchronize a shared model that is the aggregation of the individual models without relying on a central server. We then show that introducing a single malfunctioning robot can, however, heavily disrupt the training process. To prevent such situations, we devise protection mechanisms that are implemented through secure and tamper-proof blockchain smart contracts. Our experiments are conducted in ARGoS, a physics-based simulator for swarm robotics, using the Ethereum blockchain protocol which is executed by each simulated robot. |

Ballandies et.al.|[2409.01823](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01823)| Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechansims to improve DAO design and construction, a practical design framework for DAOs is created. This contribution lays a foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science and DAOs. |
|**2024-09-17**|**Strengthening Solidity Invariant Generation: From Post- to Pre-Deployment**|Kartik Kaushik et.al.|[2409.01804](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01804)| Invariants are essential for ensuring the security and correctness of Solidity smart contracts, particularly in the context of blockchain's immutability and decentralized execution. This paper introduces InvSol, a novel framework for pre-deployment invariant generation tailored specifically for Solidity smart contracts. Unlike existing solutions, namely InvCon, InvCon+, and Trace2Inv, that rely on post-deployment transaction histories on Ethereum mainnet, InvSol identifies invariants before deployment and offers comprehensive coverage of Solidity language constructs, including loops. Additionally, InvSol incorporates custom templates to effectively prevent critical issues such as reentrancy, out-of-gas errors, and exceptions during invariant generation. We rigorously evaluate InvSol using a benchmark set of smart contracts and compare its performance with state-of-the-art solutions. Our findings reveal that InvSol significantly outperforms these tools, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling new contracts with limited transaction histories. Notably, InvSol achieves a 15% improvement in identifying common vulnerabilities compared to InvCon+ and is able to address certain crucial vulnerabilities using specific invariant templates, better than Trace2Inv. |

|**2024-09-03**|**On-chain Validation of Tracking Data Messages (TDM) Using Distributed Deep Learning on a Proof of Stake (PoS) Blockchain**|Yasir Latif et.al.|[2409.01614](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01614)| Trustless tracking of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) is crucial for Space Situational Awareness (SSA), especially during adverse situations. The importance of transparent SSA cannot be overstated, as it is vital for ensuring space safety and security. In an era where RSO location information can be easily manipulated, the risk of RSOs being used as weapons is a growing concern. The Tracking Data Message (TDM) is a standardized format for broadcasting RSO observations. However, the varying quality of observations from diverse sensors poses challenges to SSA reliability. While many countries operate space assets, relatively few have SSA capabilities, making it crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Current practices assume complete trust in the transmitting party, leaving SSA capabilities vulnerable to adversarial actions such as spoofing TDMs. This work introduces a trustless mechanism for TDM validation and verification using deep learning over blockchain. By leveraging the trustless nature of blockchain, our approach eliminates the need for a central authority, establishing consensus-based truth. We propose a state-of-the-art, transformer-based orbit propagator that outperforms traditional methods like SGP4, enabling cross-validation of multiple observations for a single RSO. This deep learning-based transformer model can be distributed over a blockchain, allowing interested parties to host a node that contains a part of the distributed deep learning model. Our system comprises decentralised observers and validators within a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. Observers contribute TDM data along with a stake to ensure honesty, while validators run the propagation and validation algorithms. The system rewards observers for contributing verified TDMs and penalizes those submitting unverifiable data. |
|**2024-09-03**|**Blockchain-based Federated Recommendation with Incentive Mechanism**|Jianhai Chen et.al.|[2409.01563](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01563)| Nowadays, federated recommendation technology is rapidly evolving to help multiple organisations share data and train models while meeting user privacy, data security and government regulatory requirements. However, federated recommendation increases customer system costs such as power, computational and communication resources. Besides, federated recommendation systems are also susceptible to model attacks and data poisoning by participating malicious clients. Therefore, most customers are unwilling to participate in federated recommendation without any incentive. To address these problems, we propose a blockchain-based federated recommendation system with incentive mechanism to promote more trustworthy, secure, and efficient federated recommendation service. First, we construct a federated recommendation system based on NeuMF and FedAvg. Then we introduce a reverse auction mechanism to select optimal clients that can maximize the social surplus. Finally, we employ blockchain for on-chain evidence storage of models to ensure the safety of the federated recommendation system. The experimental results show that our proposed incentive mechanism can attract clients with superior training data to engage in the federal recommendation at a lower cost, which can increase the economic benefit of federal recommendation by 54.9\% while improve the recommendation performance. Thus our work provides theoretical and technological support for the construction of a harmonious and healthy ecological environment for the application of federal recommendation. |
|**2024-09-02**|**A Survey and Comparison of Post-quantum and Quantum Blockchains**|Zebo Yang et.al.|[2409.01358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01358)| Blockchains have gained substantial attention from academia and industry for their ability to facilitate decentralized trust and communications. However, the rapid progress of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of existing blockchain technologies. Notably, the emergence of Shor's and Grover's algorithms raises concerns regarding the compromise of the cryptographic systems underlying blockchains. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods that reinforce blockchain technology against quantum attacks. In response to this challenge, two distinct approaches have been proposed. The first approach involves post-quantum blockchains, which aim to utilize classical cryptographic algorithms resilient to quantum attacks. The second approach explores quantum blockchains, which leverage the power of quantum computers and networks to rebuild the foundations of blockchains. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and comparison of post-quantum and quantum blockchains while exploring open questions and remaining challenges in these domains. It offers an in-depth introduction, examines differences in blockchain structure, security, privacy, and other key factors, and concludes by discussing current research trends. |

|**2024-09-06**|**Weighted Regression with Sybil Networks**|Nihar Shah et.al.|[2408.17426](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17426)| In many online domains, Sybil networks -- or cases where a single user assumes multiple identities -- is a pervasive feature. This complicates experiments, as off-the-shelf regression estimators at least assume known network topologies (if not fully independent observations) when Sybil network topologies in practice are often unknown. The literature has exclusively focused on techniques to detect Sybil networks, leading many experimenters to subsequently exclude suspected networks entirely before estimating treatment effects. I present a more efficient solution in the presence of these suspected Sybil networks: a weighted regression framework that applies weights based on the probabilities that sets of observations are controlled by single actors. I show in the paper that the MSE-minimizing solution is to set the weight matrix equal to the inverse of the expected network topology. I demonstrate the methodology on simulated data, and then I apply the technique to a competition with suspected Sybil networks run on the Sui blockchain and show reductions in the standard error of the estimate by 6 - 24%. |
|**2024-08-30**|**A Framework for Digital Asset Risks with Insurance Applications**|Zhengming Li et.al.|[2408.17227](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17227)| The remarkable growth of digital assets, starting from the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 into a 1 trillion market in 2024, underscores the momentum behind disruptive technologies and the global appetite for digital assets. This paper develops a framework to enhance actuaries' understanding of the cyber risks associated with the developing digital asset ecosystem, as well as their measurement methods in the context of digital asset insurance. By integrating actuarial perspectives, we aim to enhance understanding and modeling of cyber risks at both the micro and systemic levels. The qualitative examination sheds light on blockchain technology and its associated risks, while our quantitative framework offers a rigorous approach to modeling cyber risks in digital asset insurance portfolios. This multifaceted approach serves three primary objectives: i) offer a clear and accessible education on the evolving digital asset ecosystem and the diverse spectrum of cyber risks it entails; ii) develop a scientifically rigorous framework for quantifying cyber risks in the digital asset ecosystem; iii) provide practical applications, including pricing strategies and tail risk management. Particularly, we develop frequency-severity models based on real loss data for pricing cyber risks in digit assets and utilize Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the tail risks, offering practical insights for risk management strategies. As digital assets continue to reshape finance, our work serves as a foundational step towards safeguarding the integrity and stability of this rapidly evolving landscape. |

However, there have been some major issues related to identity management and ownership transfer involving IoT devices, particularly for consumer IoT devices, e. g. smart appliances such as smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and so on. There have been a few attempts to address this issue; however, user-centric and effective ownership and identity management of IoT devices have not been very successful so far. Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address these issues with limited success. This article presents a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) based system that facilitates a secure and user-centric ownership management and transfer of consumer IoT devices. The system leverages a number of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and decentralized identifiers (DID), verifiable credentials (VC), under the umbrella of SSI. We present the architecture of the system based on a threat model and requirement analysis, discuss the implementation of a Proof-of-Concept based on the proposed system and illustrate a number of use-cases with their detailed protocol flows. Furthermore, we analyse its security using ProVerif, a state-of-the art protocol verification tool and examine its performance. |
|**2024-09-02**|**Leveraging Blockchain and ANFIS for Optimal Supply Chain Management**|Amirfarhad Farhadi et.al.|[2408.17161](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17161)| The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues. |
|**2024-08-30**|**SPOQchain: Platform for Secure, Scalable, and Privacy-Preserving Supply Chain Tracing and Counterfeit Protection**|Moritz Finke et.al.|[2408.17049](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17049)| Product lifecycle tracing is increasingly in the focus of regulators and producers, as shown with the initiative of the Digital Product Pass. Likewise, new methods of counterfeit detection are developed that are, e.g., based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In order to ensure trust and integrity of product lifecycle data, multiple existing supply chain tracing systems are built on blockchain technology. However, only few solutions employ secure identifiers such as PUFs. Furthermore, existing systems that publish the data of individual products, in part fully transparently, have a detrimental impact on scalability and the privacy of users. This work proposes SPOQchain, a novel blockchain-based platform that provides comprehensive lifecycle traceability and originality verification while ensuring high efficiency and user privacy. The improved efficiency is achieved by a sophisticated batching mechanism that removes lifecycle redundancies. In addition to the successful evaluation of SPOQchain's scalability, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy and security aspects, demonstrating the need and qualification of SPOQchain for the future of supply chain tracing. |
|**2024-08-29**|**A Prototype Model of Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain with EigenTrust-Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Protocol to Manage Decentralized Clinical Trials**|Ashok Kumar Peepliwall et.al.|[2408.16885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16885)| The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done to evaluate the quality of the system. |

On-chain computations can be prohibitively expensive, making many CPU-intensive computations infeasible. Inspired by the structure of IBM's token ring networks, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol called Monadring to address these issues. Monadring allows nodes within a large blockchain network to form smaller subnetworks, enabling faster and more cost-effective computations while maintaining the security guarantees of the main blockchain network.   To further enhance Monadring's security, we introduce a node rotation mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and blind voting using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within the smaller subnetwork. Unlike the common voting-based election of validator nodes, Monadring leverages FHE to conceal voting information, eliminating the advantage of the last mover in the voting process.   This paper details the design and implementation of the Monadring protocol and evaluates its performance and feasibility through simulation experiments. Our research contributes to enhancing the practical utility of blockchain technology in large-scale application scenarios. |

Nevertheless, the sensitive nature of medical data presents security and privacy challenges. On the other hand, resource constraints of IoT devices often necessitates cloud services for data handling, introducing single points of failure, processing delays, and security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the blockchain technology offers potential solutions for enhancing security, decentralization, and data ownership. An ideal solution should ensure confidentiality, access control, and data integrity while being scalable, cost-effective, and integrable with the existing systems. However, current blockchain-based studies only address some of these requirements. Accordingly, this paper proposes EdgeLinker; a comprehensive solution incorporating Proof-of-Authority consensus, integrating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control, and advanced cryptographic algorithms for secure data communication between IoT edge devices and the fog layer in healthcare fog applications. This novel framework has been implemented in a real-world fog testbed, using COTS fog devices. Based on a comprehensive set of evaluations, EdgeLinker demonstrates significant improvements in security and privacy with reasonable costs, making it an affordable and practical system for healthcare fog applications. Compared with the state-of-the-art, without significant changes in the write-time to the blockchain, EdgeLinker achieves a 35% improvement in data read time. Additionally, it is able to provide better throughput in both reading and writing transactions compared to the existing studies. EdgeLinker has been also examined in terms of energy, resource consumption and channel latency in both secure and non-secure modes, which has shown remarkable improvements. |

However, when detecting vulnerabilities in inter-contract interactions (i.e., cross-contract vulnerabilities) using smart contract bytecode, existing tools often produce many false positives and false negatives due to insufficient recovery of semantic information and inadequate consideration of contract dependencies. We present CrossInspector, a novel framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities at the bytecode level through static analysis. CrossInspector utilizes a trained Transformer model to recover semantic information and considers control flow, data flow, and dependencies related to smart contract state variables to construct a state dependency graph for fine-grained inter-procedural analysis. Additionally, CrossInspector incorporates a pruning method and two parallel optimization mechanisms to accelerate the vulnerability detection process. Experiments on our manually constructed dataset demonstrate that CrossInspector outperforms the state-of-the-art tools in both precision (97\%) and recall (96.75\%), while also significantly reducing the overall time from 16.34 seconds to 7.83 seconds, almost on par with the fastest tool that utilizes bytecode for detection. Additionally, we ran CrossInspector on a randomly selected set of 300 real-world smart contracts and identified 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities that were missed by prior tools. |
|**2024-08-23**|**IoT Monitoring with Blockchain: Generating Smart Contracts from Service Level Agreements**|Adam Booth et.al.|[2408.15016](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15016)| A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a client and provider that assures the quality of service (QoS) a client can expect to receive when purchasing a service. However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things (IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer, resulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following research aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT systems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable amongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development of a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given SLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock scenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In this scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing all emulated violations. |
|**2024-08-26**|**Behavior-Based Detection of GPU Cryptojacking**|Dmitry Tanana et.al.|[2408.14554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14554)| With the surge in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, illegal mining for cryptocurrency has become a popular cyberthreat. Host-based cryptojacking, where malicious actors exploit victims systems to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge, is on the rise. Regular cryptojacking is relatively well-known and well-studied threat, however, recently attackers started switching to GPU cryptojacking, which promises greater profits due to high GPU hash rates and lower detection chance. Additionally, GPU cryptojackers can easily propagate using, for example, modified graphic card drivers. This article considers question of GPU cryptojacking detection. First, we discuss brief history and definition of GPU cryptojacking as well as previous attempts to design a detection technique for such threats. We also propose complex exposure mechanism based on GPU load by an application and graphic card RAM consumption, which can be used to detect both browser-based and host-based cryptojacking samples. Then we design a prototype decision tree detection program based on our technique. It was tested in a controlled virtual machine environment with 80% successful detection rate against selected set of GPU cryptojacking samples and 20% false positive rate against selected number of legitimate GPU-heavy applications. |

We develop a probabilistic model characterizing the distribution of path lengths in Patricia tries containing random Ethereum addresses and validate this model through extensive computational experiments. Our findings reveal the logarithmic scaling of average path lengths with respect to the number of addresses, confirming a crucial property for Ethereum's scalability. The study demonstrates high precision in predicting average path lengths, with discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results not exceeding 0.01 across tested scales from 100 to 100,000 addresses. We identify and verify the right-skewed nature of path length distributions, providing insights into worst-case scenarios and informing optimization strategies. Statistical analysis, including chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, strongly supports the model's accuracy. The research offers structural insights into node concentration at specific trie levels, suggesting avenues for optimizing storage and retrieval mechanisms. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Ethereum's fundamental data structures and provide a solid foundation for future optimizations. The study concludes by outlining potential directions for future research, including investigations into extreme-scale behavior, dynamic trie performance, and the applicability of the model to non-uniform address distributions and other blockchain systems. |

Although this cryptocurrency is based on a decentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw blockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol specificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset, we present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph formalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to January 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity transaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is given in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This dataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and associated public addresses. |

Central to our design is a novel consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Merit (PoM), specifically crafted for environments where businesses must solve complex problems before transactions can be recorded. PoM integrates the generation and recording of transactions within a unified blockchain system, fundamentally differing from prevailing consensus mechanisms that primarily record existing transactions. We demonstrate PoM on a ride service on-demand platform, where the task of solving complex transaction-generating problems is delegated to a pool of independent problem solvers. These solvers generate transactions, and their solutions are selected based on merit. The winning solvers then register these transactions onto the blockchain and are rewarded accordingly. We introduce a Decentralized Control Parameter (DCP) to balance two key performance metrics: efficiency and equity. The applicability of our generative blockchain is illustrated through a ridesharing context, where matchers (solvers) are tasked with matching riders to drivers. We demonstrate PoM's performance and nuanced properties using agent-based simulation, exploring how to find the optimal DCP value to achieve a desirable balance of efficiency and equity in a generative blockchain. |
|**2024-12-02**|**Fair Combinatorial Auction for Blockchain Trade Intents: Being Fair without Knowing What is Fair**|Andrea Canidio et.al.|[2408.12225](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12225)| Blockchain trade intent auctions currently intermediate approximately USD 5 billion monthly. Due to production complementarities, the auction is combinatorial: when multiple trade intents from different traders are auctioned off simultaneously, a bidder (here called solver) can generate additional efficiencies by winning a batch of multiple trade intents. However, sharing these additional efficiencies between traders is problematic: because of market frictions and fees (solvers' private information), the auctioneer does not know how much each trader would have received had its trade been auctioned off individually. We formalize this problem and study the most commonly used auction formats: batch auctions and multiple simultaneous auctions. We also propose a novel fair combinatorial auction that combines batch auction and multiple simultaneous auctions: solvers submit individual-trade bids and batched bids, but batched bids are considered only if they are better for all traders relative to the outcome of the simultaneous auctions constructed using the individual-trade bids. We find a trade-off between the fairness guarantees provided in equilibrium by the auction (i.e., the minimum each trader can expect to receive) and the expected value of the assets returned to the traders. Also, the amount that each trader receives in the equilibrium of the fair combinatorial auction may be higher or lower than what they receive in the equilibrium of the simultaneous auctions used as a benchmark for fairness. |

Regulatory frameworks for crypto assets are actively being developed and refined, increasing the likelihood of such actions. The lack of systematic analysis of the factors driving litigation against blockchain entities leaves companies in need of clarity to navigate compliance risks. This absence of insight also deprives investors of the information for informed decision-making. This study focuses on U.S. litigation against blockchain entities, particularly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) given its influence on global crypto regulation. Utilizing frontier pretrained language models and large language models, we systematically map all SEC complaints against blockchain companies from 2012 to 2024 to thematic factors conceptualized by our study to delineate the factors driving SEC actions. We quantify the thematic factors and assess their influence on specific legal Acts cited within the complaints on an annual basis, allowing us to discern the regulatory emphasis, patterns and conduct trend analysis. |

Blockchain technology is currently considered a valuable aid in the transition to a circular economy. Its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature enables the construction of transparent and secure supply chain management systems, thereby improving product accountability and traceability. However, the full potential of blockchain technology in circular economy models will not be realized until a number of concerns, including scalability, interoperability, data protection, and regulatory and legal issues, are addressed. More research and stakeholder participation are required to overcome these limitations and achieve the benefits of blockchain technology in promoting a circular economy. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that identified industry use cases for blockchain-driven circular economy models and offered architectures to minimize resource consumption, prices, and inefficiencies while encouraging the reuse, recycling, and recovery of end-of-life products. Three main outcomes emerged from our review of 41 documents, which included scholarly publications, Twitter-linked information, and Google results. The relationship between blockchain and the 4R framework for circular economy; discussion the terminology and various forms of blockchain and circular economy; and identification of the challenges and obstacles that blockchain technology may face in enabling a circular economy. This research shows how blockchain technology can help with the transition to a circular economy. Yet, it emphasizes the importance of additional study and stakeholder participation to overcome potential hurdles and obstacles in implementing blockchain-driven circular economy models. |

Previous privacy-preservation methodologies have addressed privacy in which data are permanently stored in repositories and disconnected from changing data provider privacy preferences. This occurrence becomes evident as data moves to another data repository. Hence, the need for data providers to control and flexibly update their existing privacy preferences due to changing data usage continues to remain a problem. This paper proposes a blockchain-based methodology for preserving data providers private and sensitive data. The research proposes to tightly couple data providers private attribute data element to privacy preferences and data accessor data element into a privacy tuple. The implementation presents a framework of tightly-coupled relational database and blockchains. This delivers secure, tamper-resistant, and query-efficient platform for data management and query processing. The evaluation analysis from the implementation validates efficient query processing of privacy-aware queries on the privacy infrastructure. |

We demonstrate that Execution Tickets extract all MEV when all buyers are homogeneous, risk neutral and face no capital costs. We also show that MEV capture decreases with risk aversion and capital costs. Moreover, when buyers are heterogeneous, MEV capture can be especially low and a single dominant buyer can extract much of the MEV. This adverse effect can be partially mitigated by the presence of a Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism, which gives ET buyers access to a market of specialized builders, but in practice centralization vectors still persist. With PBS, ETs are concentrated among those with the highest ex-ante MEV extraction ability and lowest cost of capital. We show how it is possible that large investors that are not builders but have substantial advantage in capital cost can come to dominate the ET market. |

However, data availability and privacy concerns pose significant challenges. Traditional methods like data encryption and anonymization, while essential, may not fully address these issues. For instance, in sparsely populated areas, anonymized data can still be traced back to individual users. Additionally, the volume of data generated by users can reveal their identities. To develop credible crowd-sensing systems, data must be anonymized, aggregated and separated into uniformly sized chunks. Furthermore, decentralizing the data management process, rather than relying on a single server, can enhance security and trust. This paper proposes a system utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technologies to manage crowd-sensing campaigns. The smart contract handles user subscriptions, data encryption, and decentralized storage, creating a secure data marketplace. Incentive policies within the smart contract encourage user participation and data diversity. Simulation results confirm the system's viability, highlighting the importance of user participation for data credibility and the impact of geographical data scarcity on rewards. This approach aims to balance data origin and reduce cheating risks. |

Unfortunately, the consumer blockchain often accepts these results without executing the smart contracts for validation, posing potential security risks. To address this, we propose a method for validating cross-chain smart contract results. Our approach emphasizes consumer blockchain execution of cross-chain smart contracts of producer blockchain, allowing comparison of results with the transmitted ones to detect potential discrepancies and ensure data integrity during cross-chain data dissemination. Additionally, we introduce the confirmation with proof method, which involves incorporating the chain of blocks and relevant cross-chain smart contract data from the producer blockchain into the consumer blockchain as evidence (or proof), establishing a unified and secure perspective of cross-chain smart contract results. Our verification results highlight the feasibility of cross-chain validation at the smart contract level. |

For inquiry and auditability purposes, it is essential that the news, once classified as false, can be persisted in an immutable means so that interested parties can query it. Although Blockchain clearly satisfies the main requirements for Fake News Management Software Systems, the prescriptive architectural solutions for that domain that cohabit Blockchain with other technologies in a single proposal still need to be made available. This paper's main contribution is presenting a prescriptive architectural solution for blockchain-based fake news management software systems. The Hoffmeister process for software architecture design is systematically followed to culminate in a software solution for that domain. The implementation of two candidate architectures and a brief simulation-based evaluation show the feasibility of the solution to satisfy the functional and quality requirements. |

The intended result is a digital portfolio with work samples - and not just certificates, which can be understood as a portfolio examination in the context of academic assessment. This is more about the recording, evaluation and certification of learning progress and competencies than the selective evaluation of a performance review, as is the case today, for example, with the submission of final theses. The idea is to expand and later replace final papers and performance tests, particularly in higher semesters, and instead introduce electronically recorded portfolio examinations - based on the example of teaching projects.   Technologically, the approach is based on blockchain and wallets/repositories and, in the broadest sense, on an implementation of smart contracts. The technological approach of smart contracts enables a high degree of traceability and transparency with little administrative effort. It also offers secure certification of services by the provider. It should be clearly stated that neither the portfolio examination nor the administration of academic achievements with smart contracts is the original idea, but rather the change in the recording of academic achievements towards an alternative approach to the recording and evaluation of student performance, which enables sustainable performance recording with the possibility of integrating practical components in particular. The desired result is a digital portfolio with work samples.   The primary aim of this idea sketch is to develop an individualized performance record for students, which can also contribute to making performance more transparent and comprehensible. |

Supply Chain Finance-related research can support multiple applications and services, such as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk management, and optimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of Blockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in finance. With the characteristics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof, cryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization, Blockchain fits well with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data integrity, authenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is time to summarize the applications of Blockchain technology in the field of Supply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings to Supply Chain Finance is not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit disassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance operations through smart contracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in combination with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work in Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain Finance oriented applications, but most of these work are at the management level to propose conceptual frameworks or simply use Blockchain without exploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic reviews providing a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. In this paper, we ... |

However, despite their innovative appeal, these games face significant challenges, particularly in terms of market stability, player retention, and the sustainability of token value. This paper explores the evolution of blockchain games and identifies key shortcomings in current tokenomics models using entropy increase theory. We propose two new models - ServerFi, which emphasizes Privatization through Asset Synthesis, and a model focused on Continuous Rewards for High-Retention Players. These models are formalized into mathematical frameworks and validated through group behavior simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that the ServerFi is particularly effective in maintaining player engagement and ensuring the long-term viability of the gaming ecosystem, offering a promising direction for future blockchain game development. |
|**2024-08-16**|**Beyond Proportional Individual Guarantees for Binary Perpetual Voting**|Yotam Gafni et.al.|[2408.08767](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08767)| Perpetual voting studies fair collective decision-making in settings where many decisions are to be made, and is a natural framework for settings such as parliaments and the running of blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). We focus our attention on the binary case (YES/NO decisions) and \textit{individual} guarantees for each of the participating agents. We introduce a novel notion, inspired by the popular maxi-min-share (MMS) for fair allocation. The agent expects to get as many decisions as if they were to optimally partition the decisions among the agents, with an adversary deciding which of the agents decides on what bundle. We show an online algorithm that guarantees the MMS notion for $n=3$ agents, an offline algorithm for $n=4$ agents, and show that no online algorithm can guarantee the $MMS^{adapt}$ for $n\geq 7$ agents. We also show that the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) outcome can only guarantee $O(\frac{1}{n})$ of the MMS notion in the worst case. |
|**2024-08-16**|**Blockchain-Enabled Accountability in Data Supply Chain: A Data Bill of Materials Approach**|Yue Liu et.al.|[2408.08536](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08536)| In the era of advanced artificial intelligence, highlighted by large-scale generative models like GPT-4, ensuring the traceability, verifiability, and reproducibility of datasets throughout their lifecycle is paramount for research institutions and technology companies. These organisations increasingly rely on vast corpora to train and fine-tune advanced AI models, resulting in intricate data supply chains that demand effective data governance mechanisms. In addition, the challenge intensifies as diverse stakeholders may use assorted tools, often without adequate measures to ensure the accountability of data and the reliability of outcomes. In this study, we adapt the concept of ``Software Bill of Materials" into the field of data governance and management to address the above challenges, and introduce ``Data Bill of Materials" (DataBOM) to capture the dependency relationship between different datasets and stakeholders by storing specific metadata. We demonstrate a platform architecture for providing blockchain-based DataBOM services, present the interaction protocol for stakeholders, and discuss the minimal requirements for DataBOM metadata. The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of feasibility and performance via case study and quantitative analysis respectively. |

Backed by a decentralized blockchain architecture, the Web3 space aims to democratize all aspects of the web. From data-sharing to learning models, outsourcing computation is an established, prevalent practice. Verifiable computation makes this practice trustworthy as clients/users can now efficiently validate the integrity of a computation. As verifiable computation gets considered for applications in the Web3 space, decentralization is crucial for system reliability, ensuring that no single entity can suppress clients. At the same time, however, decentralization needs to be balanced with efficiency: clients want their computations done as quickly as possible.   Motivated by these issues, we study the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency when outsourcing computational tasks to strategic, rational solution providers. Specifically, we examine this trade-off when the client employs (1) revelation mechanisms, i.e. auctions, where solution providers bid their desired reward for completing the task by a specific deadline and then the client selects which of them will do the task and how much they will be rewarded, and (2) simple, non-revelation mechanisms, where the client commits to the set of rules she will use to map solutions at specific times to rewards and then solution providers decide whether they want to do the task or not. We completely characterize the power and limitations of revelation and non-revelation mechanisms in our model. |

Despite these barriers, FL enables these isolated data repositories to participate in collaborative learning without compromising privacy or security. Concurrently, the advancement of blockchain technology and decentralized applications (DApps) within Web 3.0 heralds a new era of transformative possibilities in web development. As such, incorporating FL into Web 3.0 paves the path for overcoming the limitations of data silos through collaborative learning. However, given the transaction speed constraints of core blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and the latency in smart contracts, employing one-shot FL, which minimizes client-server interactions in traditional FL to a single exchange, is considered more apt for Web 3.0 environments. This paper presents a practical one-shot FL system for Web 3.0, termed OFL-W3. OFL-W3 capitalizes on blockchain technology by utilizing smart contracts for managing transactions. Meanwhile, OFL-W3 utilizes the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) coupled with Flask communication, to facilitate backend server operations to use existing one-shot FL algorithms. With the integration of the incentive mechanism, OFL-W3 showcases an effective implementation of one-shot FL on Web 3.0, offering valuable insights and future directions for AI combined with Web 3.0 studies. |

However, the assurance of data permanency in IPFS relies on the pinning of data, which comes with trust issues and potential single points of failure. This paper introduces Verifiable Decentralized IPFS Clusters (VDICs) to enhance off-chain storage reliability with verifiable data permanency guarantees. VDICs leverage Decentralized Identifier, Verifiable Credentials, and IPFS Clusters to create a trustworthy ecosystem where the storage of pinned data is transparent and verifiable. Performance evaluations demonstrate that VDICs are competitive with traditional pinning services. Real-life use cases validate their feasibility and practicality for providers of Decentralized Applications focused on ensuring data permanency. |

This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains to perform large-scale FL computations. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution, and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes. |

With its inherent decentralization and immutability, blockchain offers itself as a potential solution for these requirements. However, the practicality of incorporating blockchain into real-time sensor data storage systems is a topic that demands in-depth examination. While blockchain promises unmatched data security and auditability, some intrinsic qualities, namely scalability restrictions, transactional delays, and escalating storage demands, impede its seamless deployment in high-frequency, voluminous data contexts typical of real-time sensors. This essay launches a methodical investigation into these difficulties, illuminating their underlying causes, potential effects, and potential countermeasures. In addition, we present a novel pragmatic experimental setup and analysis of blockchain for smart system applications, with an extended discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of deploying blockchain based solutions for smart system ecosystems. |

Building upon DIN's core principles, DHIN introduces healthcare-specific components to tackle data fragmentation across providers and institutions, establishing a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision. It facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse health data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR), extending DIN's personal data stores concept to ensure health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, tailored for medical data; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism adapted from DIN to incentivize participation in healthcare AI development. DHIN operates on a public blockchain with an immutable record, ensuring that no entity can control access to health data or determine financial benefits. It supports effective AI training while allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized ecosystem. Unique to DHIN, patients receive rewards in digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to fund decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage, showcasing how DIN principles can transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients. |

These shortcomings come from (1) that a smart contract is a computer program, not a document describing legal obligations, and (2) that blockchain-based systems are complicated to use and operate. In this paper, we present a refined and extended summary of our work taking key technologies from the blockchain sphere and applying them to the ricardian contract, which is a traditional contract in digital form with machine-readable parameters. By putting the ricardian contract in the context of our contract network architecture, we facilitate the infrastructure required for contracts to be offered, negotiated, performed, renegotiated and terminated in a completely digital and automatable fashion. Our architecture circumvents the legal issues of blockchains by facilitating an artifact very much alike a traditional contract, as well as its operational complexity by requiring consensus only between nodes representing directly involved parties. To demonstrate its utility, we also present how it could be used for (1) private data purchasing, (2) treasury management, (3) order-driven manufacturing and (4) automated device on-boarding. |

As a result, SC is seen as an important potential technology for future sixth-generation (6G) communications, solving the problem of lack of spectrum resources and energy inefficiency. Symbiotic relationships among communication systems can complement radio resources in 6G. However, the absence of established trust relationships among diverse communication systems presents a formidable hurdle in ensuring efficient and trusted resource and service exchange within SC frameworks. To better realize trusted SC services in 6G, in this paper, we propose a solution that converges SC and blockchain, called a symbiotic blockchain network (SBN). Specifically, we first use cognitive backscatter communication to transform blockchain consensus, that is, the symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC), so that it can be better suited for the wireless network. Then, for SBC, we propose a highly energy-efficient sharding scheme to meet the extremely low power consumption requirements in 6G. Finally, such a blockchain scheme guarantees trusted transactions of communication services in SC. Through ablation experiments, our proposed SBN demonstrates significant efficacy in mitigating energy consumption and reducing processing latency in adversarial networks, which is expected to achieve a sustainable and trusted 6G wireless network. |

We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. These insights provide practical guidance for governance decisions in blockchains. |

Over the years, several traceability heuristics have been proposed, most of which have been rendered ineffective with subsequent protocol upgrades. Between 2019 and 2023, Monero wallet application bugs "Differ By One" and "10 Block Decoy Bug" have been observed and identified and discussed in the Monero community. In addition, a decentralized mining pool named P2Pool has proliferated, and a controversial UTXO NFT imitation known as Mordinals has been tried for Monero. In this paper, we systematically describe the traceability heuristics that have emerged from these developments, and evaluate their quality based on ground truth, and through pairwise comparisons. We also explore the temporal perspective, and show which of these heuristics have been applicable over the past years, what fraction of decoys could be eliminated and what the remaining effective ring size is. Our findings illustrate that most of the heuristics have a high precision, that the "10 Block Decoy Bug" and the Coinbase decoy identification heuristics have had the most impact between 2019 and 2023, and that the former could be used to evaluate future heuristics, if they are also applicable during that time frame. |

They target system availability, compromising entire systems without breaking underlying security protocols. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on preventing, detecting, and mitigating DoS attacks. However, state-of-the-art systematization efforts have limitations such as isolated DoS countermeasures, shortcomings of AI-based studies, and a lack of DoS integration features like privacy, anonymity, authentication, and transparency. Additionally, the emergence of quantum computers is a game changer for DoS from attack and defense perspectives, yet it has remained largely unexplored. This study aims to address these gaps by examining (counter)-DoS in the AI era while also considering post-quantum (PQ) security when it applies. We highlight the deficiencies in the current literature and provide insights into synergistic techniques to bridge these gaps. We explore AI mechanisms for DoS intrusion detection, evaluate cybersecurity properties in cutting-edge machine learning models, and analyze weaponized AI in the context of DoS. We also investigate collaborative and distributed counter-DoS frameworks via federated learning and blockchains. Finally, we assess proactive approaches such as honeypots, puzzles, and authentication schemes that can be integrated into next-generation network systems for DoS prevention and mitigation. |

However, their unique structure challenges existing legal frameworks, especially concerning the liability of participants. This study focuses on analyzing the legal implications of the decentralized nature of DAOs, with a particular emphasis on the aspects of participant liability. Such considerations are essential for understanding how current legal systems might be adapted or reformed to effectively address these novel challenges.   The paper examines the specificity of DAOs, highlighting their decentralized governance structure and reliance on smart contracts, which introduce unique issues related to the blurring of liability boundaries. It underscores how the anonymity of DAO participants and the automatic execution of smart contracts complicate the traditional concept of legal liability, both within the DAO context and in interactions with external parties.   The analysis also includes a comparison between DAOs and traditional organizational forms, such as corporations and associations, to identify potential analogies and differences in participant liability. It explores how existing regulations on partner liability might be insufficient or inapplicable in the DAO context, prompting the search for new, innovative legal solutions. |

Nevertheless, their widespread adoption introduces numerous challenges, including issues related to academic integrity, copyright, environmental impacts, and ethical considerations such as data bias, fairness, and privacy.

In this dynamic environment, users' tasks frequently shift, requiring fast model personalization despite limited data. This evolution consumes extensive resources and requires vast data volumes. To address this, meta-learning emerges as an invaluable tool for metaverse users, with federated meta-learning (FML), offering even more tailored solutions owing to its adaptive capabilities. However, the metaverse is characterized by users heterogeneity with diverse data structures, varied tasks, and uneven sample sizes, potentially undermining global training outcomes due to statistical difference. Given this, an urgent need arises for smart coalition formation that accounts for these disparities. This paper introduces a dual game-theoretic framework for metaverse services involving meta-learners as workers to manage FML. A blockchain-based cooperative coalition formation game is crafted, grounded on a reputation metric, user similarity, and incentives. We also introduce a novel reputation system based on users' historical contributions and potential contributions to present tasks, leveraging correlations between past and new tasks. Finally, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is presented to attract reliable workers to participate in meta-learning, minimizing users' energy costs, increasing payoffs, boosting FML efficacy, and improving metaverse utility. Results show that our dual game framework outperforms best-effort, random, and non-uniform clustering schemes - improving training performance by up to 10%, cutting completion times by as much as 30%, enhancing metaverse utility by more than 25%, and offering up to 5% boost in training efficiency over non-blockchain systems, effectively countering misbehaving users. |

Overseeing the XDC network is currently the XDC Foundation, a non-profit organization established to encourage the growth, enhancement, and adoption of the XDC Network through community-driven projects such as GitHub. This whitepaper discusses the real-time assessment of the XDC network's decentralization, scalability, and security aspects as well as the Nakamoto coefficient estimation that follows, which is a measure of a decentralized system's decentralization nature that quantifies the minimal number of nodes or entities needed to compromise the system. A high coefficient denotes greater decentralization, while a low number denotes increased disruption risk. The XDC network's real-time computation of the high Nakamoto coefficient demonstrates its highly decentralized character. The article also addresses the diversity of consensus and execution clients, the host distribution, the geo-distribution, and some of the outstanding issues and business considerations. |

The study evaluates the network's decentralization, scalability, and security features, including its Nakamoto coefficient, validator participation, and client distribution. Additionally, it examines the developer ecosystem, including GitHub metrics, and business aspects such as transaction costs and predictability. The findings of this research will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the XDC Network, informing stakeholders and decision-makers about its suitability for various use cases, particularly in trade finance, asset tokenization, and enterprise blockchain solutions. |
|**2024-08-04**|**Secure and Transparent Medical Record Management System Using Python and Blockchain**|Atchiyya Naidu Chitikela et.al.|[2408.02081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02081)| In this paper, we propose a robust health record storage and management system built on blockchain technology to address the challenges faced by traditional healthcare record systems. The primary advantage of employing blockchain in healthcare record management is its ability to provide a secure and decentralized platform. Unlike traditional centralized databases, where a single point of failure can compromise data integrity and security, blockchain distributes data across a network of nodes, ensuring redundancy and resilience against cyber-attacks. This distributed nature of blockchain enhances data security and privacy, crucial considerations when dealing with sensitive health information. Central to our proposed system is the utilization of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts automate processes related to health record management, such as data access, sharing, and updating, based on predefined permissions and protocols. This automation not only streamlines administrative tasks but also reduces the risk of human errors and ensures data accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, our system prioritizes patient empowerment by granting individuals complete control over their health records. Patients can securely access and manage their data using cryptographic keys, granting permission to healthcare providers or other authorized entities as needed. Overall, our proposed health record storage and management system on the blockchain offer significant advantages over traditional systems, including enhanced security, data integrity, transparency, and patient control. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, healthcare organizations can revolutionize their record management practices, and maintaining secure ecosystems. |

Nevertheless, facilitating secure, efficient and scalable sharing continues to pose a pivotal challenge. Emerging as a promising technology to bridge the trust gap among multiple participants, blockchain has been envisioned to enable DSS in a decentralized manner. However, satellites with limited resources may struggle to support the frequent interactions required by blockchain networks. Additionally,given the extensive coverage of satellites, spectrum sharing needs vary by regions, challenging traditional blockchain approaches to accommodate differences. In this work, a partitioned, self-governed, and customized dynamic spectrum sharing approach (PSC-DSS) is proposed for spectrum sharing between satellite access networks and terrestrial access networks. This approach establishes a sharded and tiered architecture which allows various regions to manage spectrum autonomously while jointly maintaining a single blockchain ledger. Moreover, a spectrum-consensus integrated mechanism, which decouples DSS process and couples it with blockchain consensus protocol, is designed to enable regions to conduct DSS transactions in parallel and dynamically innovate spectrum sharing schemes without affecting others. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is derived to justify the stability performance of PSC-DSS. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the advantageous performance of PSC-DSS in terms of low-overhead, high efficiency, and robust stability. |
|**2024-12-04**|**Remote Staking with Optimal Economic Safety**|Xinshu Dong et.al.|[2408.01896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01896)| Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains require validators to lock their tokens as collateral, slashing these tokens if they are identified as protocol violators. PoS chains have mostly been secured by their native tokens. However, using only the native token upper-bounds the value eligible for staking by the market capitalization of the native token. In contrast, the remote staking of another crypto asset from a provider chain provides an avenue to improve the consumer chain's economic security. In this paper, we present the first known remote staking protocols with guaranteed optimal economic safety: whenever there is a safety violation on the consumer chain, at least one third of the provider's stake securing the consumer chain is slashed. To achieve this goal for a broad range of provider and consumer chains, two independent contributions are made: 1) a cryptographic protocol to slash stake even without smart contracts on the provider chain; 2) a secure unbonding protocol that ensures slashing before the stake is unbonded on the provider chain if there is safety violation on the consumer chain. A major use case of this work is when the provider chain is Bitcoin, making available an asset worth more than 1.7 trillion USD to secure PoS chains. Such a Bitcoin staking protocol has been launched on the Mainnet in August 2024 and has accumulated 2.1 billion USD worth of stake thus far. |
|**2024-09-19**|**Blockchain Amplification Attack**|Taro Tsuchiya et.al.|[2408.01508](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01508)| Strategies related to the blockchain concept of Extractable Value (MEV/BEV), such as arbitrage, front- or backrunning create an economic incentive for network nodes to reduce latency. A modified node, that minimizes transaction validation time and neglects to filter invalid transactions in the Ethereum P2P network, introduces a novel attack vector -- Blockchain Amplification Attack. An attacker exploits those modified nodes to amplify an invalid transaction thousands of times, posing a threat to the entire network. To illustrate attack feasibility and practicality in the current mainnet, we 1) identify thousands of similar attacks in the wild, 2) mathematically model propagation mechanism, 3) empirically measure model parameters from our two monitoring nodes, and 4) compare performance with existing Denial-of-Service attacks through local simulation. We show that an attacker can amplify network traffic at modified nodes by a factor of 3,600, and cause economic damages 13,800 times greater than the amount needed to carry out the attack. Despite these risks, aggressive latency reduction may still be profitable enough to justify the existence of modified nodes. To assess this tradeoff, we 1) simulate the transaction validation process in the local network and 2) empirically measure the latency reduction by deploying our modified node in the Ethereum testnet. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis of skipping validation and provide mitigation strategies against this attack. |

These descriptions help reviewers and fellow developers quickly understand the updates. Despite their importance, some developers omit these descriptions. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated method for generating PR descriptions based on commit messages and source code comments. This method frames the task as a text summarization problem, for which we utilized the T5 text-to-text transfer model. We fine-tuned a pre-trained T5 model using a dataset containing 33,466 PRs. The model's effectiveness was assessed using ROUGE metrics, which are recognized for their strong alignment with human evaluations. Our findings reveal that the T5 model significantly outperforms LexRank, which served as our baseline for comparison. |
|**2024-08-01**|**Enhancing Ethereum Fraud Detection via Generative and Contrastive Self-supervision**|Chenxiang Jin et.al.|[2408.00641](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00641)| The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations. However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the interaction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive module significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different behavior patterns. The source code will be released on GitHub soon. |

ZKPs have unique advantages in terms of universality and minimal security assumptions when compared to other privacy-sensitive computational methods for distributed systems, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Their application spans multiple domains, from enhancing privacy in blockchain to facilitating confidential verification of computational tasks. This survey starts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a focus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there have been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our work is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and describing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains. These application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and interoperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting, authentication, timelocks, and machine learning. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, the survey also covers foundational components and infrastructure such as zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM), domain-specific languages (DSLs), supporting libraries, frameworks, and protocols. We conclude with a discussion on future directions, positioning ZKPs as pivotal in the advancement of cryptographic practices and digital privacy across many applications. |

However, AI's complex nature makes understanding and fixing problems challenging. Research worldwide shows that a parent's income greatly influences a child's education. This led us to explore how AI, especially complex models, makes important decisions using Explainable AI tools. Our research uncovered many complexities linked to parental income and offered reasonable explanations for these decisions. However, we also found biases in AI that go against what we want from AI in education: clear transparency and equal access for everyone. These biases can impact families and children's schooling, highlighting the need for better AI solutions that offer fair opportunities to all. This chapter tries to shed light on the complex ways AI operates, especially concerning biases. These are the foundational steps towards better educational policies, which include using AI in ways that are more reliable, accountable, and beneficial for everyone involved. |

In response to these transformative shifts, this paper proposes a service and resource discovery architecture as part of service provisioning for the future 6G edge-cloud-continuum. Through the architecture's orchestration and platform components, users will have access to services efficiently and on time. Blockchain underpins trust in this inherently trustless environment, while semantic networking dynamically extracts context from service requests, fostering efficient communication and service delivery. A key innovation lies in dynamic overlay zoning, which not only optimizes resource allocation but also endows our architecture with scalability, adaptability, and resilience. Notably, our architecture excels at predictive capabilities, harnessing learning algorithms to anticipate user and service instance behavior, thereby enhancing network responsiveness and preserving service continuity. This comprehensive architecture paves the way for unparalleled resource optimization, latency reduction, and seamless service delivery, positioning it as an instrumental pillar in the unfolding 6G landscape. Simulation results show that our architecture provides near-optimal timely responses that significantly improve the network's potential, offering scalable and efficient service and resource discovery. |

Solutions for health data management, as in storing it, sharing and processing it, are emerging quickly and were significantly boosted by the Covid-19 pandemic that created a need to move things online. EHRs makes a crucial part of digital identity data, and the same digital identity trends -- as in self sovereign identity powered by decentralized ledger technologies like Blockchain, are being researched or implemented in contexts managing digital interactions between health facilities, patients and health professionals. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution enabling secure exchange of EHRs between different parties powered by a self-sovereign identity (SSI) wallet and decentralized identifiers. We also make use of a consortium IPFS network for off-chain storage and attribute-based encryption (ABE) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Through our solution, we grant users full control over their medical data, and enable them to securely share it in total confidentiality over secure communication channels between user wallets using encryption. We also use DIDs for better user privacy and limit any possible correlations or identification by using pairwise DIDs. Overall, combining this set of technologies guarantees secure exchange of EHRs, secure storage and management along with by-design features inherited from the technological stack. |

Validators take effort to verify the validity of the announcements, gaining rewards for successfully challenging invalid ones, while receiving nothing for valid ones. Optimistic Rollup, a Layer 2 blockchain scaling solution, exemplifies such games, offering significant improvements in transaction throughput and cost efficiency. We present a game-theoretic model of announcement games to analyze the potential behaviors of announcers and validators. We identify all Nash equilibria and study the corresponding system losses for different Nash equilibria. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various system parameters on system loss under the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we provide suggestions for mechanism optimization to reduce system losses. |

However, this kind of enhancement is only significant on monolithic architectures, and when it runs on large-scale distributed training, data security and privacy issues will be reconsidered, and its prediction performance is unknown. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework: FedBChain, which integrates the federated learning paradigm based on a modified DeepConvLSTM architecture with a single LSTM layer. This framework performs comparative tests of prediction performance on three different real-world datasets based on three different hidden layer units (128, 256, and 512) combined with five different federated learning strategies, respectively. The results show that our architecture has significant improvements in Precision, Recall and F1-score compared to the centralized training approach on all datasets with all hidden layer units for all strategies: FedAvg strategy improves on average by 4.54%, FedProx improves on average by 4.57%, FedTrimmedAvg improves on average by 4.35%, Krum improves by 4.18% on average, and FedAvgM improves by 4.46% on average. Based on our results, it can be seen that FedBChain not only improves in performance, but also guarantees the security and privacy of user data compared to centralized training methods during the training process. The code for our experiments is publicly available (https://github.com/Glen909/FedBChain). |

However, traditional centralized approaches for machine learning in VANETs raise concerns about data privacy and security. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. This paper proposes FL-DECO-BC as a novel privacy-preserving, provably secure, and provenance-preserving federated learning framework specifically designed for VANETs. FL-DECO-BC leverages decentralized oracles on blockchain to securely access external data sources while ensuring data privacy through advanced techniques. The framework guarantees provable security through cryptographic primitives and formal verification methods. Furthermore, FL-DECO-BC incorporates a provenance-preserving design to track data origin and history, fostering trust and accountability. This combination of features empowers VANETs with secure and privacy-conscious machine-learning capabilities, paving the way for advanced traffic management and safety applications. |

However, blockchains operate in a decentralized manner and the network is composed of diverse users. This openness creates the potential for malicious nodes to disrupt the network in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to embed a mechanism within the blockchain network to constantly monitor, identify, and eliminate these malicious nodes without involving any central authority. In this paper, we propose MRL-PoS+, a novel consensus algorithm to enhance the security of PoS blockchains by leveraging Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MRL) techniques. Our proposed consensus algorithm introduces a penalty-reward scheme for detecting and eliminating malicious nodes. This approach involves the detection of behaviors that can lead to potential attacks in a blockchain network and hence penalizes the malicious nodes, restricting them from performing certain actions. Our developed Proof of Concept demonstrates effectiveness in eliminating malicious nodes for six types of major attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that MRL-PoS+ significantly improves the attack resilience of PoS blockchains compared to the traditional schemes without incurring additional computation overhead. |

In this paper, we explore the impact of conflicting transactions on blockchain attack vectors. Through modeling and simulation, we delve into the dynamics of four pivotal attacks - block withholding, double spending, balance, and distributed denial of service (DDoS), all orchestrated using conflicting transactions. Our analysis not only focuses on the mechanisms through which these attacks exploit transaction conflicts but also underscores their potential impact on the integrity and reliability of blockchain networks. Additionally, we propose a set of countermeasures for mitigating these attacks. Through implementation and evaluation, we show their effectiveness in lowering attack rates and enhancing overall network performance seamlessly, without introducing additional overhead. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of actively managing conflicting transactions to reinforce blockchain security and performance. |

By facilitating offchain execution of transactions, PCNs significantly reduce the burden on the blockchain, leading to faster transaction processing, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced privacy. Despite these advantages, the current state-of-the-art in PCNs presents a variety of challenges that require further exploration. In this paper, we survey several fundamental aspects of PCNs, such as pathfinding and routing, virtual channels, state channels, payment channel hubs, and rebalancing protocols. We aim to provide the reader with a detailed understanding of the various aspects of PCN research, highlighting important advancements. Additionally, we highlight the various unresolved challenges in this area. Specifically, this paper seeks to answer the following crucial question: What are the various interesting and non-trivial challenges in fundamental infrastructure design leading to efficient transaction processing in PCN research that require immediate attention from the academic and research community? By addressing this question, we aim to identify the most pressing problems and future research directions, and we hope to inspire researchers and practitioners to tackle these challenges to make PCNs more secure and versatile |

About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform driven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. Access over ownership is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are also changing the rules of the game. One of such technologies challenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework concerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies.

However, recent studies indicate that LLMs face numerous vulnerabilities, including data poisoning, prompt injections, and unauthorized data exposure, which conventional methods have struggled to address fully. In parallel, blockchain technology, known for its data immutability and decentralized structure, offers a promising foundation for safeguarding LLMs. In this survey, we aim to comprehensively assess how to leverage blockchain technology to enhance LLMs' security and safety. Besides, we propose a new taxonomy of blockchain for large language models (BC4LLMs) to systematically categorize related works in this emerging field. Our analysis includes novel frameworks and definitions to delineate security and safety in the context of BC4LLMs, highlighting potential research directions and challenges at this intersection. Through this study, we aim to stimulate targeted advancements in blockchain-integrated LLM security. |

The growing adoption of cloud services by companies, accompanied by increased threats from cybersecurity, highlights the importance of privacy and ownership of user data. Between 2022 and 2023, there has been an increase of around 48% in cloud security threats, emphasizing the urgent need for strong security solutions. To face these challenges, in this project, we propose integrating the Ethereum network's blockchain technology with a database located in the PostgreSQL cloud. The proposed solution aims to provide bidirectional data synchronization and strict control of access mechanisms. Blockchain technology ensures immutability and transparency of transactions, while PostgreSQL provides efficient and scalable storage. Through rigorous testing in an adaptive traffic control scenario, the results obtained indicate that this solution offers a significantly high level of security due to the decentralization of data, confirming that this solution is effective, and making it a powerful new option to improve security in cloud environments. In conclusion, the solution proposed in this project not only increases information security but also demonstrates the practical feasibility of integrating blockchain with cloud relational databases. This two-way alignment improves protection against cyberattacks and ensures that user data is protected from unauthorized access and malicious changes. |

This research topic has been active and extensively studied over the last four decades, particularly since the advent of blockchain technology in 2009. Blockchain technology employs Proof-of-X (PoX) or Byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) systems, where all participants follow a protocol to achieve a common state (i.e., consistency) eventually. However, because PoX consensus such as Proof-of-Work is is resource-intensive with high power consumption, most permissioned blockchains employ BFT to achieve consistency. In this article, we provide an introduction to the fundamental principles and history of distributed consensus. We then explore the well-known fault-tolerant state machine replication (SMR) in partially synchronous networks, as well as consensus protocols in asynchronous models and recently proposed DAG-based consensus. Additionally, we examine the relationship between BFT consensus and blockchain technology and discuss the following questions: What is the history and evolution of BFT? Why are BFT protocols designed in the way they are and what core components do they use? What is the connection between BFT and blockchain technology, and what are the driving needs for future BFT research? |

Traditional centralized architectures often struggle to meet required data security and scalability needs which hinders the democratization of AI systems. Nesa introduces a model-agnostic sharding framework designed for decentralized AI inference. Our framework uses blockchain-based sequential deep neural network sharding to distribute computational tasks across a diverse network of nodes based on a personalised heuristic and routing mechanism. This enables efficient distributed training and inference for recent large-scale models even on consumer-grade hardware. We use compression techniques like dynamic blockwise quantization and mixed matrix decomposition to reduce data transfer and memory needs. We also integrate robust security measures, including hardware-based trusted execution environments to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Evaluating our system across various natural language processing and vision tasks shows that these compression strategies do not compromise model accuracy. Our results highlight the potential to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technologies by enabling secure and efficient inference on a decentralized network. |

However, it encounters challenges in managing conflicting transactions that negatively affect throughput and latency. This paper proposes a novel solution to address these challenges and improve performance, especially in applications incorporating extensive volumes of highly conflicting transactions. Our solution involves reallocating the Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) of the validation phase to a preceding stage in the transaction flow to enable early detection of conflicting transactions. Specifically, we propose and evaluate two innovative modifications, called Orderer Early MVCC (OEMVCC) and OEMVCC with Execution Avoidance (OEMVCC-EA). Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate significant throughput and latency improvements, providing a practical solution for high-conflict applications that demand high performance and scalability. |

MEV arises when miners or validators manipulate transaction ordering to extract additional value, often at the expense of other network participants. This not only affects user experience by introducing unpredictability and potential financial losses but also threatens the underlying principles of decentralization and trust. Given the growing complexity of blockchain applications, particularly with the increase of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, addressing MEV is crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MEV mitigation techniques as applied to both Ethereums L1 and various L2 solutions. We provide a novel categorization of mitigation strategies; we also describe the challenges, ranging from transaction sequencing and cryptographic methods to reconfiguring decentralized applications (DApps) to reduce front-running opportunities. We investigate their effectiveness, implementation challenges, and impact on network performance. By synthesizing current research, real-world applications, and emerging trends, this paper aims to provide a detailed roadmap for researchers, developers, and policymakers to understand and combat MEV in an evolving blockchain landscape. |

Ethereum relies on in-protocol incentives, like rewards for validators delivering correct and timely votes, to induce honest behavior and secure the blockchain. However, external incentives, such as the block proposer's opportunity to capture maximal extractable value (MEV), may tempt validators to deviate from honest protocol participation.   We show a series of commitment attacks on LMD GHOST, a core part of Ethereum's consensus mechanism. We demonstrate how a single adversarial block proposer can orchestrate long-range chain reorganizations by manipulating Ethereum's reward system for timely votes. These attacks disrupt the intended balance of power between proposers and voters: by leveraging credible threats, the adversarial proposer can coerce voters from previous slots into supporting blocks that conflict with the honest chain, enabling a chain reorganization at no cost to the adversary. In response, we introduce a novel reward mechanism that restores the voters' role as a check against proposer power. Our proposed mitigation is fairer and more decentralized -- not only in the context of these attacks -- but also practical for implementation in Ethereum. |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy. |

This is especially true when it comes to Layer~2 (L2) ecosystems, and ZKsync, in particular. To address these issues, we have curated a dataset from 1 year of activity extracted from a ZKsync Era archive node and made it freely available to external parties. In this paper, we provide details on this dataset and how it was created, showcase a few example analyses that can be performed with it, and discuss some future research directions. We also publish and share the code used in our analysis on GitHub to promote reproducibility and to support further research. |

However, their adoption is hindered by security vulnerabilities that can result in significant financial losses. Most vulnerability detection tools and methods available nowadays leverage either static analysis methods or machine learning. Unfortunately, as valuable as they are, both approaches suffer from limitations that make them only partially effective. In this survey, we analyze the state of the art in machine-learning vulnerability detection for Ethereum smart contracts, by categorizing existing tools and methodologies, evaluating them, and highlighting their limitations. Our critical assessment unveils issues such as restricted vulnerability coverage and dataset construction flaws, providing us with new metrics to overcome the difficulties that restrain a sound comparison of existing solutions. Driven by our findings, we discuss best practices to enhance the accuracy, scope, and efficiency of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Our guidelines address the known flaws while at the same time opening new avenues for research and development. By shedding light on current challenges and offering novel directions for improvement, we contribute to the advancement of secure smart contract development and blockchain technology as a whole. |

Recently, the incorporation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) methods has provided new possibilities for improving privacy, augmenting data, and customizing models. This research explores potential integrations of generative AI in federated learning, revealing various opportunities to enhance privacy, data efficiency, and model performance. It particularly emphasizes the importance of generative models like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) in creating synthetic data that replicates the distribution of real data. Generating synthetic data helps federated learning address challenges related to limited data availability and supports robust model development. Additionally, we examine various applications of generative AI in federated learning that enable more personalized solutions. |

This represents a research challenge that we aim to address in this paper. We systematically analysed recent literature to identify privacy threats in FL within IoT environments, and evaluate the defensive measures that can be employed to mitigate these threats. Using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, we searched five publication databases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, ACM, and Science Direct), collating relevant papers published between 2017 and April 2024, a period which spans from the introduction of FL until now. Guided by the PRISMA protocol, we selected 49 papers to focus our systematic review on. We analysed these papers, paying special attention to the privacy threats and defensive measures -- specifically within the context of IoT -- using inclusion and exclusion criteria tailored to highlight recent advances and critical insights. We identified various privacy threats, including inference attacks, poisoning attacks, and eavesdropping, along with defensive measures such as Differential Privacy and Secure Multi-Party Computation. These defences were evaluated for their effectiveness in protecting privacy without compromising the functional integrity of FL in IoT settings. Our review underscores the necessity for robust and efficient privacy-preserving strategies tailored for IoT environments. Notably, there is a need for strategies against replay, evasion, and model stealing attacks. Exploring lightweight defensive measures and emerging technologies such as blockchain may help improve the privacy of FL in IoT, leading to the creation of FL models that can operate under variable network conditions. |

DAS, a pivotal concept in blockchain technology and decentralized networks, is thoroughly examined to unravel its intricacies and assess its impact on system performance. Through the development of a simulator tailored explicitly for DAS, we embark on a comprehensive investigation into the parameters that influence system behavior and efficiency. A series of experiments are conducted within the simulated environment to validate theoretical formulations and dissect the interplay of DAS parameters. This includes an exploration of approaches such as custody by row, variations in validators per node, and malicious nodes. The outcomes of these experiments furnish insights into the efficacy of DAS protocols and pave the way for the formulation of optimization strategies geared towards enhancing decentralized network performance. Moreover, the findings serve as guidelines for future research endeavors, offering a nuanced understanding of the complexities inherent in decentralized systems. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of DAS but also offers practical implications for the design, implementation, and optimization of decentralized systems. |
|**2024-07-25**|**An Exploration Study on Developing Blockchain Systems the Practitioners Perspective**|Bakheet Aljedaani et.al.|[2407.18005](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18005)| Context: Blockchain-based software (BBS) exploits the concepts and technologies popularized by cryptocurrencies offering decentralized transaction ledgers with immutable content for security-critical and transaction critical systems. Recent research has explored the strategic benefits and technical limitations of BBS in various fields, including cybersecurity, healthcare, education, and financial technologies. Despite growing interest from academia and industry, there is a lack of empirical evidence, leading to an incomplete understanding of the processes, methods, and techniques necessary for systematic BBS development. Objectives: Existing research lacks a consolidated view, particularly empirically driven guidelines based on published evidence and development practices. This study aims to address the gap by consolidating empirical evidence and development practices to derive or leverage existing processes, patterns, and models for designing, implementing, and validating BBS systems. Method: Tied to this knowledge gap, we conducted a two-phase research project. First, a systematic literature review of 58 studies was performed to identify a development process comprising 23 tasks for BBS systems. Second, a survey of 102 blockchain practitioners from 35 countries across six continents was conducted to validate the BBS system development process. Results: Our results revealed a statistically significant difference (p-value <.001) in the importance ratings of 24 out of 26 BBS tasks by our participants. The only two tasks that were not statistically significant were incentive protocol design and granularity design. Conclusion: Our research is among the first to advance understanding on the aspect of development process for blockchain-based systems and helps researchers and practitioners in their quests on challenges and recommendations associated with the development of BBS systems |

However, the recent Tron-Steem takeover incident poses a significant threat to this vision. In this paper, we present a thorough empirical analysis of the Tron-Steem takeover incident. By conducting a fine-grained reconstruction of the stake and election snapshots within the Steem blockchain, one of the most prominent social-oriented blockchains, we quantify the marked shifts in decentralization pre and post the takeover incident, highlighting the severe threat that blockchain network takeovers pose to the decentralization principle of Web 3.0. Moreover, by employing heuristic methods to identify anomalous voters and conducting clustering analyses on voter behaviors, we unveil the underlying mechanics of takeover strategies employed in the Tron-Steem incident and suggest potential mitigation strategies, which contribute to the enhanced resistance of Web 3.0 networks against similar threats in the future. We believe the insights gleaned from this research help illuminate the challenges imposed by blockchain network takeovers in the Web 3.0 era, suggest ways to foster the development of decentralized technologies and governance, as well as to enhance the protection of Web 3.0 user rights. |
|**2024-07-25**|**Utilizing Blockchain and Smart Contracts for Enhanced Fraud Prevention and Minimization in Health Insurance through Multi-Signature Claim Processing**|Md Al Amin et.al.|[2407.17765](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17765)| Healthcare insurance provides financial support to access medical services for patients while ensuring timely and guaranteed payment for providers. Insurance fraud poses a significant challenge to insurance companies and policyholders, leading to increased costs and compromised healthcare treatment and service delivery. Most frauds, like phantom billing, upcoding, and unbundling, happen due to the lack of required entity participation. Also, claim activities are not transparent and accountable. Fraud can be prevented and minimized by involving every entity and making actions transparent and accountable. This paper proposes a blockchain-powered smart contract-based insurance claim processing mechanism to prevent and minimize fraud in response to this prevailing issue. All entities patients, providers, and insurance companies actively participate in the claim submission, approval, and acknowledgment process through a multi-signature technique. Also, every activity is captured and recorded in the blockchain using smart contracts to make every action transparent and accountable so that no entity can deny its actions and responsibilities. Blockchains' immutable storage property and strong integrity guarantee that recorded activities are not modified. As healthcare systems and insurance companies continue to deal with fraud challenges, this proposed approach holds the potential to significantly reduce fraudulent activities, ultimately benefiting both insurers and policyholders. |
|**2024-07-25**|**Towards the Blockchain Massive Adoption with Permissionless Storage**|Jia Kan et.al.|[2407.17761](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17761)| Blockchain technology emerged with the advent of Bitcoin and rapidly developed over the past few decades, becoming widely accepted and known by the public. However, in the past decades, the massive adoption of blockchain technology has yet to come. Rather than the scalability issue, the blockchain application is challenged by its expensive usage cost. However, the high cost of blockchain usage is deeply connected with the blockchain consensus and security mechanism. The permissionless blockchain must maintain its high cost for security against the 51% Attack. Chain users indirectly cover the cost as coins are appointed for blockchain usage fees. This conflict prevents the massive adoption of blockchain. Thus, blockchain must be improved to solve those problems: 1. The cost of blockchain usage should be low enough. 2. The blockchain should remain decentralized. 3. The scalability of blockchain must meet the demand.   In my thesis, new approaches are applied to solve the issues above. The key contribution is the discovery of the useful PoW. It extends the Nakamoto PoW with another usage of file data encoding during the same Nakamoto Consensus computation to prove honest data preservation. Based on this theory, a permissionless storage network is proposed as the new security engine for the blockchain. It bridges the high blockchain security cost to the storage users with real demands who are willing to pay for the storage resource. On the other hand, the chain users can benefit from the low transaction fee. Meanwhile, we also provide a scalability solution to shard the blockchain. It enables high TPS and keeps decentralization. The solutions in this thesis provide the answers to all the dependencies of the massive adoption. |
|**2024-07-25**|**SOK: Blockchain for Provenance**|Asma Jodeiri Akbarfam et.al.|[2407.17699](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17699)| Provenance, which traces data from its creation to manipulation, is crucial for ensuring data integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is valuable for single-user applications, collaboration within organizations, and across organizations. Blockchain technology has become a popular choice for implementing provenance due to its distributed, transparent, and immutable nature. Numerous studies on blockchain designs are specifically dedicated to provenance, and specialize in this area. Our goal is to provide a new perspective in blockchain based provenance field by identifying the challenges faced and suggesting future research directions. In this paper, we categorize the problem statement into three main research questions to investigate key issues comprehensively and propose a new outlook on the use of blockchains. The first focuses on challenges in non-collaborative, single-source environments, the second examines implications in collaborative environments and different domains such as supply chain, scientific collaboration and digital forensic, and the last one analyzes communication and data exchange challenges between organizations using different blockchains. The interconnected nature of these research questions ensures a thorough exploration of provenance requirements, leading to more effective and secure systems. After analyzing the requirements of provenance in different environments, we provide future design considerations for provenance-based blockchains, including blockchain type, query mechanisms, provenance capture methods, and domain-specific considerations. We also discuss future work and possible extensions in this field. |

A Systematic Review on On-Chain Identity**|Awid Vaziry et.al.|[2407.17276](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17276)| The ongoing regulation of blockchain-based services and applications requires the identification of users who are issuing transactions on the blockchain. This systematic review explores the current status, identifies research gaps, and outlines future research directions for establishing trusted and privacy-compliant identities on the blockchain (on-chain identity). A systematic search term was applied across various scientific databases, collecting 2232 potentially relevant research papers. These papers were narrowed down in two methodologically executed steps to 98 and finally to 13 relevant sources. The relevant articles were then systematically analyzed based on a set of screening questions. The results of the selected studies have provided insightful findings on the mechanisms of on-chain identities. On-chain identities are established using zero-knowledge proofs, public key infrastructure/certificates, and web of trust approaches. The technologies and architectures used by the authors are also highlighted. Trust has emerged as a key research gap, manifesting in two ways: firstly, a gap in how to trust the digital identity representation of a physical human; secondly, a gap in how to trust identity providers that issue identity confirmations on-chain. Potential future research avenues are suggested to help fill the current gaps in establishing trust and on-chain identities. |

The concept was first popularized in Algorand [CM19], who also observed that the protocol might be manipulable. [FHWY22] provide a concrete manipulation that is strictly profitable for a staker of any size (and also prove upper bounds on the gains from manipulation).   Separately, [YSZ23, BM24] initiate the study of undetectable profitable manipulations of consensus protocols with a focus on the seminal Selfish Mining strategy [ES14] for Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work longest-chain protocol. They design a Selfish Mining variant that, for sufficiently large miners, is strictly profitable yet also indistinguishable to an onlooker from routine latency (that is, a sufficiently large profit-maximizing miner could use their strategy to strictly profit over being honest in a way that still appears to the rest of the network as though everyone is honest but experiencing mildly higher latency. This avoids any risk of negatively impacting the value of the underlying cryptocurrency due to attack detection).   We investigate the detectability of profitable manipulations of the canonical cryptographic self-selection leader selection protocol introduced in [CM19] and studied in [FHWY22], and establish that for any player with $\alpha < \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.38$ fraction of the total stake, every strictly profitable manipulation is statistically detectable. Specifically, we consider an onlooker who sees only the random seed of each round (and does not need to see any other broadcasts by any other players). We show that the distribution of the sequence of random seeds when any player is profitably manipulating the protocol is inconsistent with any distribution that could arise by honest stakers being offline or timing out (for a natural stylized model of honest timeouts). |
|**2024-07-23**|**Blockchain security for ransomware detection**|Elodie Ngoie Mutombo et.al.|[2407.16862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16862)| Blockchain networks are critical for safeguarding digital transactions and assets, but they are increasingly targeted by ransomware attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Traditional detection techniques struggle due to the complexity of these exploits and the lack of comprehensive datasets. The UGRansome dataset addresses this gap by offering detailed features for analysing ransomware and zero-day attacks, including timestamps, attack types, protocols, network flows, and financial impacts in bitcoins (BTC). This study uses the Lazy Predict library to automate machine learning (ML) on the UGRansome dataset. The study aims to enhance blockchain security through ransomware detection based on zero-day exploit recognition using the UGRansome dataset. Lazy Predict streamlines different ML model comparisons and identifies effective algorithms for threat detection. Key features such as timestamps, protocols, and financial data are used to predict anomalies as zero-day threats and to classify known signatures as ransomware. Results demonstrate that ML can significantly improve cybersecurity in blockchain environments. The DecisionTreeClassifier and ExtraTreeClassifier, with their high performance and low training times, are ideal candidates for deployment in real-time threat detection systems. |

It contributes to a vast majority of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Nigeria but as ironic as it may be, there is still hunger in significant parts of the country due to low productivity in the agricultural sector and comparison to the geometric population growth. During the first half of 2022, agriculture contributed about 23% of the country's GDP while the industry and services sector had a share of the remaining 77%. This showed that with the high rate of agricultural activities, Nigeria has not achieved food security for the teeming population. and more productivity levels can be attained. Technology can/will assist Nigeria in overcoming global poverty and hunger quicker in both rural and urban areas. Today, there are many types of agricultural technologies available for farmers all over the world to increase productivity. Major technological advancements include indoor vertical farming, automation, robotics, livestock technology, modern greenhouse practices, precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Mobile phones have one of the highest adoption rates of technologies developed within the last century. Digitalization will bring consumers and farmers closer together to access the shortest supply chain possible and reduce rural poverty and hunger. The paper will review the different agricultural technologies and propose a mobile solution, code Sell Harvest, to make farming more sustainable and secure food.   Keywords: Sell Harvest, Agriculture, Technology, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Farming. |

To guarantee security, the mining rate of the blockchain is determined by the miners with the lowest bandwidth, resulting in an inefficient bandwidth utilization among fast miners. We propose Manifoldchain, an innovative blockchain sharding protocol that alleviates the impact of slow miners to maximize blockchain throughput. Manifoldchain utilizes a bandwidth-clustered shard formation mechanism that groups miners with similar bandwidths into the same shard. Consequently, this approach enables us to set an optimal mining rate for each shard based on its bandwidth, effectively reducing the waiting time caused by slow miners. Nevertheless, the adversary could corrupt miners with similar bandwidths, thereby concentrating hashing power and potentially creating an adversarial majority within a single shard. To counter this adversarial strategy, we introduce sharing mining, allowing the honest mining power of the entire network to participate in the secure ledger formation of each shard, thereby achieving the same level of security as an unsharded blockchain. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous atomic commitment mechanism to ensure transaction atomicity across shards with various mining rates. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Manifoldchain scales linearly in throughput with the increase in shard numbers and inversely with network delay in each shard. We implement a full system prototype of Manifoldchain, comprehensively evaluated on both simulated and real-world testbeds. These experiments validate its vertical scalability with network bandwidth and horizontal scalability with network size, achieving a substantial improvement of 186% in throughput over baseline sharding protocols, for scenarios where bandwidths of miners range from 5Mbps to 60Mbps. |

Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services. |

As many smart contracts process financial transactions, their security is paramount. Moreover, the immutability of blockchains makes vulnerabilities in smart contracts particularly challenging because it requires deploying a new version of the contract at a different address, incurring substantial fees paid in Ether. This paper proposes Ethstractor, the first smart contract collection tool for gathering a dataset of versioned smart contracts. The collected dataset is then used to evaluate the reliability of code metrics as indicators of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our findings indicate that code metrics are ineffective in signalling the presence of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we investigate whether vulnerabilities in newer versions of smart contracts are mitigated and identify that the number of vulnerabilities remains consistent over time. Finally, we examine the removal of self-admitted technical debt in contracts and uncover that most of the introduced debt has never been subsequently removed. |

This paper investigates the implementation of blockchain technology, specifically Hyperledger Fabric, for Electronic Health Records (EHR) management at Frere Hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The paper examines the benefits and challenges of integrating blockchain into healthcare information systems. Hyperledger Fabric's modular architecture is harnessed to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for storing, managing, and sharing EHRs among stakeholders. The study used a mixed-methods approach, integrating case studies and data collection methods through observation and informal questions, with the specific goal of understanding current record management methods and challenges. This method offers practical insights and validates the approach. The result demonstrates the role of blockchain in transforming healthcare, framed within a rigorous exploration and analysis. The findings of this study have broader implications for healthcare institutions seeking advanced solutions to address the persistent challenges in electronic health record management. Ultimately, the research underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology in healthcare settings, fostering trust, security, and efficiency in the management of sensitive patient data. |

We first suggest that they can be novel when integrated; we then conduct a literature review and case study following consensus-building for decentralization and token value for autonomy. Integration requires simultaneous consideration of strategic behavior, spamming, Sybil attacks, free-riding, marginal cost, marginal utility and stabilizers. This survey is the first systematization of knowledge on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics, aiming to bridge the contexts of economics and blockchain. |

In it, users can publish wearables used to customize avatars, which can be then sold or given away via blockchain transfers. Decentral Games (DG), a single project owning prominent in-world casinos, has by far created the most wearables, necessary to earn cryptocurrency in its flagship game ICE Poker. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on how DG and ICE Poker influence the dynamics of wearables and in-world visits in Decentraland. To this end, we analyzed 5.9 million wearable transfers made on the Polygon blockchain (and related sales) over a two-year period, and 677 million log events of in-world user positions in an overlapping 10-month period. We found that the platform-wise number of transfers and sales monetary value of wearables were disproportionally related to DG, and that its two ICE Poker casinos (less than 0.1% of the world map) represented a very large average share of daily unique visitors (33%) and time spent in the virtual world (20%). Despite several alternative in-world economic and artistic initiatives in Decentraland, some of which have attracted much attention from the general public, a single third-party online poker game appears to be the main driver of the analyzed dynamics. Our work thus contributes to the current understanding of user behavior in social virtual worlds, and it is among the first to study the emerging phenomenon of blockchain-based online gambling in virtual reality spaces. |

In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA. |

Focusing on Polymarket and starting from the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we synthesize behaviors over 15,000 addresses across 4,500 events and 8,500 markets, capturing the intensity and direction of their political leanings by the PBLS. We validate the PBLS through internal consistency checks and external comparisons. We uncover relationships between our PBLS and betting behaviors through over 800 features capturing various behavioral aspects. A case study of the 2022 U.S. Senate election further demonstrates the ability of our measurement while decoding the dynamic interaction between political and profitable motives. Our findings contribute to understanding decision-making in decentralized markets, enhancing the analysis of behaviors within Web3 prediction environments. The insights of this study reveal the potential of blockchain in enabling innovative, multidisciplinary studies and could inform the development of more effective online prediction markets, improve the accuracy of forecast, and help the design and optimization of platform mechanisms.

Drawing on a narrative analysis of three case studies, I find three possible drivers: (1) exit to DAO is motivated by both financial and stewardship goals which it simultaneously promises to realize via the issuance of tokens; (2) exit to DAO adds an additional layer of ownership and governance rights via tokens, without requiring existing rights to be relinquished, thus making it a lucrative strategy; and (3) markets, laws and social norms underpinning the broader environment in which exits to DAO occur, seem to play an important role in driving the decision. This paper contributes to the academic literature by situating DAOs as a hybrid (and perhaps incomplete) entrepreneurial exit strategy and identifying plausible drivers of the phenomenon which warrant further dedicated research. |
|**2024-07-19**|**Theoretical Analysis on Block Time Distributions in Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Blockchains**|Akihiro Fujihara et.al.|[2407.14299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14299)| Some blockchain networks employ a distributed consensus algorithm featuring Byzantine fault tolerance. Notably, certain public chains, such as Cosmos and Tezos, which operate on a proof-of-stake mechanism, have adopted this algorithm. While it is commonly assumed that these blockchains maintain a nearly constant block creation time, empirical analysis reveals fluctuations in this interval; this phenomenon has received limited attention. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to account for the processes of block propagation and validation within Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus blockchains, aiming to theoretically analyze the probability distribution of block time. First, we propose stochastic processes governing the broadcasting communications among validator nodes. Consequently, we theoretically demonstrate that the probability distribution of broadcast time among validator nodes adheres to the Gumbel distribution. This finding indicates that the distribution of block time typically arises from convolving multiple Gumbel distributions. Additionally, we derive an approximate formula for the block time distribution suitable for data analysis purposes. By fitting this approximation to real-world block time data, we demonstrate the consistent estimation of block time distribution parameters. |

However, protecting the security of semantic communication systems within the distributed and heterogeneous IoT networks is critical issues that need to be addressed. We develop a secure and efficient distributed semantic communication system in IoT scenarios, focusing on three aspects: secure system maintenance, efficient system update, and privacy-preserving system usage. Firstly, we propose a blockchain-based interaction framework that ensures the integrity, authentication, and availability of interactions among IoT devices to securely maintain system. This framework includes a novel digital signature verification mechanism designed for semantic communications, enabling secure and efficient interactions with semantic communications. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of interactions, we develop a flexible semantic communication scheme that leverages compressed semantic knowledge bases. This scheme reduces the data exchange required for system update and is adapt to dynamic task requirements and the diversity of device capabilities. Thirdly, we exploit the integration of differential privacy into semantic communications. We analyze the implementation of differential privacy taking into account the lossy nature of semantic communications and wireless channel distortions. An joint model-channel noise mechanism is introduced to achieve differential privacy preservation in semantic communications without compromising the system's functionality. Experiments show that the system is able to achieve integrity, availability, efficiency and the preservation of privacy. |

Establishing a trustworthy V2G operation environment is crucial for enabling large-scale EV user participation and realizing V2G potential in real-world applications. In this paper, an integrated scheduling and trading framework is developed to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, a cyber-physical blockchain architecture is proposed to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness. A case study, utilizing real-world data from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), demonstrates significant reductions in EV charging costs and the framework potential to support auxiliary grid services. |

It confirms vaccination against certain infectious diseases like COVID-19, Ebola, and flu. The key challenges faced by the digital vaccine passport system include passport forgery, unauthorized data access, and inaccurate information input by vaccination centers. Privacy concerns also need to be addressed to ensure that the user's personal identification information (PII) is not compromised. Additionally, it is necessary to track vaccine vials or doses to verify their authenticity, prevent misuse and illegal sales, as well as to restrict the illicit distribution of vaccines. To address these challenges, we propose a Blockchain-Enabled Secure Vaccine Passport System, leveraging the power of smart contracts. Our solution integrates off-chain and on-chain cryptographic computations, facilitating secure communication among various entities. We have utilized the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store encrypted vaccine passports of citizens securely. Our prototype is built on the Ethereum platform, with smart contracts deployed on the Sepolia Test network, allowing for performance evaluation and validation of the system's effectiveness. By combining IPFS as a distributed data storage platform and Ethereum as a blockchain platform, our solution paves the way for secure, efficient, and globally interoperable vaccine passport management, supporting comprehensive vaccination initiatives worldwide. |

Decentralised governance paradigms that integrate computation in physical domains (such as 'Decentralised Autonomous Organisations' (DAOs)) represent a novel approach to autono-mous governance and operations. These have been described as akin to cybernetic systems. Through the lens of a case study of an autonomous cabin called "no1s1" which demonstrates self-ownership via blockchain-based control and feedback loops, this research explores the potential for blockchain infrastructure to be utilised in the management of physical systems. By highlighting the considerations and challenges of decentralised governance in managing autonomous physical spaces, the study reveals that autonomy in the governance of autonomous CPS is not merely a technological feat but also involves a complex mesh of functional and social dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of developing continuous feedback loops and adaptive governance frameworks within decentralised CPS to address both expected and emergent challenges. This investigation contributes to the fields of infra-structure studies and Cyber-Physical Systems engineering. It also contributes to the discourse on decentralised governance and autonomous management of physical spaces by offering both practical insights and providing a framework for future research. |

Proof-of-Work (PoW), one of the most influential implementations of consensus mechanisms, consumes an extraordinary amount of energy for a task that lacks direct productive output. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a multi-winner federated learning validated consensus mechanism that redirects the computation power of blockchains to train federated learning models. In addition, we present a novel evaluation mechanism to ensure the efficiency of the locally trained models of miners. We evaluated the security of our evaluation mechanism by introducing and conducting probable attacks. Moreover, we present a novel reward distribution mechanism to incentivize winning miners fairly, and demonstrate that our reward system is fair both within and across all rounds. |

This study introduces Automated Gateways as a novel framework leveraging smart contracts to facilitate interoperability. Unlike existing solutions, which often require adopting new technologies or relying on external services, Automated Gateways framework is integrated directly with a blockchain's core infrastructure to enhance systems with built-in interoperability features. By implementing fine-grained access control mechanisms, smart contracts within this framework manage accessibility and authorization for cross-chain interactions and facilitate streamlining the selective sharing of services between blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates the framework's capability to handle cross-chain interactions efficiently, significantly reduce operational complexities, and uphold transactional integrity and security across different blockchain networks. With its focus on user-friendliness, self-managed permissions, and independence from external platforms, this framework is designed to achieve broader adoption within the blockchain community. |

The proposed system integrates inward focused sensors to monitor the car's internal state, such as the condition of its metal bodywork, wheels, engine, and battery, establishing a baseline homeostatic state representing optimal functionality. Outward facing sensors, like cameras and LIDAR, are then interpreted via their impact on the car's homeostatic state by quantifying deviations from homeostasis. This contrasts with the approach of trying to make cars "see" reality in a similar way to humans and identify elements in their reality in the same way humans. Virtual environments would be leveraged to accelerate training. Additionally, cars are programmed to communicate and share experiences via blockchain technology, learning from each other's mistakes while maintaining individualized training models. A dedicated language for self-driving cars is proposed to enable nuanced interpretation and response to environmental data. This architecture allows self-driving cars to dynamically adjust their behavior based on internal and external feedback, promoting cooperation and continuous improvement. The study concludes by discussing the broader implications for AI development, potential real-world applications, and future research directions. |
|**2024-07-16**|**L2AI: lightweight three-factor authentication and authorization in IOMT blockchain-based environment**|Laleh Khajehzadeh et.al.|[2407.12187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12187)| Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the digital revolution and is utilized in healthcare. In this context, IoT enables individuals to remotely manage their essential activities with minimal interaction. However, the limitations of network resources and the challenges of establishing a secure channel, as well as sharing and collecting sensitive information through an insecure public channel, pose security challenges for the medical IoT. This paper presents a lightweight multi-factor authentication and anonymous user authentication scheme to access real-time data in a blockchain-based environment. The scheme utilizes an insecure channel called L2AI. L2AI ensures security and efficiency while enhancing user anonymity through the use of pseudo-identity and dynamic indexing. The proposed method supports highly scalable systems with an efficient user registration process, allowing authenticated users to access both existing and newly added system entities without additional processes. Although the scheme is primarily designed for large systems, such as health infrastructure, it is also suitable for resource-constrained devices. The scheme relies on one-way cryptographic hashing functions and bitwise XOR operations. Additionally, a fuzzy mining algorithm is employed on the user side to verify the user's biometric information. L2AI adopts the "Real-Or-Random (ROR)" model for security proof and employs BAN logic for proof of authenticity. Formal security verification is conducted using the "Automatic Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Programs" (Proverif) tool, complemented by informal security analysis demonstrating the proper functionality of L2AI. |
|**2024-07-16**|**The Latency Price of Threshold Cryptosystem in Blockchains**|Zhuolun Xiang et.al.|[2407.12172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12172)| Threshold cryptography is essential for many blockchain protocols. For example, many protocols rely on threshold common coin to implement asynchronous consensus, leader elections, and provide support for randomized applications. Similarly, threshold signature schemes are frequently used for protocol efficiency and state certification, and threshold decryption and threshold time-lock puzzles are often necessary for privacy.   In this paper, we study the interplay between threshold cryptography and a class of blockchains that use Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols with a focus on latency. More specifically, we focus on blockchain-native threshold cryptosystem, where the blockchain validators seek to run a threshold cryptographic protocol once for every block with the block contents as an input to the threshold cryptographic protocol. All existing approaches for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems introduce a latency overhead of at least one message delay for running the threshold cryptographic protocol. In this paper, we first propose a mechanism to eliminate this overhead for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems with tight thresholds, i.e., in threshold cryptographic protocols where the secrecy and reconstruction thresholds are the same. However, many real-world proof-of-stake-based blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems rely on ramp thresholds, where reconstruction thresholds are strictly greater than secrecy thresholds. For these blockchains, we formally demonstrate that the additional delay is unavoidable. We then introduce a mechanism to minimize this delay in the optimistic case. We implement our optimistic protocol for the proof-of-stake distributed randomness scheme on the Aptos blockchain. Our measurements from the Aptos mainnet show that the optimistic approach reduces latency overhead by 71%. |

While supporters affirm that distributed ledger technology has potential to revolutionize gaming economies and provide players with control over their virtual assets, there are practical challenges such as energy consumption and user adoption to be addressed, and detractors question whether blockchain integration is even necessary. This report characterises popular blockchain-based gaming projects like Enjin and Axie Infinity, then compares metrics such as transaction cost and player feedback to evaluate the longevity of blockchain-integrated gaming as a whole. |

Other works have previously analyzed Artificial Intelligence code generation abilities. This paper aims to expand this to a larger scope to include programs where security and efficiency are of utmost priority such as smart contracts. The hypothesis leading into the study was that LLMs in general would have difficulty in rigorously implementing security details in the code, which was shown through our results, but surprisingly generally succeeded in many common types of contracts. We also discovered a novel way of generating smart contracts through new prompting strategies. |

While public blockchains enhance transparency and reliability, they conflict with confidentiality. To address this, we introduce Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications (MARTSIA). MARTSIA provides read-access control at the message-part level through user-defined policies and certifier-declared attributes, so that only authorized actors can interpret encrypted data while all blockchain nodes can verify its integrity. To this end, MARTSIA resorts to blockchain, Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption and distributed hash-table data-stores. |

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients. |

We examine the existing mechanisms for smart contract termination across several major blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, IOTA, Apotos, and Sui. We assess the compatibility of these mechanisms with the requirements of the EU Data Act, focusing on aspects such as consumer protection, error correction, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis reveals a diverse landscape of approaches, from immutable smart contracts with built-in termination conditions to upgradable smart contracts that allow for post-deployment modifications. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing the so-called smart contract "kill switches," such as the balance between enabling regulatory compliance and preserving the decentralized ethos, the technical feasibility of such mechanisms, and the implications for security and trust in the ecosystem. |
|**2024-07-14**|**Identity Chain**|Mahdi Darabi et.al.|[2407.10187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10187)| The first generation of cryptocurrencies introduced revolutionary concepts, yet faced challenges in privacy and regulatory compliance. While subsequent cryptocurrencies aimed to address privacy concerns (like Zcash and Monero), they often conflicted with regulatory frameworks, hindering broader adoption. In response, inspired by recent researches about privacy and accountability and incentive techniques in Blockchain, we propose IdentityChain as a novel framework that integrates privacy and accountability principles, leading to a robust system equipped with adaptable rules.   IdentityChain is a KYC (Know Your Customer) service on top of a public Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Ton, Polygon). The goal is to maintain privacy while ensuring compliance with existing regulations. Privacy is one of the key characteristics of IdentityChain, it's crucial for preventing conflicts of interests further discussed how. Accountability is also one of the main characteristics of IdentityChain and prevents from misbehave of users. Privacy and accountability together wouldn't be possible unless advancements in cryptography. |

|**2024-10-27**|**Thunderbolt: Causal Concurrent Consensus and Execution**|Junchao Chen et.al.|[2407.09409](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09409)| In the realm of blockchain, smart contracts have achieved widespread adoption due to their inherent programmability. However, smart contracts suffer from long execution delays, resulting from the analysis of the contract code. Consequently, the development of a system capable of facilitating high throughput and scalability holds paramount importance. Sharding represents a prevalent technique that enhances performance by horizontally scaling storage into individual shards. However, existing sharding methods rely on 2PC to handle cross-shard transactions through data locking, necessitating the provision of read/write sets in advance, which poses impractical challenges for smart contracts. This paper introduces Thunderbolt, a novel sharding architecture that integrates the Execute-Order-Validate(EOV) and Order-Execute(OE) models to manage single-shard transactions (Single-shard TXs) and cross-shard transactions (Cross-shard TXs) without coordinating the transactions by 2PC. Shards in Thunderbolt share all the replicas, and Thunderbolt assigns each replica as the shard submitter to propose the transactions. Each shard submitter employs the EOV model to execute Single-shard TXs concurrently while applying the OE model for executing Cross-shard TXs. We leverage the DAG-based protocol as the consensus protocol and modify the consensus logic to ensure correctness between Single-shard TXs and Cross-shard TXs. We implemented a concurrent executor to execute the Single-shard TXs locally to dynamically assign the scheduling order without any read/write set knowledge. Additionally, we introduce a novel shard reconfiguration to withstand censorship attacks by relocating the shards from the current DAG to a new DAG and rotating the shard submitters. Our comparison of the results on SmallBank with serial execution on Narwhal-Tusk revealed a remarkable 50x speedup with 64 replicas. |

Hugo et.al.|[2407.09353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09353)| The developed system aims to incorporate a private blockchain technology in the procurement process for the supply office. The procurement process includes the canvassing, purchasing, delivery and inspection of items, inventory, and disposal. The blockchain-based system includes a distributed ledger technology, peer-to-peer network, Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism, and SHA3-512 cryptographic hash function algorithm. This will ensure trust and proper accountability to the custodian of the property while safeguarding sensitive information in the procurement records. The extreme prototyping model will be used as software development life cycle. It is mostly used for web-based applications and has an increased user involvement. The prototype version of the system allows the users get a better understanding of the system being developed. It also reduces the time and cost, has quicker user feedback, missing and difficult functions can be recognized, and confusing processes can be addressed on an early stage. The implementation of a private blockchain technology has an increased privacy, enhanced security, improved efficiency, and reduced complexity over traditional blockchain network. The use of SHA3-512 as cryptographic hash function algorithm is much faster than its predecessors when cryptography is handled by hardware components. Furthermore, it is not vulnerable to length extension attacks making it reliable in terms of security of data. The study recommends the use of private blockchain-based technology with the procurement and asset management system in the supply office. The procurement records will be protected against tampering using this technology. This will promote trust and confidence of the stakeholders. The implementation of blockchain technology in developing a system served as advancement and innovation in terms of securing data. |
|**2024-07-11**|**Balancing Participation and Decentralization in Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrencies**|Aggelos Kiayias et.al.|[2407.08686](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08686)| Proof-of-stake blockchain protocols have emerged as a compelling paradigm for organizing distributed ledger systems. In proof-of-stake (PoS), a subset of stakeholders participate in validating a growing ledger of transactions. For the safety and liveness of the underlying system, it is desirable for the set of validators to include multiple independent entities as well as represent a non-negligible percentage of the total stake issued. In this paper, we study a secondary form of participation in the transaction validation process, which takes the form of stake delegation, whereby an agent delegates their stake to an active validator who acts as a stake pool operator. We study payment schemes that reward agents as a function of their collective actions regarding stake pool operation and delegation. Such payment schemes serve as a mechanism to incentivize participation in the validation process while maintaining decentralization. We observe natural trade-offs between these objectives and the total expenditure required to run the relevant payment schemes. Ultimately, we provide a family of payment schemes which can strike different balances between these competing objectives at equilibrium in a Bayesian game theoretic framework. |
|**2024-07-09**|**SpiralShard: Highly Concurrent and Secure Blockchain Sharding via Linked Cross-shard Endorsement**|You Lin et.al.|[2407.08651](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08651)| Blockchain sharding improves the scalability of blockchain systems by partitioning the whole blockchain state, nodes, and transaction workloads into different shards. However, existing blockchain sharding systems generally suffer from a small number of shards, resulting in limited concurrency. The main reason is that existing sharding systems require large shard sizes to ensure security. To enhance the concurrency of blockchain sharding securely, we propose SpiralShard. The intuition is to allow the existence of some shards with a larger fraction of malicious nodes (i.e., corrupted shards), thus reducing shard sizes. SpiralShard can configure more and smaller shards for higher concurrency at the same network size. To ensure security with the existence of corrupted shards, we propose the Linked Cross-shard Endorsement (LCE) protocol. According to our LCE protocol, the blocks of each shard are sequentially verified and endorsed by a group of shards before being finalized. As a result, a corrupted shard can eliminate forks with the help of the other shards. We implement SpiralShard based on Harmony and conduct extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that, compared with Harmony, SpiralShard achieves around 19x throughput gain under a large network size with 4,000+ nodes. |

Hashing is employed in blockchain networks to create linked block lists, which offer safe and secure distributed repository storage for critical information. Due to the unique nature of the hash search problem in blockchain networks, the most parallelization of calculations is possible. This technical report presents a performance evaluation of three popular hashing algorithms Blake3, SHA-256, and SHA-512. These hashing algorithms are widely used in various applications, such as digital signatures, message authentication, and password storage. It then discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the algorithms, such as hash rate/throughput and memory usage. The evaluation is conducted on a range of hardware platforms, including desktop and VMs. The evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks. The results of the evaluation show that Blake3 generally outperforms both SHA-256 and SHA-512 in terms of throughput and latency. However, the performance advantage of Blake3 varies depending on the specific hardware platform and the size of the input data.

We provide an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors, focusing on new attack surfaces introduced by advanced components in smart grids. The review particularly includes an extensive analysis of coordinated attacks that incorporate multiple attack strategies and exploit vulnerabilities across various smart grid components to increase their adverse impact, demonstrating the complexity and potential severity of these threats. Following this, we examine innovative detection and mitigation strategies, including game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, discussing their advancements in counteracting evolving threats and associated research challenges. In particular, our review covers a thorough examination of widely used machine learning-based mitigation strategies, analyzing their applications and research challenges spanning across supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning. Further, we outline future research directions and explore new techniques and concerns. We first discuss the research opportunities for existing and emerging strategies, and then explore the potential role of new techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning in the future of smart grid security. |
|**2024-07-08**|**Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts: A Comprehensive Survey**|Christopher De Baets et.al.|[2407.07922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07922)| In the growing field of blockchain technology, smart contracts exist as transformative digital agreements that execute transactions autonomously in decentralised networks. However, these contracts face challenges in the form of security vulnerabilities, posing significant financial and operational risks. While traditional methods to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts are limited due to a lack of comprehensiveness and effectiveness, integrating advanced machine learning technologies presents an attractive approach to increasing effective vulnerability countermeasures. We endeavour to fill an important gap in the existing literature by conducting a rigorous systematic review, exploring the intersection between machine learning and smart contracts. Specifically, the study examines the potential of machine learning techniques to improve the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We analysed 88 articles published between 2018 and 2023 from the following databases: IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The findings reveal that classical machine learning techniques, including KNN, RF, DT, XG-Boost, and SVM, outperform static tools in vulnerability detection. Moreover, multi-model approaches integrating deep learning and classical machine learning show significant improvements in precision and recall, while hybrid models employing various techniques achieve near-perfect performance in vulnerability detection accuracy.   By integrating state-of-the-art solutions, this work synthesises current methods, thoroughly investigates research gaps, and suggests directions for future studies. The insights gathered from this study are intended to serve as a seminal reference for academics, industry experts, and bodies interested in leveraging machine learning to enhance smart contract security. |

However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework's capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems. |

It operates by establishing channels between users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain until the channels are closed, with only the initial and final transactions recorded on the blockchain. Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is crucial for users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to collect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the network, forming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we analyze the graph structure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical relationships between node properties using machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We formulate a series of tasks to explore these relationships and provide benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how topological and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation of several models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks and highlights the insights gained from their application. |
|**2024-07-10**|**Searcher Competition in Block Building**|Akaki Mamageishvili et.al.|[2407.07474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07474)| We study the amount of maximal extractable value (MEV) captured by validators, as a function of searcher competition, in blockchains with competitive block building markets such as Ethereum. We argue that the core is a suitable solution concept in this context that makes robust predictions that are independent of implementation details or specific mechanisms chosen. We characterize how much value validators extract in the core and quantify the surplus share of validators as a function of searcher competition. Searchers can obtain at most the marginal value increase of the winning block relative to the best block that can be built without their bundles. Dually this gives a lower bound on the value extracted by the validator. If arbitrages are easy to find and many searchers find similar bundles, the validator gets paid all value almost surely, while searchers can capture most value if there is little searcher competition per arbitrage. For the case of passive block-proposers we study, moreover, mechanisms that implement core allocations in dominant strategies and find that for submodular value, there is a unique dominant-strategy incentive compatible core-selecting mechanism that gives each searcher exactly their marginal value contribution to the winning block. We validate our theoretical prediction empirically with aggregate bundle data and find a significant positive relation between the number of submitted backruns for the same opportunity and the median value captured by the proposer from the opportunity. |
|**2024-07-10**|**TDML -- A Trustworthy Distributed Machine Learning Framework**|Zhen Wang et.al.|[2407.07339](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07339)| Recent years have witnessed a surge in deep learning research, marked by the introduction of expansive generative models like OpenAI's SORA and GPT, Meta AI's LLAMA series, and Google's FLAN, BART, and Gemini models. However, the rapid advancement of large models (LM) has intensified the demand for computing resources, particularly GPUs, which are crucial for their parallel processing capabilities. This demand is exacerbated by limited GPU availability due to supply chain delays and monopolistic acquisition by major tech firms. Distributed Machine Learning (DML) methods, such as Federated Learning (FL), mitigate these challenges by partitioning data and models across multiple servers, though implementing optimizations like tensor and pipeline parallelism remains complex. Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and trust in distributed computing environments, but still lacks guidance on building practical DML systems. In this paper, we propose a \textit{trustworthy distributed machine learning} (TDML) framework that leverages blockchain to coordinate remote trainers and validate workloads, achieving privacy, transparency, and efficient model training across public remote computing resources. Experimental validation demonstrates TDML's efficacy in overcoming performance limitations and malicious node detection, positioning it as a robust solution for scalable and secure distributed machine learning. |

|**2024-07-09**|**Using Large Language Models for Generating Smart Contracts for Health Insurance from Textual Policies**|Inwon Kang et.al.|[2407.07019](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07019)| We explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate application code that automates health insurance processes from text-based policies. We target blockchain-based smart contracts as they offer immutability, verifiability, scalability, and a trustless setting: any number of parties can use the smart contracts, and they need not have previously established trust relationships with each other. Our methodology generates outputs at increasing levels of technical detail: (1) textual summaries, (2) declarative decision logic, and (3) smart contract code with unit tests. We ascertain LLMs are good at the task (1), and the structured output is useful to validate tasks (2) and (3). Declarative languages (task 2) are often used to formalize healthcare policies, but their execution on blockchain is non-trivial. Hence, task (3) attempts to directly automate the process using smart contracts. To assess the LLM output, we propose completeness, soundness, clarity, syntax, and functioning code as metrics. Our evaluation employs three health insurance policies (scenarios) with increasing difficulty from Medicare's official booklet. Our evaluation uses GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and CodeLLaMA. Our findings confirm that LLMs perform quite well in generating textual summaries. Although outputs from tasks (2)-(3) are useful starting points, they require human oversight: in multiple cases, even "runnable" code will not yield sound results; the popularity of the target language affects the output quality; and more complex scenarios still seem a bridge too far. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate the promise of LLMs for translating textual process descriptions into smart contracts. |

A well-performed blockchain sharding system requires both high performance and high security in both intra- and cross-shard perspectives. However, existing protocols either have issues on protecting security or trade off great performance for security. In this paper, we propose SP-Chain, a blockchain sharding system with enhanced Security and Performance for both intra- and cross-shard perspectives. For intra-shard aspect, we design a two-phase concurrent voting scheme to provide high system throughput and low transaction confirmation latency. Moreover, we propose an efficient unbiased leader rotation scheme to ensure high performance under malicious behavior. For cross-shard aspect, a proof-assisted efficient cross-shard transaction processing mechanism is proposed to guard the cross-shard transactions with low overhead. We implement SP-Chain based on Harmony, and evaluate its performance via large-scale deployment. Extensive evaluations suggest that SP-Chain can process more than 10,000 tx/sec under malicious behaviors with a confirmation latency of 7.6s in a network of 4,000 nodes. |
|**2024-07-09**|**DL-Chain: Scalable and Stable Blockchain Sharding with High Concurrency via Dual-Layer Consensus**|You Lin et.al.|[2407.06882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06882)| Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by partitioning nodes into multiple groups for concurrent transaction processing. Configuring a large number of \emph{small shards} helps improve the transaction concurrency of a sharding system. However, it increases the fraction of malicious nodes within each shard, easily leading to shard corruption and jeopardizing system security. Some existing works have attempted to improve concurrency by reducing the shard size while maintaining security. However, they often require frequent and time-consuming recovery of corrupted shards, leading to severe system stagnation. Also, they usually require network-wide consensus to guarantee security, which limits scalability.   To address these issues, we propose DL-Chain, a blockchain sharding system that can securely provide \emph{high concurrency with stable and scalable performance.} Our core idea is a \underline{D}ual-\underline{L}ayer architecture and consensus, which consists of numerous smaller proposer shards (PSs) for transaction processing and multiple larger finalizer committees (FCs) for transaction finalization. To avoid system stagnation and thus guarantee stable performance, we ensure PSs' liveness even if they are corrupted through the cooperation of PSs and FCs, thus eliminating the recovery process of corrupted PSs. To better trade-off security and scalability, we fine-tune the FCs to enable multiple FCs to coexist securely. As a result, DL-Chain allows a larger fraction of malicious nodes in each PS ( $<1/2$ ) and thus can securely configure smaller shards for boosted stable and scalable concurrency. Evaluation results show that DL-Chain achieves up to 10 times improvement in throughput compared to existing solutions and provides stable concurrency with up to 2,550 nodes. |

The system is based on the idea that the FL collaborators upload the (ciphered) model parameters on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and interact with a dedicated smart contract to track their behavior. Thank to this smart contract, the phases of parameter updates are managed efficiently, thereby strengthening data security. We have carried out an experimental study that exploits two different methods of weight aggregation, i.e., a classic averaging scheme and a federated proximal aggregation. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposal. |
|**2024-07-09**|**The Cost of Executing Business Processes on Next-Generation Blockchains: The Case of Algorand**|Fabian Stiehle et.al.|[2407.06725](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06725)| Process (or workflow) execution on blockchain suffers from limited scalability; specifically, costs in the form of transactions fees are a major limitation for employing traditional public blockchain platforms in practice. Research, so far, has mainly focused on exploring first (Bitcoin) and second-generation (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains for business process enactment. However, since then, novel blockchain systems have been introduced - aimed at tackling many of the problems of previous-generation blockchains. We study such a system, Algorand, from a process execution perspective. Algorand promises low transaction fees and fast finality. However, Algorand's cost structure differs greatly from previous generation blockchains, rendering earlier cost models for blockchain-based process execution non-applicable. We discuss and contrast Algorand's novel cost structure with Ethereum's well-known cost model. To study the impact for process execution, we present a compiler for BPMN Choreographies, with an intermediary layer, which can support multi-platform output, and provide a translation to TEAL contracts, the smart contract language of Algorand. We compare the cost of executing processes on Algorand to previous work as well as traditional cloud computing. In short: they allow vast cost benefits. However, we note a multitude of future research challenges that remain in investigating and comparing such results. |

It can be integrated with various software and simulation tools used in robotics (we have integrated it with ARGoS, Gazebo, and ROS2), and also be deployed on real robots capable of Wi-Fi communications. The Toychain package supports the deployment of smart contracts written in Python (computer programs that can be executed by and synchronized across a distributed network). The nodes in the blockchain can execute smart contract functions by broadcasting transactions, which update the state of the blockchain upon agreement by all other nodes. The conditions for this agreement are established by a consensus protocol. The Toychain package allows for custom implementations of the consensus protocol, which can be useful for research or meeting specific application requirements. Currently, Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Authority are implemented. |

|**2024-08-09**|**Towards Understanding the Bugs in Solidity Compiler**|Haoyang Ma et.al.|[2407.05981](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05981)| Solidity compiler plays a key role in enabling the development of smart contract applications on Ethereum by governing the syntax of a domain-specific language called Solidity and performing compilation and optimization of Solidity code. The correctness of Solidity compiler is critical in fostering transparency, efficiency, and trust in industries reliant on smart contracts. However, like other software systems, Solidity compiler is prone to bugs, which may produce incorrect bytecodes on blockchain platforms, resulting in severe security concerns. As a domain-specific compiler for smart contracts, Solidity compiler differs from other compilers in many perspectives, posing unique challenges to detect its bugs. To understand the bugs in Solidity compiler and benefit future research, in this paper, we present the first systematic study on 533 Solidity compiler bugs. We carefully examined their characteristics (including symptoms, root causes, and distribution), and their triggering test cases. Our study leads to seven bug-revealing takeaways for Solidity compiler. Moreover, to study the limitations of Solidity compiler fuzzers and bring our findings into practical scenarios, we evaluate three Solidity compiler fuzzers on our constructed benchmark. The results show that these fuzzers are inefficient in detecting Solidity compiler bugs. The inefficiency arises from their failure to consider the interesting bug-inducing features, bug-related compilation flags, and test oracles |
|**2024-07-12**|**Pruning Blockchain Protocols for Efficient Access Control in IoT Systems**|Yongtao Huang et.al.|[2407.05506](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05506)| We consider access control for IoT systems that involves shared accesses to the IoT devices as well as their data. Since IoT devices are dispersed all over the edge of the Internet, traditional centralized access control has problems. Blockchain based decentralized access control is thus the new solution trend. However, existing blockchain based access control methods do not focus on performance issues and may incur a high communication overhead.   In this paper, we develop a Pruning Blockchain based Access Control (PBAC) protocol to cutdown the unnecessary message rounds and achieve high efficiency in access validations and policy management. The protocol includes a shortcut and a Role and Device Hierarchy-Based Access Control (R&D-BAC) approaches for different environment settings. To realize the PBAC protocol, it is necessary to carefully engineer the system architecture, which is also discussed in the paper. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the PBAC protocol, specifically, the shortcut mechanism reduces access time by approximately 43%, and R&D-BAC outperforms traditional blockchain based RBAC by more than two folds. |

Graph neural networks have been shown to be effective in learning semantic representations of smart contract code and are commonly adopted by existing deep learning-based SCVD. However, the current methods still have limitations in their utilization of graph sampling or subgraph pooling based on predefined rules for extracting crucial components from structure graphs of smart contract code. These predefined rule-based strategies, typically designed using static rules or heuristics, demonstrate limited adaptability to dynamically adjust extraction strategies according to the structure and content of the graph in heterogeneous topologies of smart contract code. Consequently, these strategies may not possess universal applicability to all smart contracts, potentially leading to false positives or omissions. To address these problems, we propose AFPNet, a novel vulnerability detection model equipped with a feature perception module that has dynamic weights for comprehensive scanning of the entire smart contract code and automatic extraction of crucial code snippets (the $P$ snippets with the largest weights). Subsequently, the relationship perception attention module employs an attention mechanism to learn dependencies among these code snippets and detect smart contract vulnerabilities. The efforts made by AFPNet consistently enable the capture of crucial code snippets and enhance the performance of SCVD optimization. We conduct an evaluation of AFPNet in the several large-scale datasets with vulnerability labels. The experimental results show that our AFPNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 6.38\%-14.02\% in term of F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AFPNet in dynamically extracting valuable information and vulnerability detection. |
|**2024-07-10**|**BFLN: A Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data**|Yang Li et.al.|[2407.05276](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05276)| As the application of federated learning becomes increasingly widespread, the issue of imbalanced training data distribution has emerged as a significant challenge. Federated learning utilizes local data stored on different training clients for model training, rather than centralizing data on a server, thereby greatly enhancing the privacy and security of training data. However, the distribution of training data across different clients may be imbalanced, with different categories of data potentially residing on different clients. This presents a challenge to traditional federated learning, which assumes data distribution is independent and identically distributed (IID). This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data (BFLN), which combines federated learning with blockchain technology. By introducing a new aggregation method and incentive algorithm, BFLN enhances the model performance of federated learning on non-IID data. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that, compared to other state-of-the-art models, BFLN improves training accuracy and provides a sustainable incentive mechanism for personalized federated learning. |

The goal is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches in order to determine the feasibility of employing blockchain technology for a decentralized PKI. The study will also evaluate the impact of current legal frameworks, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS-2 Directive. The study will examine various implementations of blockchain PKIs based on factors such as security, performance, and platform. The results indicate that blockchain-based PKIs can overcome the limitations of conventional PKIs by decentralizing the trust anchor, providing greater security. Blockchain technology allows for the immutable and transparent management of certificates, making tampering significantly more challenging. Additionally, blockchain-based PKIs offer enhanced mechanisms for identifying and addressing certificate misconduct. |

Enhancing the understanding of cross domain identity matching capabilities is essential, not only for practical applications such as commercial strategies and cybersecurity measures, but also for theoretical insights into the privacy implications of data disclosure. In this study, we demonstrate that individual temporal data, in the form of inter-event times distribution, constitutes an individual temporal fingerprint, allowing for matching profiles across different domains back to their associated real-world entity. We evaluate our methodology on encrypted digital trading platforms within the Ethereum Blockchain and present impressing results in matching identities across these privacy-preserving domains, while outperforming previously suggested models. Our findings indicate that simply knowing when an individual is active, even if information about who they talk to and what they discuss is lacking, poses risks to users' privacy, highlighting the inherent challenges in preserving privacy in today's digital landscape. |
|**2024-07-05**|**Effective Targeted Testing of Smart Contracts**|Mahdi Fooladgar et.al.|[2407.04250](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04250)| Smart contracts are autonomous and immutable pieces of code that are deployed on blockchain networks and run by miners. They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe. |

In this paper, we first study cyberattacks (e.g., flooding of transactions, brute pass) in blockchain networks and then propose an efficient collaborative cyberattack detection model to protect blockchain networks. Specifically, we deploy a blockchain network in our laboratory to build a new dataset including both normal and attack traffic data. The main aim of this dataset is to generate actual attack data from different nodes in the blockchain network that can be used to train and test blockchain attack detection models. We then propose a real-time collaborative learning model that enables nodes in the network to share learning knowledge without disclosing their private data, thereby significantly enhancing system performance for the whole network. The extensive simulation and real-time experimental results show that our proposed detection model can detect attacks in the blockchain network with an accuracy of up to 97%. |
|**2024-07-04**|**GriDB: Scaling Blockchain Database via Sharding and Off-Chain Cross-Shard Mechanism**|Zicong Hong et.al.|[2407.03750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03750)| Blockchain databases have attracted widespread attention but suffer from poor scalability due to underlying non-scalable blockchains. While blockchain sharding is necessary for a scalable blockchain database, it poses a new challenge named on-chain cross-shard database services. Each cross-shard database service (e.g., cross-shard queries or inter-shard load balancing) involves massive cross-shard data exchanges, while the existing cross-shard mechanisms need to process each cross-shard data exchange via the consensus of all nodes in the related shards (i.e., on-chain) to resist a Byzantine environment of blockchain, which eliminates sharding benefits. To tackle the challenge, this paper presents GriDB, the first scalable blockchain database, by designing a novel off-chain cross-shard mechanism for efficient cross-shard database services. Borrowing the idea of off-chain payments, GriDB delegates massive cross-shard data exchange to a few nodes, each of which is randomly picked from a different shard. Considering the Byzantine environment, the untrusted delegates cooperate to generate succinct proof for cross-shard data exchanges, while the consensus is only responsible for the low-cost proof verification. However, different from payments, the database services' verification has more requirements (e.g., completeness, correctness, freshness, and availability); thus, we introduce several new authenticated data structures (ADS). Particularly, we utilize consensus to extend the threat model and reduce the complexity of traditional accumulator-based ADS for verifiable cross-shard queries with a rich set of relational operators. Moreover, we study the necessity of inter-shard load balancing for a scalable blockchain database and design an off-chain and live approach for both efficiency and availability during balancing. |

However, existing works primarily focus on mitigating defenses against already identified real-world attacks. This paper introduces secure blockchain-mempool designs capable of defending against any form of asymmetric eviction DoS attacks. We establish formal security definitions for mempools under the eviction-based attack vector. Our proposed secure transaction admission algorithm, named \textsc{saferAd-CP}, ensures eviction-security by providing a provable lower bound on the cost of executing eviction DoS attacks. Through evaluation with real transaction trace replays, \textsc{saferAd-CP} demonstrates negligible latency and significantly high lower bounds against any eviction attack, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in securing blockchain mempools. |
|**2024-07-03**|**Scalable Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Verifying Cryptographic Hashing in Blockchain Applications**|Oleksandr Kuznetsov et.al.|[2407.03511](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03511)| Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a promising solution to address the scalability challenges in modern blockchain systems. This study proposes a methodology for generating and verifying ZKPs to ensure the computational integrity of cryptographic hashing, specifically focusing on the SHA-256 algorithm. By leveraging the Plonky2 framework, which implements the PLONK protocol with FRI commitment scheme, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach for both random data and real data blocks from the NEAR blockchain. The experimental results show consistent performance across different data sizes and types, with the time required for proof generation and verification remaining within acceptable limits. The generated circuits and proofs maintain manageable sizes, even for real-world data blocks with a large number of transactions. The proposed methodology contributes to the development of secure and trustworthy blockchain systems, where the integrity of computations can be verified without revealing the underlying data. Further research is needed to assess the applicability of the approach to other cryptographic primitives and to evaluate its performance in more complex real-world scenarios. |

The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the ZeroX framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions. |

Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those required by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in policy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI while facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a blockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate consent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow patient preferences and legal requirements. |

It facilitates effective AI training within sovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms. |

|**2024-07-02**|**Reusable Formal Verification of DAG-based Consensus Protocols**|Nathalie Bertrand et.al.|[2407.02167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02167)| DAG-based consensus protocols are being adoption by blockchain companies to decrease energy footprints and improve security. A DAG-based consensus protocol collaboratively constructs a partial order of blocks of transactions and produces linearly ordered blocks. The ubiquity and strategic importance of blockchains call for formal proof of the correctness of key components, namely, consensus protocols. This paper presents a safety-proven formal specification of two DAG-based protocols. Our specification highlights several dissemination, DAG construction, and ordering variations that can be combined to express the two protocols. The formalization requires a refinement approach for modeling the consensus. In an abstract model, we first show the safety of DAG-based consensus on leader blocks and then further refine the specification to encompass all blocks for all processes. The TLA+ specification for a given protocol consists of 492-732 lines, and the proof system TLAPS verifies 2025-2294 obligations in 6-8 minutes. |
|**2024-07-01**|**Immutable in Principle, Upgradeable by Design: Exploratory Study of Smart Contract Upgradeability**|Ilham Qasse et.al.|[2407.01493](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01493)| Smart contracts, known for their immutable nature to ensure trust via automated enforcement, have evolved to require upgradeability due to unforeseen vulnerabilities and the need for feature enhancements post-deployment. This contradiction between immutability and the need for modifications has led to the development of upgradeable smart contracts. These contracts are immutable in principle yet upgradable by design, allowing updates without altering the underlying data or state, thus preserving the contract's intent while allowing improvements. This study aims to understand the application and implications of upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By introducing a dataset that catalogs the versions and evolutionary trajectories of smart contracts, the research explores key dimensions: the prevalence and adoption patterns of upgrade mechanisms, the likelihood and occurrences of contract upgrades, the nature of modifications post-upgrade, and their impact on user engagement and contract activity. Through empirical analysis, this study identifies upgradeable contracts and examines their upgrade history to uncover trends, preferences, and challenges associated with modifications. The evidence from analyzing over 44 million contracts shows that only 3% have upgradeable characteristics, with only 0.34% undergoing upgrades. This finding underscores a cautious approach by developers towards modifications, possibly due to the complexity of upgrade processes or a preference for maintaining stability. Furthermore, the study shows that upgrades are mainly aimed at feature enhancement and vulnerability mitigation, particularly when the contracts' source codes are accessible. However, the relationship between upgrades and user activity is complex, suggesting that additional factors significantly affect the use of smart contracts beyond their evolution. |
|**2024-07-03**|**Maximizing Blockchain Performance: Mitigating Conflicting Transactions through Parallelism and Dependency Management**|Faisal Haque Bappy et.al.|[2407.01426](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01426)| While blockchains initially gained popularity in the realm of cryptocurrencies, their widespread adoption is expanding beyond conventional applications, driven by the imperative need for enhanced data security. Despite providing a secure network, blockchains come with certain tradeoffs, including high latency, lower throughput, and an increased number of transaction failures. A pivotal issue contributing to these challenges is the improper management of "conflicting transactions", commonly referred to as "contention". When a number of pending transactions within a blockchain collide with each other, this results in a state of contention. This situation worsens network latency, leads to the wastage of system resources, and ultimately contributes to reduced throughput and higher transaction failures. In response to this issue, in this work, we present a novel blockchain scheme that integrates transaction parallelism and an intelligent dependency manager aiming to reduce the occurrence of conflicting transactions within blockchain networks. In terms of effectiveness and efficiency, experimental results show that our scheme not only mitigates the challenges posed by conflicting transactions, but also outperforms both existing parallel and non-parallel Hyperledger Fabric blockchain networks achieving higher transaction success rate, throughput, and latency. The integration of our scheme with Hyperledger Fabric appears to be a promising solution for improving the overall performance and stability of blockchain networks in real-world applications. |

At its core, it is about building software that is secure in composition with untrusted code, a challenge that extends far beyond blockchains. We introduce SCIF, a language for building smart contracts that are compositionally secure. SCIF is based on the fundamentally compositional principle of secure information flow, but extends this core mechanism to include protection against reentrancy attacks, confused deputy attacks, and improper error handling, even in the presence of malicious contracts that do not follow SCIF's rules. SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We describe the SCIF language, including its static checking rules and runtime. Finally, we implement several applications with intricate security reasoning, showing how SCIF supports building complex smart contracts securely and gives programmer accurate diagnostics about potential security bugs. |

Empirical data and related work implies that previous airdrops fall short of their stated aim of attracting long-term users, partially due to adversarial farmers who game airdrop mechanisms and receive an outsize share of rewards. In this work, we argue that given the futility of fighting farmers, the airdrop business model should be reconsidered: farmers should be harnessed to generate activity that attracts real users, i.e., strengthens network effects. To understand the impact of farmers on airdrops, we analyze their performance in a market inhabited by two competing platforms and two tiers of users: real users and farmers. We show that counterintuitively, farmers sometimes represent a necessary evil-it can be revenue-optimal for airdrop issuers to give some tokens to farmers, even in the hypothetical case where platforms could costlessly detect and banish all farmers. Although we focus on airdrops, our results generally apply to activity-based incentive schemes. |
|**2024-07-01**|**Decentralized PKI Framework for Data Integrity in Spatial Crowdsourcing Drone Services**|Junaid Akram et.al.|[2407.00876](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00876)| In the domain of spatial crowdsourcing drone services, which includes tasks like delivery, surveillance, and data collection, secure communication is paramount. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ensures this by providing a system for digital certificates that authenticate the identities of entities involved, securing data and command transmissions between drones and their operators. However, the centralized trust model of traditional PKI, dependent on Certificate Authorities (CAs), presents a vulnerability due to its single point of failure, risking security breaches. To counteract this, the paper presents D2XChain, a blockchain-based PKI framework designed for the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). By decentralizing the CA infrastructure, D2XChain eliminates this single point of failure, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of drone communications. Fully compatible with the X.509 standard, it integrates seamlessly with existing PKI systems, supporting all key operations such as certificate registration, validation, verification, and revocation in a distributed manner. This innovative approach not only strengthens the defense of drone services against various security threats but also showcases its practical application through deployment on a private Ethereum testbed, representing a significant advancement in addressing the unique security challenges of drone-based services and ensuring their trustworthy operation in critical tasks. |

This system creates a marketplace where bushfire management authorities obtain essential data from drone operators. Key features include local differential privacy to protect data providers and a blockchain-based solution ensuring fair data exchanges and accountability. The framework is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating its scalability and potential for various large-scale data collection scenarios. This approach addresses privacy concerns and compliance with regulations like Australia's Privacy Act 1988, offering a practical solution for enhancing bushfire detection and management through crowdsourced drone services. |
|**2024-06-30**|**BAZAM: A Blockchain-Assisted Zero-Trust Authentication in Multi-UAV Wireless Networks**|Mingyue Xie et.al.|[2407.00630](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00630)| Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to interception and attacks when operated remotely without a unified and efficient identity authentication. Meanwhile, the openness of wireless communication environments potentially leads to data leakage and system paralysis. However, conventional authentication schemes in the UAV network are system-centric, failing to adapt to the diversity of UAVs identities and access, resulting in changes in network environments and connection statuses. Additionally, UAVs are not subjected to periodic identity compliance checks once authenticated, leading to difficulties in controlling access anomalies. Therefore, in this work, we consider a zero-trust framework for UAV network authentication, aiming to achieve UAVs identity authentication through the principle of ``never trust and always verify''. We introduce a blockchain-assisted zero-trust authentication scheme, namely BAZAM, designed for multi-UAV wireless networks. In this scheme, UAVs follow a key generation approach using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and cryptographic technique helps verify registration and access requests of UAVs. The blockchain is applied to store UAVs authentication information in immutable storage. Through thorough security analysis and extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BAZAM. |

As drones increasingly play a pivotal role across diverse sectors, integrating crowdsourced drone services within the IoDT has emerged as a vital avenue for democratizing access to these services. A critical challenge, however, lies in ensuring the authenticity and reliability of drone service reviews. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, DDRM addresses this challenge by instituting a verifiable and transparent review mechanism. The framework innovates with a dual-token system, comprising the Service Review Authorization Token (SRAT) for facilitating review authorization and the Drone Reputation Enhancement Token (DRET) for rewarding and recognizing drones demonstrating consistent reliability. Comprehensive analysis within this paper showcases DDRM's resilience against various reputation frauds and underscores its operational effectiveness, particularly in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of drone services. |
|**2024-06-29**|**Blockchain based Decentralized Petition System**|Jagdeep Kaur et.al.|[2407.00534](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00534)| A decentralized online petition system enables individuals or groups to create, sign, and share petitions without a central authority. Using blockchain technology, these systems ensure the integrity and transparency of the petition process by recording every signature or action on the blockchain, making alterations or deletions impossible. This provides a permanent, tamper-proof record of the petition's progress. Such systems allow users to bypass traditional intermediaries like government or social media platforms, fostering more democratic and transparent decision-making.   This paper reviews research on petition systems, highlighting the shortcomings of existing systems such as lack of accountability, vulnerability to hacking, and security issues. The proposed blockchain-based implementation aims to overcome these challenges. Decentralized voting systems have garnered interest recently due to their potential to provide secure and transparent voting platforms without intermediaries, addressing issues like voter fraud, manipulation, and trust in the electoral process.   We propose a decentralized voting system web application using blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of the voting process. This system aims to provide a transparent, decentralized decision-making process that counts every vote while eliminating the need for centralized authorities. The paper presents an overview of the system architecture, design considerations, and implementation details, along with the potential benefits and limitations.   Finally, we discuss future research directions, examining the technical aspects of the application, including underlying algorithms and protocols. Our research aims to enhance the integrity and accessibility of democratic processes, improve security, and ensure fairness, transparency, and tamper-proofness. |
|**2024-06-29**|**Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection for Ethereum**|Jiacheng Yao et.al.|[2407.00336](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00336)| The wide application of Ethereum technology has brought technological innovation to traditional industries. As one of Ethereum's core applications, smart contracts utilize diverse contract codes to meet various functional needs and have gained widespread use. However, the non-tamperability of smart contracts, coupled with vulnerabilities caused by natural flaws or human errors, has brought unprecedented challenges to blockchain security. Therefore, in order to ensure the healthy development of blockchain technology and the stability of the blockchain community, it is particularly important to study the vulnerability detection techniques for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Framework named DVDet. The framework initially converts the source code and bytecode of smart contracts into weighted graphs and control flow sequences, capturing potential risk features from these two perspectives and integrating them for analysis, ultimately achieving effective contract vulnerability detection. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum dataset show that our method outperforms others in detecting vulnerabilities. |

We present novel techniques for the verification of threshold automata, based on well-structured transition systems, that allow us to extend the expressiveness of both the computational model and the specifications that can be verified. In particular, we extend the model to allow decrements and resets of shared variables, possibly on cycles, and the specifications to general coverability. While these extensions of the model in general lead to undecidability, our algorithms provide a semi-decision procedure. We demonstrate the benefit of our extensions by showing that we can model complex round-based algorithms such as the phase king consensus algorithm and the Red Belly Blockchain protocol (published in 2019), and verify them fully automatically for the first time. |
|**2024-06-28**|**Quantum-Enhanced Secure Approval Voting Protocol**|Saiyam Sakhuja et.al.|[2406.19730](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19730)| In a world where elections touch every aspect of society, the need for secure voting is paramount. Traditional safeguards, based on classical cryptography, rely on complex math problems like factoring large numbers. However, quantum computing is changing the game. Recent advances in quantum technology suggest that classical cryptographic methods may not be as secure as we thought. This paper introduces a quantum voting protocol, a blend of quantum principles (entanglement and superposition), blockchain technology, and digital signatures, all powered by $\log_2{n}$ qubits, and designed for approval voting with n candidates. The result is a symphony of security features - binding, anonymity, non-reusability, verifiability, eligibility, and fairness - that chart a new course for voting security. The real world beckons, as we tested this protocol on IBM quantum hardware, achieving impressively low error rates of just 1.17% in a four-candidate election. |
|**2024-07-03**|**Commodification of Compute**|Jesper Kristensen et.al.|[2406.19261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261)| The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute. |

The verification of relevant device credentials during device registration helps to overcome this problem. However, on-chain verification in decentralized applications (dApp) discloses potentially confidential device attributes whereas off-chain verification introduces undesirable trust assumptions. In this paper, we propose a credential-based device registration (CDR) mechanism that verifies device credentials on the blockchain and leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to protect confidential device attributes from being disclosed. We characterize CDR for DePINs, present a general system model, and technically evaluate CDR using zkSNARKs with Groth16 and Marlin. Our experiments give first insights into performance impacts and reveal a tradeoff between the applied proof systems. |

We propose a method for selective disclosure and privacy-preserving revocation of digital credentials using second-order Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. We make holders able to present proofs of possession of selected credentials without disclosing them, and we protect their presentations from replay attacks. Revocations may be distributed among multiple revocation issuers using publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) and activated only by configurable consensus, ensuring robust protection against issuer corruption. Our system's unique design enables extremely fast revocation checks, even with large revocation lists, leveraging optimized hash map lookups. |
|**2024-06-27**|**A Treatment of EIP-1559: Enhancing Transaction Fee Mechanism through Nth-Price Auction**|Kun Li et.al.|[2406.18957](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18957)| With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, the transaction fee mechanism (TFM) in blockchain systems has become a prominent research topic. An ideal TFM should satisfy user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and miner-user side contract proofness ( $c$-SCP). However, state-of-the-art works either fail to meet these three properties simultaneously or only satisfy them under certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a burning $N$-price auction TFM named BNP. This mechanism divides the transaction fee into a base fee, which is burned, and a priority fee, which is allocated to miners. Theoretical proofs and experimental analyses demonstrate that, even under conditions of significant transaction congestion, this mechanism satisfies UIC, MIC, and $c$ -SCP simultaneously. Furthermore, the BNP mechanism is not constrained by the type of blockchain consensus, making it widely applicable. |
|**2024-06-26**|**From Tweet to Theft: Tracing the Flow of Stolen Cryptocurrency**|Guglielmo Cola et.al.|[2406.18503](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18503)| This paper presents a case study of a cryptocurrency scam that utilized coordinated and inauthentic behavior on Twitter. In 2020, 143 accounts sold by an underground merchant were used to orchestrate a fake giveaway. Tweets pointing to a fake blog post lured victims into sending Uniswap tokens (UNI) to designated addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, with the false promise of receiving more tokens in return. Using one of the scammer's addresses and leveraging the transparency and immutability of the Ethereum blockchain, we traced the flow of stolen funds through various addresses, revealing the tactics adopted to obfuscate traceability. The final destination of the funds involved two deposit addresses. The first, managed by a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, was likely associated with the scammer's own account on that platform and saw deposits exceeding $3.5 million. The second address was linked to a popular cryptocurrency swap service. These findings highlight the critical need for more stringent measures to verify the source of funds and prevent illicit activities. |

Allen et.al.|[2406.18457](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18457)| Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are a new type of digital organisation that uses blockchain infrastructure (e.g. smart contracts, tokens) to coordinate a group of people around a shared mission. Like all organisations, DAOs must attract sources of funding and other resources, and discover and retain a talented community and workforce. To do this, they must signal their true quality. Yet the characteristics of the environment that DAOs operate in (pseudonymous actors, global scale, permissionless entry and exit) makes this difficult. We apply costly signalling theory to explore the information asymmetry problem in DAOs and some of the strategies (behaviours and investments) and institutional solutions (including better signalling mechanisms) that have evolved to solve this problem. |

By analyzing the annual reports of 4407 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from 2005 to 2022, a comprehensive set of DT indicators was constructed. The findings revealed that DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, however, different digital technologies exhibit varying effects on financial performance. Specifically, blockchain technology has a relatively limited positive impact on financial performance. In addition, this study further discovered that DT can promote the growth of financial performance by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. This study provides a novel DT evaluation tool for the academic community, while also expanding the application scope of generative artificial intelligence technology in economic research. |

Most LBSs require proof of location (PoL) to prove that the user satisfies the service requirement, which exposes the user's privacy. In this paper, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of location (zk-PoL) protocol to better protect the user's privacy. With the zk-PoL protocol, the user can choose necessary information to expose to the server, so that hierarchical privacy protection can be achieved. The evaluation shows that the zk-PoL has excellent security to resist main attacks, moreover the computational efficiency is independent of input parameters and the zk-PoL is appropriate to delay-tolerant LBSs. |

Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) provides a trust-building approach via repeated interactions rather than relying on pre-established trust or central authentication. Such a trust-building process naturally supports dynamic trusted services across various service providers (SP) without the need for perimeter-based authentications; however, it remains vulnerable to environmental and system unreliability such as wireless channel uncertainty. In this study, we investigate channel unreliability in the trust-building framework based on repeated interactions for secure wireless services. We derive specific requirements for achieving cooperation between SP and client via a repeated game model and illustrate the implications of channel unreliability on sustaining trusted access services. We consider the framework optimization to guarantee SP-client cooperation, given a worst-case channel condition. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of cooperation region to represent the robustness of the trust-building process and explore the maximum cooperation area to enhance service resilience. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate the system performance over fading channels and verify our results. |

The protocol outlines a method for distributing information about the status of satellite communication services across the entire blockchain network, facilitating fairness and transparency in all communication services. Our primary objective is to standardize the services delivered by all satellite networks under the communication satellite protocol. This standard remains intact regardless of potential unreliability associated with the satellites or the terminal hardware. We proposed PoD (Proof of Distribution) to verify if the communication satellites are online and PoF (Proof of Flow) to authenticate the actual data flow provided by the communication satellites. In addition, we also proposed PoM (Proof of Mesh) to verify if the communication satellites have successfully meshed together. Utilizing zero-knowledge proof and multi-party cryptographic computations, we can evaluate the service provisioning parameters of each satellite, even in the presence of potential terminal or network node fraud. This method offers technical support for the modeling of distributed network services. |

Although the 'stop using my data' right should be a fundamental data right, which allows individuals to request their personal data to be no longer utilized by online platforms, the existing preventive data protection measures (e.g., cryptographic data elimination, differential privacy) are unfortunately not applicable. This work aims to develop the first Evidence Generation Framework for deterring post-acquisition data right violations. We formulated the 'stop using my data' problem, which captures a vantage facet of the multi-faceted notion of 'right to be forgotten'. We designed and implemented the first blockchain-assisted system to generate evidence for deterring the violations of the 'stop using my data' right. Our system employs a novel two-stage evidence generation protocol whose efficacy is ensured by a newly proposed Lemma. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study on recommendation systems with systematic evaluation experiments using two real-world datasets: the measured success rate exceeds 99%. |

This framework is implemented at the testbed of the Future Factories Lab at the University of South Carolina. The proposed system aims to enhance understanding, analysis, and decision-making processes by immersing users in a VR environment where complex manufacturing data stored using blockchain is translated into intuitive and interactive representations. The project focuses on two main components: blockchain and VR. Hyperledger Fabric is employed to establish a blockchain network, recording data from the Future Factories testbed. This system captures information from various sources, such as potentiometers on robot grippers to measure grip positioning, load cells to gauge pressure, emergency stop buttons, temperature, speed, and vibration sensors on the conveyors. Whenever predefined conditions are met, pertinent data, including sensor ID, timestamp, value, cause, and importance, is securely recorded in the blockchain, signaling the occurrence of a defect within the cell. Data retrieved from the blockchain system is accessed through 'GET' API requests. A VR application is developed using a cross-platform Unity game engine to visualize the data retrieved from the blockchain database. Meta Quest 3 is used as the targeted Head Mounted VR device. The VR application has two C# scripts: one script to query blockchain data using 'GET' API calls and another script converts the JSON object to text data to visualize in the VR system. The proposed system leverages blockchain technology and VR visualization to deliver immersive, actionable insights using secure data transmission. By embracing the proposed framework, manufacturers can unlock new potential for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in today's increasingly complex and interconnected manufacturing workplace. |

Using blockchain-based federated learning principles, our proposed framework includes a robust aggregation mechanism designed to counteract malicious updates from compromised clients, enhancing the security of the global learning process. Moreover, secure and reliable trust computation is essential for remote work and collaboration. The robust ZTA framework integrates anomaly detection and trust computation, ensuring secure and reliable device collaboration in a decentralized fashion. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying user contexts, using unsupervised clustering to detect novel anomalies, like zero-day attacks. To ensure a reliable and scalable trust computation, we develop an algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying user contexts by employing incremental anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify and share local and global anomalies between nodes. Future directions include scalability improvements, Dirichlet process for advanced anomaly detection, privacy-preserving techniques, and the integration of post-quantum cryptographic methods to safeguard against emerging quantum threats. |
|**2024-08-02**|**Competitive Policies for Online Collateral Maintenance**|Ghada Almashaqbeh et.al.|[2406.17121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17121)| Layer-two blockchain protocols emerged to address scalability issues related to fees, storage cost, and confirmation delay of on-chain transactions. They aggregate off-chain transactions into a fewer on-chain ones, thus offering immediate settlement and reduced transaction fees. To preserve security of the underlying ledger, layer-two protocols often work in a collateralized model; resources are committed on-chain to backup off-chain activities. A fundamental challenge that arises in this setup is determining a policy for establishing, committing, and replenishing the collateral in a way that maximizes the value of settled transactions.   In this paper, we study this problem under two settings that model collateralized layer-two protocols. The first is a general model in which a party has an on-chain collateral C with a policy to decide on whether to settle or discard each incoming transaction. The policy also specifies when to replenish C based on the remaining collateral value. The second model considers a discrete setup in which C is divided among k wallets, each of which is of size C/k, such that when a wallet is full, and so cannot settle any incoming transactions, it will be replenished. We devise several online policies for these models, and show how competitive they are compared to optimal (offline) policies that have full knowledge of the incoming transaction stream. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and formulate online competitive policies for collateral and wallet management in the blockchain setting. |

They are considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, a large category under Web 3.0. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues in terms of throughput and on-chain state size. Existing scalability solutions, when employed in the context of AMMs, are either ineffective due to their large overhead, or suffer from security and centralization issues.   In this paper, we address these challenges by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing while preserving the correct and secure operation of AMMs. These include a functionality-split and layer 2 traffic summarization paradigm, an epoch-based deposit mechanism, and pool snapshot-based and delayed token-payout trading. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 96.05% and the chain growth by at least 93.42%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice. |
|**2024-06-24**|**A Multi-Party, Multi-Blockchain Atomic Swap Protocol with Universal Adaptor Secret**|Shengewei You et.al.|[2406.16822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16822)| The increasing complexity of digital asset transactions across multiple blockchains necessitates a robust atomic swap protocol that can securely handle more than two participants. Traditional atomic swap protocols, including those based on adaptor signatures, are vulnerable to malicious dropout attacks, which break atomicity and compromise the security of the transaction. This paper presents a novel multi-party atomic swap protocol that operates almost entirely off-chain, requiring only a single on-chain transaction for finalization. Our protocol leverages Schnorr-like signature verification and a universal adaptor secret to ensure atomicity and scalability across any number of participants and blockchains without the need for smart contracts or trusted third parties. By addressing key challenges such as collusion attacks and malicious dropouts, our protocol significantly enhances the security and efficiency of multi-party atomic swaps. Our contributions include the first scalable, fully off-chain protocol for atomic swaps involving any number of participants, adding zero overhead to native blockchains, and providing a practical and cost-effective solution for decentralized asset exchanges. |

Over the last two decades, there has been substantial algorithmic research on distributed protocols for building P2P networks with various desirable properties such as high expansion, low diameter, and robustness to a large number of deletions. A key underlying theme in all of these works is to distributively build a \emph{random graph} topology that guarantees the above properties. Moreover, the random connectivity topology is widely deployed in many P2P systems today, including those that implement blockchains and cryptocurrencies. However, a major drawback of using a random graph topology for a P2P network is that the random topology does not respect the \emph{underlying} (Internet) communication topology. This creates a large \emph{propagation delay}, which is a major communication bottleneck in modern P2P networks.   In this paper, we work towards designing P2P networks that are communication-efficient (having small propagation delay) with provable guarantees. Our main contribution is an efficient, decentralized protocol, $\textsc{Close-Weaver}$ , that transforms a random graph topology embedded in an underlying Euclidean space into a topology that also respects the underlying metric. We then present efficient point-to-point routing and broadcast protocols that achieve essentially optimal performance with respect to the underlying space. |

Executing smart contracts requires gas costs paid by users, which define the limits of the contract's execution. Logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to financial losses, and are often the root cause of high-impact cyberattacks. Our objective is threefold: (i) empirically investigate logic vulnerabilities in real-world smart contracts extracted from code changes on GitHub, (ii) introduce Soley, an automated method for detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) examine mitigation strategies employed by smart contract developers to address these vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios. We obtained smart contracts and related code changes from GitHub. To address the first and third objectives, we qualitatively investigated available logic vulnerabilities using an open coding method. We identified these vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies. For the second objective, we extracted various logic vulnerabilities, applied preprocessing techniques, and implemented and trained the proposed Soley model. We evaluated Soley along with the performance of various LLMs and compared the results with the state-of-the-art baseline on the task of logic vulnerability detection. From our analysis, we identified nine novel logic vulnerabilities, extending existing taxonomies with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we introduced several mitigation strategies extracted from observed developer modifications in real-world scenarios. Our Soley method outperforms existing methods in automatically identifying logic vulnerabilities. Interestingly, the efficacy of LLMs in this task was evident without requiring extensive feature engineering. |

One significant service of IoT technologies that is essential for these applications is localization. The goal of this service is to determine the precise position of a specific target. The localization data often needs to be private, accessible only to specific entities, and must maintain authenticity and integrity to ensure trustworthiness. IoT technology has evolved significantly, with Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology enhancing localization speed and precision. However, IoT device security remains a concern, as devices can be compromised or act maliciously. Furthermore, localization data is typically stored centrally, which can also be a point of vulnerability. Our approach leverages the features of a permissioned blockchain, specifically Hyperledger Fabric, to address these challenges. Hyperledger Fabric's collection feature ensures data privacy, and its smart contracts (chaincode) enhance trustworthiness. We tested our solution using a network of devices known as CLOVES, demonstrating robust performance characteristics with UWB technology. Additionally, we evaluated our approach through an indoor localization use case. |

Cross-chain bridge is a specific type of decentralized application for asset exchange across different blockchain platforms. Securing the smart contracts of cross-chain bridges is in urgent need, as there are a number of recent security incidents with heavy financial losses caused by vulnerabilities in bridge smart contracts, as we call them Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities (CCVs). However, automatically identifying CCVs in smart contracts poses several unique challenges. Particularly, it is non-trivial to (1) identify application-specific access control constraints needed for cross-bridge asset exchange, and (2) identify inconsistent cross-chain semantics between the two sides of the bridge.   In this paper, we propose SmartAxe, a new framework to identify vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridge smart contracts. Particularly, to locate vulnerable functions that have access control incompleteness, SmartAxe models the heterogeneous implementations of access control and finds necessary security checks in smart contracts through probabilistic pattern inference. Besides, SmartAxe constructs cross-chain control-flow graph (xCFG) and data-flow graph (xDFG), which help to find semantic inconsistency during cross-chain data communication. To evaluate SmartAxe, we collect and label a dataset of 88 CCVs from real-attacks cross-chain bridge contracts. Evaluation results show that SmartAxe achieves a precision of 84.95% and a recall of 89.77%. In addition, SmartAxe successfully identifies 232 new/unknown CCVs from 129 real-world cross-chain bridge applications (i.e., from 1,703 smart contracts). These identified CCVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 1,885,250 USD. |

One of the unique designs in Solidity smart contracts is its state-reverting mechanism for error handling and access control. Unfortunately, a number of recent security incidents showed that adversaries also utilize this mechanism to manipulate critical states of smart contracts, and hence, bring security consequences such as illegal profit-gain and Deny-of-Service (DoS). In this paper, we call such vulnerabilities as the State-reverting Vulnerability (SRV). Automatically identifying SRVs poses unique challenges, as it requires an in-depth analysis and understanding of the state-dependency relations in smart contracts.   This paper presents SmartState, a new framework for detecting state-reverting vulnerability in Solidity smart contracts via fine-grained state-dependency analysis. SmartState integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness. Particularly, Smart-State extracts state dependencies from both contract bytecode and historical transactions. Both of them are critical for inferring dependencies related to SRVs. Further, SmartState models the generic patterns of SRVs (i.e., profit-gain and DoS) as SRV indicators, and hence effectively identify SRVs based on the constructed state-dependency graph. To evaluate SmartState, we manually annotated a ground-truth dataset which contains 91 SRVs in the real world. Evaluation results showed that SmartState achieves a precision of 87.23% and a recall of 89.13%. In addition, SmartState successfully identifies 406 new SRVs from 47,351 real-world smart contracts. 11 of these SRVs are from popular smart contracts with high transaction amounts (i.e., top 2000). In total, our reported SRVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 428,600 USD. |
|**2024-06-17**|**Blockchain for Academic Integrity: Developing the Blockchain Academic Credential Interoperability Protocol (BACIP)**|Juan A. Berrios Moya et.al.|[2406.15482](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15482)| This research introduces the Blockchain Academic Credential Interoperability Protocol (BACIP), designed to significantly enhance the security, privacy, and interoperability of verifying academic credentials globally, addressing the widespread issue of academic fraud. BACIP integrates dual blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and zero-knowledge proofs to offer a scalable and transparent framework aimed at reducing fraud and improving the mobility and opportunities for students and professionals worldwide. The research methodology adopts a mixed-methods approach, involving a rigorous review of pertinent literature and systematic integration of advanced technological components. This includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses that underpin the development of a universally compatible system. Preliminary evaluations suggest that BACIP could enhance verification efficiency and bolster security against tampering and unauthorized access. While the theoretical framework and practical implementations have laid a solid foundation, the protocol's real-world efficacy awaits empirical validation in a production environment. Future research will focus on deploying a prototype, establishing robust validation policies, and defining precise testing parameters. This critical phase is indispensable for a thorough assessment of BACIP's operational robustness and its compliance with international educational standards. This work contributes significantly to the academic field by proposing a robust model for managing and safeguarding academic credentials, thus laying a strong foundation for further innovation in credential verification using blockchain technology. |

Although AIGC is playing an increasingly significant role in business and culture, questions surrounding its copyright have sparked widespread debate. The current legal framework for copyright and intellectual property is grounded in the concept of human authorship, but in the creation of AIGC, human creators primarily provide conceptual ideas, with AI independently responsible for the expressive elements. This disconnect creates complexity and difficulty in determining copyright ownership under existing laws. Consequently, it is imperative to reassess the intellectual contributions of all parties involved in the creation of AIGC to ensure a fair allocation of copyright ownership. To address this challenge, we introduce AIGC-Chain, a blockchain-enabled full lifecycle recording system designed to manage the copyright of AIGC products. It is engineered to meticulously document the entire lifecycle of AIGC products, providing a transparent and dependable platform for copyright management. Furthermore, we propose a copyright tracing method based on an Indistinguishable Bloom Filter, named IBFT, which enhances the efficiency of blockchain transaction queries and significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent copyright claims for AIGC products. In this way, auditors can analyze the copyright of AIGC products by reviewing all relevant information retrieved from the blockchain. |

Arikkat et.al.|[2406.14102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14102)| The rise of IT-dependent operations in modern organizations has heightened their vulnerability to cyberattacks. As a growing number of organizations include smart, interconnected devices in their systems to automate their processes, the attack surface becomes much bigger, and the complexity and frequency of attacks pose a significant threat. Consequently, organizations have been compelled to seek innovative approaches to mitigate the menaces inherent in their infrastructure. In response, considerable research efforts have been directed towards creating effective solutions for sharing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Current information-sharing methods lack privacy safeguards, leaving organizations vulnerable to leaks of both proprietary and confidential data. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel framework called SeCTIS (Secure Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing), integrating Swarm Learning and Blockchain technologies to enable businesses to collaborate, preserving the privacy of their CTI data. Moreover, our approach provides a way to assess the data and model quality, and the trustworthiness of all the participants leveraging some validators through Zero Knowledge Proofs. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates our framework's correctness and performance, and the detailed attack model discusses its robustness against attacks in the context of data and model quality. |

While Bitcoin has become incredibly famous, its transaction rate has not match such a corresponding increase. It still takes approximately 10 minutes to mine a block and add it to the chain. This limitation highlights the importance of seeking scale-up solutions that solve the low throughput transaction rates. Blockchain's consensus mechanisms make peer-to-peer transactions becomes feasible and effectively eliminate the need for centralized control. However, the decentralized systems also causes a lower speed and throughput compared to centralized networks as we mentioned Bitcoin's block creation rates. Two mainstreams scale-up solutions, Layer 1 scale-up and Layer 2 scale-up have been implemented to address these issues. Layer 1 level scalability enhancements happen at where traditional blockchain operates. This paper provides a deep examination of the components of the Layer 1 protocol and the scale-up methods that directly improve the lower level blockchain. We also address that Layer 1 solutions encounter inherent limitations although improvements were applied due to layer 1 storage costs and latency are high. In addition, we discuss layer 2 protocols, advanced scalability techniques, that elevate blockchain performance by handling transactions off the mainnet. Our findings indicate that Layer 2 protocols, with their various implementations such as rollups and channels, significantly outperform Layer 1 solutions in terms of transaction throughput and efficiency. This paper discusses these Layer 2 scaling methods in detail, aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of these protocols and the underlying logic that drives their effectiveness. |

Compared to Ethereum, however, we observe a lack of research on how Solana smart contract developers handle security, what challenges they encounter, and how this affects the overall security of the ecosystem. To address this, we conducted the first comprehensive study on the Solana platform consisting of a 90-minute Solana smart contract code review task with 35 participants followed by interviews with a subset of seven participants. Our study shows, quite alarmingly, that none of the participants could detect all important security vulnerabilities in a code review task and that 83% of the participants are likely to release vulnerable smart contracts. Our study also sheds light on the root causes of developers' challenges with Solana smart contract development, suggesting the need for better security guidance and resources. In spite of these challenges, our automated analysis on currently deployed Solana smart contracts surprisingly suggests that the prevalence of vulnerabilities - especially those pointed out as the most challenging in our developer study - is below 0.3%. We explore the causes of this counter-intuitive resilience and show that frameworks, such as Anchor, are aiding Solana developers in deploying secure contracts. |

In traditional finance, there are possibilities to create values, e.g., arbitrage offers to create value from market inefficiencies or front-running offers to extract value for the participants having privileged roles. Such opportunities are readily available -- searching programmatically in DeFi. It is commonly known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in the literature. In this survey, first, we show how lucrative such opportunities can be. Next, we discuss how protocol-following participants trying to capture such opportunities threaten to sabotage blockchain's performance and the core tenets of decentralization, transparency, and trustlessness that blockchains are based on. Then, we explain different attempts by the community in the past to address these issues and the problems introduced by these solutions. Finally, we review the current state of research trying to restore trustlessness and decentralization to provide all DeFi participants with a fair marketplace. |

In light of this, this work introduces a novel private blockchain system named DCS Chain. The core idea is to quantify the DCS metrics and dynamically adjust the blockchain's performance across these three dimensions, to achieve theoretically optimal system performance. Overall, our system provides a comprehensive suite of blockchain essentials, including DCS quantification, consensus protocol adjustment, and communication network simulation. |

The specification of coefficients is referred to as an {\em instantiation} of the topology. In this paper, we propose a new block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$ parameterized by integers $\rho \geq 2$, $\omega \geq 1$, $\lambda \geq 2$, and $\mu$ a multiple of $\lambda$. In this topology, the code has $\mu$ local codes with $\rho$ parity-check (p-c) constraints and a total of $\mu\rho$ p-c equations fully define the code. Next, we construct a class of block circulant (BC) codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ with blocklength $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, dimension $k=\mu\omega$ that instantiate $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. Every local code of ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$ is a $[\rho+\lambda\omega,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized Reed-Solomon (RS) code. The overlap between supports of local codes helps to enhance the minimum distance $\rho+1$ to $2\rho+1$, without compromising much on the rate. We provide an efficient, parallelizable decoding algorithm to correct $2\rho$ erasures when $\lambda=2$ . Finally, we illustrate that the BC codes serve as a viable alternative to 2D RS codes in protocols designed to tackle blockchain networks' data availability (DA) problem. In these protocols, every node in a network of light nodes randomly queries symbols from a codeword stored in full nodes and verifies them using a cryptographic commitment scheme. For the same performance in tackling the DA problem, the BC code requires querying a smaller number of symbols than a comparable 2D RS code for a fixed high rate. Furthermore, the number of local codes in the BC code is typically smaller, yielding a reduction in the complexity of realizing the commitment scheme. |

However, collaboration among different agencies, each with its own blockchains, creates challenges due to diverse protocols and a lack of interoperability, hindering seamless information sharing. Cross-chain technology has been introduced to address these challenges. Current research about blockchains in digital forensics, tends to focus on individual agencies, lacking a comprehensive approach to collaboration and the essential aspect of cross-chain functionality. This emphasizes the necessity for a framework capable of effectively addressing challenges in securely sharing case information, implementing access controls, and capturing provenance data across interconnected blockchains. Our solution, ForensiCross, is the first cross-chain solution specifically designed for digital forensics and provenance. It includes BridgeChain and features a unique communication protocol for cross-chain and multi-chain solutions. ForensiCross offers meticulous provenance capture and extraction methods, mathematical analysis to ensure reliability, scalability considerations for a distributed intermediary in collaborative blockchain contexts, and robust security measures against potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Analysis and evaluation results indicate that ForensiCross is secure and, despite a slight increase in communication time, outperforms in node count efficiency and has secure provenance extraction. As an all-encompassing solution, ForensiCross aims to simplify collaborative investigations by ensuring data integrity and traceability. |

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based copyright traceability framework called ring oscillator-singular value decomposition (RO-SVD), which introduces decomposition computing to approximate low-rank matrices generated from hardware entropy sources and establishes an AI-generated content (AIGC) copyright traceability mechanism at the device level. By leveraging the parallelism and reconfigurability of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), our framework can be easily constructed on existing AI-accelerated devices and provide a low-cost solution to emerging copyright issues of AIGC. We developed a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design prototype based on comprehensive analysis and on-board experiments with multiple AI-applicable FPGAs. Using AI-generated images as a case study, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and emphasised customisation, unpredictability, efficiency, management and reconfigurability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical hardware study discussing and implementing copyright traceability specifically for AI-generated content. |

Applicants must present credentials that employers can trust without delays or risk of fraudulent information. This paper introduces a framework for managing digital resum\'e credentials using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. We propose a framework for the issuance and verification of Verifiable Credentials in real time without intermediaries.

The transition from centralized to decentralized systems presents challenges such as trust distribution and privacy-preserving credential management. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems is motivated by addressing the single points of failure inherent in centralized systems and leveraging decentralized technologies' transparency and resilience. This paper explores the evolution of certificate status management from centralized to decentralized frameworks, focusing on blockchain technology and advanced cryptography. We provide a taxonomy of the challenges of centralized systems and discuss opportunities provided by existing decentralized technologies. Our findings reveal that, although blockchain technologies enhance security and trust distribution, they represent a bottleneck for parallel computation and face inefficiencies in cryptographic computations. For this reason, we propose a framework of decentralized technology components that addresses such shortcomings to advance the paradigm shift toward decentralized credential status management. |

These issues stem from data silos and communication barriers. This research introduces DIDChain, a framework leveraging blockchain technology, Decentralized Identifiers, and the InterPlanetary File System. DIDChain improves supply chain data management. To address privacy concerns, DIDChain employs a hybrid blockchain architecture that combines public blockchain transparency with the control of private systems. Our hybrid approach preserves the authenticity and reliability of supply chain events. It also respects the data privacy requirements of the participants in the supply chain. Central to DIDChain is the cheqd infrastructure. The cheqd infrastructure enables digital tracing of asset events, such as an asset moving from the milk-producing dairy farm to the cheese manufacturer. In this research, assets are raw materials and products. The cheqd infrastructure ensures the traceability and reliability of assets in the management of supply chain data. Our contribution to blockchain-enabled supply chain systems demonstrates the robustness of DIDChain. Integrating blockchain technology through DIDChain offers a solution to data silos and communication barriers. With DIDChain, we propose a framework to transform the supply chain infrastructure across industries. |

While offering numerous advantages, these components expose various attack surfaces, leading to severe threats to blockchains. In this study, we unveil a novel attack surface, i.e., the state storage, in blockchains. The state storage, based on the Merkle Patricia Trie, plays a crucial role in maintaining blockchain state. Besides, we design Nurgle, the first Denial-of-Service attack targeting the state storage. By proliferating intermediate nodes within the state storage, Nurgle forces blockchains to expend additional resources on state maintenance and verification, impairing their performance. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of Nurgle, including the factors affecting it, its impact on blockchains, its financial cost, and practically demonstrating the resulting damage to blockchains. The implications of Nurgle extend beyond the performance degradation of blockchains, potentially reducing trust in them and the value of their cryptocurrencies. Additionally, we further discuss three feasible mitigations against Nurgle. At the time of writing, the vulnerability exploited by Nurgle has been confirmed by six mainstream blockchains, and we received thousands of USD bounty from them. |

We introduce a model for elections with a binary outcome space where there is a ground truth (i.e., a "correct" outcome), and where stakeholders can only choose to delegate their voting power to a set of delegation representatives (DReps). Moreover, the effort (cost) invested by each DRep positively influences both (i) her ability to vote correctly and (ii) the total delegation that she attracts, thereby increasing her voting power. This model constitutes the natural counterpart of delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, where delegated stakes are used to elect the block builders.   As a way to motivate the representatives to exert effort, a reward scheme can be used based on the delegation attracted by each DRep. We analyze both the game-theoretic aspects and the optimization counterpart of this model. Our primary focus is on selecting a committee that maximizes the probability of reaching the correct outcome, given a fixed monetary budget allocated for rewarding the delegates. Our findings provide insights into the design of effective reward mechanisms and optimal committee structures (i.e., how many DReps are enough) in these PoS-like governance systems. |

This requirement becomes particularly burdensome when the contract state contains dynamic data structures, as needed in many use cases to track interactions between users and the contract. The problem is twofold: on the one hand, a large state in transactions implies a large transaction fee; on the other hand, a large centralized state is detrimental to the parallelization of transactions - a feature that is often cited as a key advantage of UTXO-based blockchains over account-based ones. We propose a technique to efficiently execute smart contracts on an extended UTXO blockchain, which allows the contract state to be distributed across multiple UTXOs. In this way, transactions only need to specify the part of the state they need to access, reducing their size (and fees). We show how to exploit our model to parallelize the validation of transactions on multi-core CPUs. We implement our technique and provide an empirical validation of its effectiveness. |

The Metaverse has enormous potential to transform healthcare by changing patient care, medical education, and the way teaching/learning and research are done. The purpose of this research is to provide an introduction to the basic concepts and fundamental technologies of the Metaverse. This paper examines the pros and cons of the Metaverse in healthcare context and analyzes its potential from the technology and AI perspective. In particular, the role of machine learning methods is discussed; We will explain how machine learning algorithms can be applied to the Metaverse generated data to gain better insights in healthcare applications. Additionally, we examine the future visions of the Metaverse in health delivery, by examining emerging technologies such as blockchain and also addressing privacy concerns. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the applications of Metaverse in healthcare and its potential to revolutionize the delivery of medical services. |

First, we consider how effort in terms of resources required to process and store a transaction turns into a gas limit, which, through a fee, comprised of the base and priority fee in the current version of Ethereum, is converted into the cost paid by the user. We adhere closely to the Ethereum protocol to simplify the analysis and to constrain the design choices when considering multidimensional gas. Second, we assume that the gas price is given deus ex machina by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and evaluate various derivatives. These contracts can, for example, mitigate gas cost volatility. The ability to price and trade forwards besides the existing spot inclusion into the blockchain could enable users to hedge against future cost fluctuations. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of gas fee dynamics on the Ethereum blockchain, integrating supply-side constraints with demand-side modelling to enhance the predictability and stability of transaction costs. |
|**2024-06-10**|**Should my Blockchain Learn to Drive? A Study of Hyperledger Fabric**|Jeeta Ann Chacko et.al.|[2406.06318](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06318)| Similar to other transaction processing frameworks, blockchain systems need to be dynamically reconfigured to adapt to varying workloads and changes in network conditions. However, achieving optimal reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the blockchain stack, which has diverse configurable parameters. This paper explores the concept of self-driving blockchains, which have the potential to predict workload changes and reconfigure themselves for optimal performance without human intervention. We compare and contrast our discussions with existing research on databases and highlight aspects unique to blockchains. We identify specific parameters and components in Hyperledger Fabric, a popular permissioned blockchain system, that are suitable for autonomous adaptation and offer potential solutions for the challenges involved. Further, we implement three demonstrative locally autonomous systems, each targeting a different layer of the blockchain stack, and conduct experiments to understand the feasibility of our findings. Our experiments indicate up to 11% improvement in success throughput and a 30% decrease in latency, making this a significant step towards implementing a fully autonomous blockchain system in the future. |

The robustness of established blockchains presents an opportunity to leverage their infrastructure for creating expansion chains. Expansion chains can provide additional functionality to the primary chain they leverage or implement separate functionalities, while benefiting from the primary chain's security and the stability of its tokens. Indeed, tools like Ethereum's EigenLayer enable nodes to stake (deposit collateral) on a primary chain to form a committee responsible for operating an expansion chain.   But here is the rub. Classical protocols assume correct, well-behaved nodes stay correct indefinitely. Yet in our case, the stake incentivizes correctness--it will be slashed (revoked) if its owner deviates. Once a node withdraws its stake, there is no basis to assume its correctness.   To address the new challenge, we present Aegis, an expansion chain based on primary-chain stake, assuming a bounded primary-chain write time. Aegis uses references from Aegis blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets on the primary chain to establish a new committee if the previous one becomes obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low. |
|**2024-06-09**|**Demystifying the Characteristics for Smart Contract Upgrades**|Ye Liu et.al.|[2406.05712](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05712)| Upgradable smart contracts play an important role in the decentralized application ecosystem, to support routine maintenance, security patching, and feature additions. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on proxy-based upgradable smart contracts to understand the characteristics of contract upgrading. Through our study on 57,118 open source proxy contracts, we found that 583 contracts have ever been upgraded on Ethereum, involving 973 unique implementation contract versions. The results show that developers often intend to improve usability of contracts if upgrading, where functionality addition and update are the most frequent upgrade intentions. We investigated the practical impacts of contract upgrades, e.g., breaking changes causing compatibility issues, storage collisions and initialization risks leading to security vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that there are 4,334 ABI breaking changes due to the upgrades of 276 proxies, causing real-world broken usages within 584 transactions witnessed by the blockchain; 36 contract upgrades had storage collisions and five proxies with 59 implementation contracts are vulnerable to initialization attacks. |

They are smart contracts (stateful programs) running on blockchains. They enable virtual token exchange: Traders swap tokens with the AMM for a fee, while liquidity providers supply liquidity and earn these fees. Demand for AMMs is growing rapidly, but our experiment-based estimates show that current architectures cannot meet the projected demand by 2029. This is because the execution of existing AMMs is non-parallelizable.   We present SAMM, an AMM comprising multiple shards. All shards are AMMs running on the same chain, but their independence enables parallel execution. Unlike classical sharding solutions, here security relies on incentive compatibility. Therefore, SAMM introduces a novel fee design. Through analysis of Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE), we show that SAMM incentivizes the desired behavior: Liquidity providers balance liquidity among all shards, overcoming destabilization attacks, and trades are evenly distributed. We validate our game-theoretic analysis with a simulation using real-world data.   We evaluate SAMM by implementing and deploying it on local testnets of the Sui and Solana blockchains. To our knowledge, this is the first quantification of ``hot-contract'' performance. SAMM improves throughput by 5x and 16x, respectively, potentially more with better parallelization of the underlying blockchains. It is directly deployable, mitigating the upcoming scaling bottleneck. |

Rajagopal et.al.|[2406.05517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05517)| Modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications generate enormous amounts of data, making data-driven machine learning essential for developing precise and reliable statistical models. However, data is often stored in silos, and strict user-privacy legislation complicates data utilization, limiting machine learning's potential in traditional centralized paradigms due to diverse data probability distributions and lack of personalization. Federated learning, a new distributed paradigm, supports collaborative learning while preserving privacy, making it ideal for IoT applications. By employing cryptographic techniques, IoT systems can securely store and transmit data, ensuring consistency. The integration of federated learning and blockchain is particularly advantageous for handling sensitive data, such as in healthcare. Despite the potential of these technologies, a comprehensive examination of their integration in edge-fog-cloud-based IoT computing systems and healthcare applications is needed. This survey article explores the architecture, structure, functions, and characteristics of federated learning and blockchain, their applications in various computing paradigms, and evaluates their implementations in healthcare. |

Ahsan Habib et.al.|[2406.05151](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05151)| University education play a critical role in shaping intellectual and professional development of the individuals and contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge and society. Generally, university authority has a direct control of students result making and stores the credential in their local dedicated server. So, there is chance to alter the credential and also have a very high possibility to encounter various threats and different security attacks. To resolve these, we propose a blockchain based secure credential management system (BCMS) for efficiently storing, managing and recovering credential without involving the university authority. The proposed BCMS incorporates a modified two factor encryption (m2FE) technique, a combination of RSA cryptosystem and a DNA encoding to ensure credential privacy and an enhanced authentication scheme for teachers and students. Besides, to reduce size of the cipher credential and its conversion time, we use character to integer (C2I) table instead of ASCII table. Finally, the experimental result and analysis of the BCMS illustrate the effectiveness over state of the art works. |
|**2024-06-10**|**Optimizing Exit Queues for Proof-of-Stake Blockchains: A Mechanism Design Approach**|Michael Neuder et.al.|[2406.05124](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05124)| Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols have provable safety and liveness properties for static validator sets. In practice, however, the validator set changes over time, potentially eroding the protocol's security guarantees. For example, systems with accountable safety may lose some of that accountability over time as adversarial validators exit. As a result, protocols must rate limit entry and exit so that the set changes slowly enough to ensure security. Here, the system designer faces a fundamental trade-off. Slower exits increase friction, making it less attractive to stake in the first place. Faster exits provide more utility to stakers but weaken the protocol's security.   This paper provides the first systematic study of exit queues for Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Given a collection of validator-set consistency constraints imposed by the protocol, the social planner's goal is to provide a constrained-optimal mechanism that minimizes disutility for the participants. We introduce the MINSLACK mechanism, a dynamic capacity first-come-first-served queue in which the amount of stake that can exit in a period depends on the number of previous exits and the consistency constraints. We show that MINSLACK is optimal when stakers equally value the processing of their withdrawal. When stakers values are heterogeneous, the optimal mechanism resembles a priority queue with dynamic capacity. However, this mechanism must reserve exit capacity for the future in case a staker with a much higher need for liquidity arrives. We conclude with a survey of known consistency constraints and highlight the diversity of existing exit mechanisms. |
|**2024-06-07**|**When Swarm Learning meets energy series data: A decentralized collaborative learning design based on blockchain**|Lei Xu et.al.|[2406.04743](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04743)| Machine learning models offer the capability to forecast future energy production or consumption and infer essential unknown variables from existing data. However, legal and policy constraints within specific energy sectors render the data sensitive, presenting technical hurdles in utilizing data from diverse sources. Therefore, we propose adopting a Swarm Learning (SL) scheme, which replaces the centralized server with a blockchain-based distributed network to address the security and privacy issues inherent in Federated Learning (FL)'s centralized architecture. Within this distributed Collaborative Learning framework, each participating organization governs nodes for inter-organizational communication. Devices from various organizations utilize smart contracts for parameter uploading and retrieval. Consensus mechanism ensures distributed consistency throughout the learning process, guarantees the transparent trustworthiness and immutability of parameters on-chain. The efficacy of the proposed framework is substantiated across three real-world energy series modeling scenarios with superior performance compared to Local Learning approaches, simultaneously emphasizing enhanced data security and privacy over Centralized Learning and FL method. Notably, as the number of data volume and the count of local epochs increases within a threshold, there is an improvement in model performance accompanied by a reduction in the variance of performance errors. Consequently, this leads to an increased stability and reliability in the outcomes produced by the model. |
|**2024-06-07**|**Unveiling Dynamics and Patterns: A Comprehensive Analysis of Spreading Patterns and Similarities in Low-Labelled Ransomware Families**|Francesco Zola et.al.|[2406.04719](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04719)| Ransomware has become one of the most widespread threats, primarily due to its easy deployment and the accessibility to services that enable attackers to raise and obfuscate funds. This latter aspect has been significantly enhanced with the advent of cryptocurrencies, which, by fostering decentralisation and anonymity, have transformed this threat into a large-scale outbreak. However, recent reports indicate that a small group of individuals dominate the ransomware ecosystem and try to obfuscate their activity using multiple strains characterised by a short time to live. This scenario suggests that different strains could share mechanisms in ransom collection, fund movement, and money laundering operations. For this reason, this study aims to analyse the address-transaction graphs generated in the Bitcoin network by low-labelled ransomware families. Our goals are to identify payment spreading patterns for evaluating the evolution of ransomware families and to detect similarities among different strains that potentially can be controlled by the same attacker. Specifically, this latter task assigns an address behaviour to each node in the address-transaction graphs according to its dynamics. The distribution of the behaviours in each strain is finally used to evaluate the closeness among different ransomware families. Our findings show that although ransomware families can quickly establish connections with millions of addresses, numerous families require multiple-step analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the introduced behaviours can effectively be used to highlight similarities among different ransomware strains. The outcome shows that families are similar primarily due to behaviours usually associated with ransom collection and money laundering operations.+ |
|**2024-06-07**|**Marking the Pace: A Blockchain-Enhanced Privacy-Traceable Strategy for Federated Recommender Systems**|Zhen Cai et.al.|[2406.04702](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04702)| Federated recommender systems have been crucially enhanced through data sharing and continuous model updates, attributed to the pervasive connectivity and distributed computing capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Given the sensitivity of IoT data, transparent data processing in data sharing and model updates is paramount. However, existing methods fall short in tracing the flow of shared data and the evolution of model updates. Consequently, data sharing is vulnerable to exploitation by malicious entities, raising significant data privacy concerns, while excluding data sharing will result in sub-optimal recommendations. To mitigate these concerns, we present LIBERATE, a privacy-traceable federated recommender system. We design a blockchain-based traceability mechanism, ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model updates. We further enhance privacy protection by incorporating local differential privacy in user-server communication. Extensive evaluations with the real-world dataset corroborate LIBERATE's capabilities in ensuring data privacy during data sharing and model update while maintaining efficiency and performance. Results underscore blockchain-based traceability mechanism as a promising solution for privacy-preserving in federated recommender systems. |
|**2024-06-06**|**Federated TrustChain: Blockchain-Enhanced LLM Training and Unlearning**|Xuhan Zuo et.al.|[2406.04076](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04076)| The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a significant challenge: the exhausting of publicly available fresh data. This is because training a LLM needs a large demanding of new data. Federated learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model to contribute their private data to LLM global model. However, integrating federated learning with LLMs introduces new challenges, including the lack of transparency and the need for effective unlearning mechanisms. Transparency is essential to ensuring trust and fairness among participants, while accountability is crucial for deterring malicious behaviour and enabling corrective actions when necessary. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based federated learning framework for LLMs that enhances transparency, accountability, and unlearning capabilities. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of each model's contributions and introduces an innovative unlearning function that seamlessly integrates with the federated learning mechanism. We investigate the impact of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) hyperparameters on unlearning performance and integrate Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the security, transparency, and verifiability of the unlearning process. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework in achieving highly effective unlearning in LLMs trained using federated learning. Our findings highlight the feasibility of integrating blockchain technology into federated learning frameworks for LLMs. |

The centrality of this framework represents a point of failure which is addressed in literature by blockchain-based federated learning approaches. While ensuring a fully-decentralized solution with traceability, such approaches still face several challenges about integrity, confidentiality and scalability to be practically deployed. In this paper, we propose Fantastyc, a solution designed to address these challenges that have been never met together in the state of the art. |
|**2024-06-04**|**Fast and Secure Decentralized Optimistic Rollups Using Setchain**|Margarita Capretto et.al.|[2406.02316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02316)| Modern blockchains face a scalability challenge due to the intrinsic throughput limitations of consensus protocols. Layer 2 optimistic rollups (L2) are a faster alternative that offer the same interface in terms of smart contract development and user interaction. Optimistic rollups perform most computations offchain and make light use of an underlying blockchain (L1) to guarantee correct behavior, implementing a cheaper blockchain on a blockchain solution. With optimistic rollups, a sequencer calculates offchain batches of L2 transactions and commits batches (compressed or hashed) to the L1 blockchain. The use of hashes requires a data service to translate hashes into their corresponding batches. Current L2 implementations consist of a centralized sequencer (central authority) and an optional data availability committee (DAC).   In this paper, we propose a decentralized L2 optimistic rollup based on Setchain, a decentralized Byzantine-tolerant implementation of sets. The main contribution is a fully decentralized "arranger" where arrangers are a formal definition combining sequencers and DACs. We prove our implementation correct and show empirical evidence that our solution scales. A final contribution is a system of incentives (payments) for servers that implement the sequencer and data availability committee protocols correctly, and a fraud-proof mechanism to detect violations of the protocol. |

Issues such as data privacy risks, service disruptions, and substantial expansion costs have emerged. To address these challenges, an innovative network architecture called Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) has emerged. DePIN leverages blockchain technology to decentralize the control and management of physical devices, addressing limitations of traditional infrastructure network. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of DePIN, presenting its five-layer architecture, key design principles. Furthermore, it presents a detailed survey of the extant applications, operating mechanisms, and provides an in-depth analysis of market data pertaining to DePIN. Finally, it discusses a wide range of the open challenges faced by DePIN. |

Over recent years, we observe a shift in trading activities from Ethereum to rollups, with swaps on rollups occurring 2-3 times more frequently, albeit with lower trade volumes. By analyzing the costs of swap on L2s and price discrepancies cross-rollup and DEX-CEX, we identify more than 500 000 unexplored arbitrage opportunities. In particular, we find that these opportunities persist, on average, for 10 to 20 blocks, necessitating the modification of the Loss Versus Rebalancing (LVR) metric to prevent double-counting. Our findings indicate that the arbitrage opportunities in Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism range between 0.03% and 0.05% of the trading volume, while in the ZKsync it fluctuates around 0.25%. |
|**2024-07-12**|**It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma**|Zishuo Zhao et.al.|[2406.01794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794)| The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.   In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems. |

Pritchard et.al.|[2406.01146](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01146)| Computational workflow management systems power contemporary data-intensive sciences. The slowly resolving reproducibility crisis presents both a sobering warning and an opportunity to iterate on what science and data processing entails. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world's largest radio telescope, is among the most extensive scientific projects underway and presents grand scientific collaboration and data-processing challenges. This work presents a scale and system-agnostic computational workflow model and extends five well-known reproducibility tenets into seven defined for our workflow model. Subsequent implementation of these definitions, powered by blockchain primitives, into the Data Activated Flow Graph Engine (DALiuGE), a workflow management system for the SKA, demonstrates the possibility of facilitating automatic formal verification of scientific quality in amortized constant time. We validate our approach with a simple yet representative astronomical processing task; filtering a noisy signal with a lowpass filter with both CPU and GPU methods. Our framework illuminates otherwise obscure scientific discrepancies and similarities between principally identical workflow executions. |

To alleviate these issues, blockchain-aided decentralized FL (BDFL) introduces the decentralized network architecture into the FL training process, which can effectively overcome the defects of centralized architecture. However, deploying BDFL in wireless networks usually encounters challenges such as limited bandwidth, computing power, and energy consumption. Driven by these considerations, a dynamic stochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average training delay by jointly optimizing the resource allocation and client selection under the constraints of limited energy budget and client participation. We solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear programming problem by employing the tool of Lyapunov optimization and thereby propose the dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling BDFL (DRC-BDFL) algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze the learning performance of DRC-BDFL and derive an upper bound for convergence regarding the global loss function. Extensive experiments conducted on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that DRC-BDFL achieves comparable accuracy to baseline algorithms while significantly reducing the training delay by 9.24% and 12.47%, respectively. |
|**2024-06-02**|**Model-based Analysis of Mining Fairness in a Blockchain**|Akira Sakurai et.al.|[2406.00595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00595)| Mining fairness in blockchain refers to the equality between the computational resources invested in mining and the block rewards received. There exists a dilemma where increasing the blockchain's transaction processing capacity damages mining fairness, consequently undermining its decentralization. This dilemma remains unresolved even with methods such as GHOST, indicating that mining fairness is an inherent bottleneck to the system's transaction processing capacity. Despite its significance, there have been insufficient studies quantitatively analyzing mining fairness.   In this paper, we propose a method to calculate mining fairness. Initially, we approximate a complex blockchain network using a simple mathematical model, assuming that no more than two blocks are generated per round. Within this model, we quantitatively determine local mining fairness and derive several measures of global mining fairness based on local mining fairness.   We validated that our calculation method accurately computes mining fairness in networks with a small number of miners. Furthermore, we analyzed various networks from the perspective of mining fairness. |

Our proposed system offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing participants to select shared models and customize the aggregation for local needs, thereby optimizing system performance, including accurate inference results. Notably, the integration of blockchain technology in our work is to promote a trustless environment, ensuring transparency and non-repudiation among participants when abnormalities are detected. To validate the effectiveness, we conducted real-world federated learning deployments on a private Ethereum platform, using two different models, ranging from simple to complex neural networks. The experimental results indicate comparable inference accuracy between centralized and decentralized federated learning settings. Furthermore, our findings indicate that asynchronous aggregation is a feasible option for simple learning models. However, complex learning models require greater training model involvement in the aggregation to achieve high model quality, instead of asynchronous aggregation. With the implementation of asynchronous aggregation and the flexibility to select models, participants anticipate decreased aggregation time in each communication round, while experiencing minimal accuracy trade-off. |

Moallemi et.al.|[2406.00113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00113)| Milionis et al.(2023) studied the rate at which automated market makers leak value to arbitrageurs when block times are discrete and follow a Poisson process, and where the risky asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. We extend their model to analyze another popular mechanism in decentralized finance for onchain trading: Dutch auctions. We compute the expected losses that a seller incurs to arbitrageurs and expected time-to-fill for Dutch auctions as a function of starting price, volatility, decay rate, and average interblock time. We also extend the analysis to gradual Dutch auctions, a variation on Dutch auctions for selling tokens over time at a continuous rate. We use these models to explore the tradeoff between speed of execution and quality of execution, which could help inform practitioners in setting parameters for starting price and decay rate on Dutch auctions, or help platform designers determine performance parameters like block times. |

Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios. |
|**2024-05-30**|**SoK: Public Blockchain Sharding**|Md Mohaimin Al Barat et.al.|[2405.20521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20521)| Blockchain's decentralization, transparency, and tamper-resistance properties have facilitated the system's use in various application fields. However, the low throughput and high confirmation latency hinder the widespread adoption of Blockchain. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, including first-layer solutions (or on-chain solutions) and second-layer solutions (or off-chain solutions). Among the proposed solutions, the blockchain sharding system is the most scalable one, where the nodes in the network are divided into several groups. The nodes in different shards work in parallel to validate the transactions and add them to the blocks, and in such a way, the throughput increases significantly. However, previous works have not adequately summarized the latest achievements in blockchain sharding, nor have they fully showcased its state-of-the-art. Our study provides a systemization of knowledge of public blockchain sharding, including the core components of sharding systems, challenges, limitations, and mechanisms of the latest sharding protocols. We also compare their performance and discuss current constraints and future research directions. |

While effective for identifying transaction patterns indicative of fraud, it does not capture the semantics of transactions and is constrained to blockchain data. Consequently, preventive methods based on transaction graphs are inherently limited. In response to these limitations, we propose the Kosmosis approach, which aims to incrementally construct a knowledge graph as new blockchain and social media data become available. During construction, it aims to extract the semantics of transactions and connect blockchain addresses to their real-world entities by fusing blockchain and social media data in a knowledge graph. This enables novel preventive methods against rug pulls as a form of crypto asset fraud. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the Kosmosis approach, we examine a series of real-world rug pulls from 2021. Through this case, we illustrate how Kosmosis can aid in identifying and preventing such fraudulent activities by leveraging the insights from the constructed knowledge graph. |

However, without reliable third-party oversight, these methods risk security vulnerabilities during watermark extraction. Furthermore, digital media lacks tangible ownership attributes, posing challenges for secure copyright transfer and tracing. This study introduces DataSafe, a copyright protection scheme that combines physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and blockchain technology. PUF devices use their unique fingerprints for blockchain registration. Subsequently, these devices incorporate invisible watermarking techniques to embed digital watermarks into media for copyright protection. The watermark verification process is confined within the devices, preserving confidentiality during extraction, validating identities during copyright exchanges, and facilitating blockchain-based traceability of copyright transfers. The implementation of a prototype system on the LPC55S69-EVK development board is detailed, illustrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed solution. |

However, long has it been criticized for its tremendous and inefficient utilization of computational power and energy. In this work, we design a dual-functional blockchain framework that uses solving optimization problems to reach consensus as an alternative to PoW, channeling wasted resources into useful work. We model and analyze our framework by developing discrete Markov chains, and derive the security conditions to ensure that selfish miners behave honestly. Based on the security conditions, we derive a lower bound for the security overhead and analyze the trade-off between useful work efficiency and PoW safeguard. We further dive deep into the reward function design for the proposed dual-functional blockchain and provide practical design guidelines for reward functions assuming concavity and linearity respectively. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate and illustrate our analytical results. |
|**2024-05-29**|**On Fairness Concerns in the Blockchain Ecosystem**|Johnnatan Messias Peixoto Afonso et.al.|[2405.18876](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18876)| Blockchains revolutionized centralized sectors like banking and finance by promoting decentralization and transparency. In a blockchain, information is transmitted through transactions issued by participants or applications. Miners crucially select, order, and validate pending transactions for block inclusion, prioritizing those with higher incentives or fees. The order in which transactions are included can impact the blockchain final state. Moreover, applications running on top of a blockchain often rely on governance protocols to decentralize the decision-making power to make changes to their core functionality. These changes can affect how participants interact with these applications. Since one token equals one vote, participants holding multiple tokens have a higher voting power to support or reject the proposed changes. The extent to which this voting power is distributed is questionable and if highly concentrated among a few holders can lead to governance attacks. In this thesis, we audit the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to investigate the norms followed by miners in determining the transaction prioritization. We also audit decentralized governance protocols such as Compound to evaluate whether the voting power is fairly distributed among the participants. Our findings have significant implications for future developments of blockchains and decentralized applications. |
|**2024-10-10**|**Remeasuring the Arbitrage and Sandwich Attacks of Maximal Extractable Value in Ethereum**|Tianyang Chi et.al.|[2405.17944](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17944)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) drives the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem. By strategically including, excluding, or reordering transactions within blocks, block producers can extract additional value, which in turn incentivizes them to keep the decentralization of the whole blockchain platform. Before September 2022, around $675M was extracted in terms of MEV in Ethereum. Despite its importance, current work on identifying MEV activities suffers from two limitations. On the one hand, current methods heavily rely on clumsy heuristic rule-based patterns, leading to numerous false negatives or positives. On the other hand, the observations and conclusions are drawn from the early stage of Ethereum, which cannot be used as effective guiding principles after The Merge. To address these challenges, in this work, we innovatively proposed a profitability identification algorithm. Based on this, we designed two robust algorithms to identify MEV activities on our collected largest-ever dataset. Based on the identified results, we have characterized the overall landscape of the Ethereum MEV ecosystem, the impact the private transaction architectures bring in, and the adoption of back-running mechanisms. Our research sheds light on future MEV-related work. |
|**2024-05-30**|**Proof of Quality: A Costless Paradigm for Trustless Generative AI Model Inference on Blockchains**|Zhenjie Zhang et.al.|[2405.17934](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17934)| Generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated powerful and disruptive capabilities in natural language and image tasks. However, deploying these models in decentralized environments remains challenging. Unlike traditional centralized deployment, systematically guaranteeing the integrity of AI model services in fully decentralized environments, particularly on trustless blockchains, is both crucial and difficult. In this paper, we present a new inference paradigm called \emph{proof of quality} (PoQ) to enable the deployment of arbitrarily large generative models on blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional approaches based on validating inference procedures, such as ZKML or OPML, our PoQ paradigm focuses on the outcome quality of model inference. Using lightweight BERT-based cross-encoders as our underlying quality evaluation model, we design and implement PQML, the first practical protocol for real-world NLP generative model inference on blockchains, tailored for popular open-source models such as Llama 3 and Mixtral. Our analysis demonstrates that our protocol is robust against adversarial but rational participants in ecosystems, where lazy or dishonest behavior results in fewer benefits compared to well-behaving participants. The computational overhead of validating the quality evaluation is minimal, allowing quality validators to complete the quality check within a second, even using only a CPU. Preliminary simulation results show that PoQ consensus is generated in milliseconds, 1,000 times faster than any existing scheme. |
|**2024-05-28**|**Trustworthy DNN Partition for Blockchain-enabled Digital Twin in Wireless IIoT Networks**|Xiumei Deng et.al.|[2405.17914](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17914)| Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance manufacturing efficiency in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. To promote the efficiency and trustworthiness of DT for wireless IIoT networks, we propose a blockchain-enabled DT (B-DT) framework that employs deep neural network (DNN) partitioning technique and reputation-based consensus mechanism, wherein the DTs maintained at the gateway side execute DNN inference tasks using the data collected from their associated IIoT devices. First, we employ DNN partitioning technique to offload the top-layer DNN inference tasks to the access point (AP) side, which alleviates the computation burden at the gateway side and thereby improves the efficiency of DNN inference. Second, we propose a reputation-based consensus mechanism that integrates Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Specifically, the proposed consensus mechanism evaluates the off-chain reputation of each AP according to its computation resource contributions to the DNN inference tasks, and utilizes the off-chain reputation as a stake to adjust the block generation difficulty. Third, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem of communication resource (i.e., partition point) and computation resource allocation (i.e., computation frequency of APs for top-layer DNN inference and block generation) to minimize system latency under the time-varying channel state and long-term constraints of off-chain reputation, and solve the problem using Lyapunov optimization method. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic DNN partitioning and resource allocation (DPRA) algorithm outperforms the baselines in terms of reducing the overall latency while guaranteeing the trustworthiness of the B-DT system. |
|**2024-10-15**|**Serial Monopoly on Blockchains with Quasi-patient Users**|Paolo Penna et.al.|[2405.17334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17334)| In the face of limited block size, miners (e.g., in Bitcoin) prioritize high-bid transactions, forming a large part of their revenue. If the block size were to expand significantly, meeting all transaction demand due to infrastructure or protocol improvements, bids could drop to zero or to a minimum fee, reducing mining incentives and potentially affecting security. To address this, Lavi et al. (2022) introduced a monopolistic pricing mechanism where miners only include transactions paying a minimum price, ensuring some revenue but resulting in an unbounded loss in welfare. Nisan (2023) expands this by modeling bidders as patient, who wait indefinitely long for lower prices, causing price fluctuations even with stable demand. In order to capture users' diminishing interest in having their transactions added to the ledger over time, we consider a more realistic setting with quasi-patient users, where only a fraction $\delta \in [0,1]$ of pending transactions remains in the next round. This richer model encompasses both Lavi et al.'s impatient users ($\delta=0$) and Nisan's patient users ($\delta=1$) as special cases. We demonstrate that Nisan's fluctuating dynamics persist for $\delta$ close to 1, while for $\delta$ close to 0, the dynamics resemble the impatient case. For $\delta \in (0,1)$, we establish new bounds on price dynamics, revealing unexpected effects. Unlike the fully patient case, the bounds of the dynamics for $\delta<1$ depend on the demand curve and undergo a "transition phase". For some $\delta$, the model mirrors the fully patient setting, and for smaller $\delta' < \delta$, it stabilizes at the highest monopolist price, thus collapsing to the impatient case. We provide quantitative bounds and analytical results, showing that the bounds for $\delta=1$ are generally not tight for $\delta<1$ , and we give guarantees on the minimum ("admission") price for transactions. |

This study explores the various complex difficulties which contributed to the early decommissioning of IoT devices and suggests methods to improve their lifespan management. By examining factors such as security vulnerabilities, user awareness gaps, and the influence of fashion-driven technology trends, the paper underscores the need for legislative interventions, consumer education, and industry accountability. Additionally, it explores innovative approaches to improving IoT longevity, including the integration of sustainability considerations into architectural design through requirements engineering methodologies. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to promote transparent and decentralized processes for device provisioning and tracking.

|**2024-05-24**|**Collaborative Access Control for IoT -- A Blockchain Approach**|Yongtao Huang et.al.|[2405.15749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15749)| The Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates robust access control mechanisms to secure a vast array of interconnected devices. Most of the existing IoT systems in practice use centralized solutions. We identify the problems in such solutions and adopt the blockchain based decentralized access control approach. Though there are works in the literature that use blockchain for access control, there are some gaps in these works. We develop a blockchain embedded access control (BEAC) framework to bridge the gaps. First, blockchain based solutions for access control require an enabling P2P network while existing P2P overlays do not support some required features. We develop a novel P2P infrastructure to seamlessly support our BEAC framework. Second, most of the works consider blockchain based access control for a single access control model, and we develop a generic blockchain mechanism and show that it can support the embedding of various access control models. Finally, existing works adopt existing blockchain mechanisms which may incur a high communication overhead. We develop a shortcut approach to improve the number of message rounds in the access protocol. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our system, showing that the shortcut mechanism can reduces access time by approximately 43%. |
|**2024-06-26**|**D-VRE: From a Jupyter-enabled Private Research Environment to Decentralized Collaborative Research Ecosystem**|Yuandou Wang et.al.|[2405.15392](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15392)| Today, scientific research is increasingly data-centric and compute-intensive, relying on data and models across distributed sources. However, it still faces challenges in the traditional cooperation mode, due to the high storage and computing cost, geo-location barriers, and local confidentiality regulations. The Jupyter environment has recently emerged and evolved as a vital virtual research environment for scientific computing, which researchers can use to scale computational analyses up to larger datasets and high-performance computing resources. Nevertheless, existing approaches lack robust support of a decentralized cooperation mode to unlock the full potential of decentralized collaborative scientific research, e.g., seamlessly secure data sharing. In this work, we change the basic structure and legacy norms of current research environments via the seamless integration of Jupyter with Ethereum blockchain capabilities. As such, it creates a Decentralized Virtual Research Environment (D-VRE) from private computational notebooks to decentralized collaborative research ecosystem. We propose a novel architecture for the D-VRE and prototype some essential D-VRE elements for enabling secure data sharing with decentralized identity, user-centric agreement-making, membership, and research asset management. To validate our method, we conducted an experimental study to test all functionalities of D-VRE smart contracts and their gas consumption. In addition, we deployed the D-VRE prototype on a test net of the Ethereum blockchain for demonstration. The feedback from the studies showcases the current prototype's usability, ease of use, and potential and suggests further improvements. |
|**2024-05-24**|**Transaction Fee Estimation in the Bitcoin System**|Limeng Zhang et.al.|[2405.15293](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15293)| In the Bitcoin system, transaction fees serve as an incentive for blockchain confirmations. In general, a transaction with a higher fee is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with a smaller fee or no fee may be delayed or never processed at all. However, the transaction fee needs to be specified when submitting a transaction and almost cannot be altered thereafter. Hence it is indispensable to help a client set a reasonable fee, as a higher fee incurs over-spending and a lower fee could delay the confirmation. In this work, we focus on estimating the transaction fee for a new transaction to help with its confirmation within a given expected time. We identify two major drawbacks in the existing works. First, the current industry products are built on explicit analytical models, ignoring the complex interactions of different factors which could be better captured by machine learning based methods; Second, all of the existing works utilize limited knowledge for the estimation which hinders the potential of further improving the estimation quality. As a result, we propose a framework FENN, which aims to integrate the knowledge from a wide range of sources, including the transaction itself, unconfirmed transactions in the mempool and the blockchain confirmation environment, into a neural network model in order to estimate a proper transaction fee. Finally, we conduct experiments on real blockchain datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art works evaluated by MAPE and RMSE. Each variation model in our framework can finish training within one block interval, which shows the potential of our framework to process the realtime transaction updates in the Bitcoin blockchain. |

To address this, we present a data-driven analysis of the transaction surge in late 2023 and early 2024, attributed to inscriptions -- a method for recording data on the blockchain. Initially introduced on Bitcoin, inscriptions enable the representation of NFTs or ERC-20-like tokens without smart contracts, and have since expanded to other blockchains. This paper examines inscription-related transactions on Ethereum and major EVM-compatible rollups, assessing their impact on scalability during transaction surges. Our results show that, on certain days, inscriptions accounted nearly 90% of transactions on Arbitrum and ZKsync Era, while 53% on Ethereum, with 99% of these inscriptions involving meme coin minting. Furthermore, we show that ZKsync and Arbitrum saw lower median gas fees during these surges. ZKsync Era, a ZK-rollup, showed a greater fee reduction than the optimistic rollups studied -- Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Targeted Nakamoto: A Bitcoin Protocol to Balance Network Security and Energy Consumption**|Daniel Aronoff et.al.|[2405.15089](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15089)| In a Proof-of-Work blockchain such as Bitcoin mining hashrate is increasing in the block reward. An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Fast Transaction Scheduling in Blockchain Sharding**|Ramesh Adhikari et.al.|[2405.15015](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15015)| Sharding is a promising technique for addressing the scalability issues of blockchain. It divides the $n$ participating nodes into $s$ disjoint groups called shards, where each shard processes transactions in parallel. We investigate scheduling algorithms for the blockchain sharding systems, where each transaction resides in a shard of the communication graph and attempts to access accounts at possibly remote shards. We examine batch scheduling problems on the shard graph $G_s$, where given a set of transactions, we aim to find efficient schedules to execute them as fast as possible. First, we present a centralized scheduler where one of the shards has global knowledge of transactions to be processed. For general graphs, where the transaction and its accessing objects are arbitrarily far from each other with a maximum distance $d$, the centralized scheduler provides $O(kd)$ approximation to the optimal schedule, where $k$ is the maximum number of shards each transaction accesses. Consequently, for a Clique graph where shards are at a unit distance from each other, we obtain $O(k)$ approximation to the optimal schedule. We also get $O(k \log s)$ approximation for Hypercube, Butterfly, and $g$-dimensional Grid, where $g=O(\log s)$. Next, we provide a centralized scheduler with a bucketing approach that offers improved bounds for special cases. Finally, we provide a distributed scheduler where shards do not require global transaction information. We achieve this by using a hierarchical clustering of the shards and using the centralized scheduler in each cluster. We show that the distributed scheduler has a competitive ratio of $O(\mathcal{A_\mathcal{CS}} \log ^2 s)$, where $\mathcal{A_\mathcal{CS}}$ is the approximation ratio of the centralized scheduler. To our knowledge, we are the first to give provably fast transaction scheduling algorithms for blockchain sharding systems. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Dynamically Sharded Ledgers on a Distributed Hash Table**|Christoffer Fink et.al.|[2405.14991](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14991)| Distributed ledger technology such as blockchain is considered essential for supporting large numbers of micro-transactions in the Machine Economy, which is envisioned to involve billions of connected heterogeneous and decentralized cyber-physical systems. This stresses the need for performance and scalability of distributed ledger technologies. Sharding divides the blockchain network into multiple committees and is a common approach to improve scalability. However, with current sharding approaches, costly cross-shard verification is needed to prevent double-spending. This paper proposes a novel and more scalable distributed ledger method named ScaleGraph that implements dynamic sharding by using routing and logical proximity concepts from distributed hash tables. ScaleGraph addresses cyber security in terms of integrity, availability, and trust, to support frequent micro-transactions between autonomous devices. Benefits of ScaleGraph include a total storage space complexity of O(t), where t is the global number of transactions (assuming a constant replication degree). This space is sharded over n nodes so that each node needs O(t/n) storage, which provides a high level of concurrency and data localization as compared to other delegated consensus proposals. ScaleGraph allows for a dynamic grouping of validators which are selected based on a distance metric. We analyze the consensus requirements in such a dynamic setting and show that a synchronous consensus protocol allows shards to be smaller than an asynchronous one, and likely yields better performance. Moreover, we provide an experimental analysis of security aspects regarding the required size of the consensus groups with ScaleGraph. Our analysis shows that dynamic sharding based on proximity concepts brings attractive scalability properties in general, especially when the fraction of corrupt nodes is small. |
|**2024-05-23**|**Towards an Optimal Staking Design: Balancing Security, User Growth, and Token Appreciation**|Nicolas Oderbolz et.al.|[2405.14617](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14617)| This paper examines the economic and security implications of Proof-of-Stake (POS) designs, providing a survey of POS design choices and their underlying economic principles in prominent POS-blockchains. The paper argues that POS-blockchains are essentially platforms that connect three groups of agents: users, validators, and investors. To meet the needs of these groups, blockchains must balance trade-offs between security, user adoption, and investment into the protocol. We focus on the security aspect and identify two different strategies: increasing the quality of validators (static security) vs. increasing the quantity of stakes (dynamic security). We argue that quality comes at the cost of quantity, identifying a trade-off between the two strategies when designing POS systems. We test our qualitative findings using panel analysis on collected data. The analysis indicates that enhancing the quality of the validator set through security measures like slashing and minimum staking amounts may decrease dynamic security. Further, the analysis reveals a strategic divergence among blockchains, highlighting the absence of a single, universally optimal staking design solution. The optimal design hinges upon a platform's specific objectives and its developmental stage. This research compels blockchain developers to meticulously assess the trade-offs outlined in this paper when developing their staking designs. |

This paper explores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in bolstering blockchain-enabled IoT systems, potentially marking a significant leap forward in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality across networks. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable ledger, ideal for the secure management of device identities and transactions in IoT networks. When coupled with AI, these systems gain the ability to not only automate and optimize security protocols but also adaptively respond to new and evolving cyber threats. This dual capability enhances the resilience of networks against cyber-attacks, a critical consideration as IoT devices increasingly permeate critical infrastructures. The synergy between AI and blockchain in IoT is profound. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from IoT devices to detect patterns and anomalies that may signify security breaches. Concurrently, blockchain can ensure that data records are tamper-proof, enhancing the reliability of AI-driven security measures. Moreover, this research evaluates the implications of AI-enhanced blockchain systems on privacy protection within IoT networks. IoT devices often collect sensitive personal data, making privacy a paramount concern. AI can facilitate the development of new protocols that ensure data privacy and user anonymity without compromising the functionality of IoT systems. Through comprehensive analysis and case studies, this paper aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how AI-enhanced blockchain technology can revolutionize network security and privacy in IoT environments. |

The proposed model introduces a dual NFT architecture: Membership NFTs (\(NFT_{auth}\)) for authentication and access control, and Interaction NFTs (\(NFT_{priv}\)) for enabling private, encrypted interactions among participants. Governance is enforced through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, such as conditional identity disclosure. By prioritizing privacy, security, and deterrence over financial rewards, this model addresses key challenges in existing blockchain incentive structures, paving the way for more sustainable and decentralized governance frameworks. |

These projects, including zero-knowledge rollups, rely on highly hand-optimized circuits whose correctness comes at the cost of time-consuming testing and auditing.   In this paper, we present Clap, the first Rust eDSL with a proof system agnostic circuit format, facilitating extensibility, automatic optimizations, and formal assurances for the resultant constraint system. Clap casts the problem of producing Plonkish constraint systems and their witness generators as a semantic-preserving compilation problem. Soundness and completeness of the transformation guarantees the absence of subtle bugs caused by under- or over-constraining. Our experimental evaluation shows that its automatic optimizations achieve better performance compared to manual circuit optimization. The optimizer can also be used to automatically derive custom gates from circuit descriptions. |

BDM is built on models and frameworks refined by key identification factors, data analysis, and mathematical or computational aspects applicable to complex business scenarios. Gaining actionable intelligence from collected data for BDM requires a carefully considered infrastructure to ensure data transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability. Organisations should consider social, economic and environmental factors (based on the triple bottom line approach) to ensure sustainability when integrating such an infrastructure. These sustainability features directly impact BDM concerning resource optimisation, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance and environmental impacts. To further understand these segments, taxonomies are defined to evaluate blockchain and DT sustainability features based on an in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art research. Detailed comparative evaluations provide insight into the reachability of the sustainable solution in terms of ideologies, access control and performance overheads. Several research questions are put forward to motivate further research that significantly impacts BDM. Finally, a case study based on an exemplary supply chain management system is presented to show the interoperability of blockchain and DT with BDM. |

The framework addresses the challenge of leveraging health data for analytics while protecting patient privacy. To achieve this, the study integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Federated Learning (FL) to protect sensitive health data collected by IoT nodes. The proposed framework utilizes dynamic personalization and adaptive noise distribution strategies to balance privacy and data utility. Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent aggregation and storage of model updates. Experimental results on the SVHN dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves strong privacy guarantees against various attack scenarios while maintaining high accuracy in health analytics tasks. For 15 rounds of federated learning with an epsilon value of 8.0, the model obtains an accuracy of 64.50%. The blockchain integration, utilizing Ethereum, Ganache, Web3.py, and IPFS, exhibits an average transaction latency of around 6 seconds and consistent gas consumption across rounds, validating the practicality and feasibility of the proposed approach. |

Attacks on DeFi have been frequent and have resulted in losses exceeding \$77 billion. However, detection methods for malicious DeFi events are still lacking. In this paper, we propose DeFiTail, the first framework that utilizes deep learning to detect access control and flash loan exploits that may occur on DeFi. Since the DeFi protocol events involve invocations with multi-account transactions, which requires execution path unification with different contracts. Moreover, to mitigate the impact of mistakes in Control Flow Graph (CFG) connections, we validate the data path by employing the symbolic execution stack. Furthermore, we feed the data paths through our model to achieve the inspection of DeFi protocols. Experimental results indicate that DeFiTail achieves the highest accuracy, with 98.39% in access control and 97.43% in flash loan exploits. DeFiTail also demonstrates an enhanced capability to detect malicious contracts, identifying 86.67% accuracy from the CVE dataset. |

Every cryptocurrency must have an associated Blockchain. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies, this may be considered as the most promising disruptive technology in the industry 4.0 context. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based financial infrastructure, the term generally refers to an open, permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. It replicates existing financial services in a more open and transparent way. DeFi does not rely on intermediaries and centralized institutions. Instead, it is based on open protocols and decentralized applications (Dapps). Considering that there are many digital coins, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these currencies should interact among each other sometime. For this interaction the Information Technology elements play an important whole as enablers and IT strategic alignment. This paper considers the strategic alignment model proposed by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) and Luftman (1996). This paper seeks to answer two main questions 1) What are the common IT elements in the DeFi? And 2) How the elements connect to the IT strategic alignment in DeFi? Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Results point out that there are many IT elements already mentioned by literature, however there is a lack in the literature about the connection between IT elements and IT strategic alignment in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) architectural network. After final considerations, limitations and future research agenda are presented. Keywords: IT Strategic alignment, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Cryptocurrency, Digital Economy. |
|**2024-09-16**|**Give and Take: An End-To-End Investigation of Giveaway Scam Conversion Rates**|Enze Liu et.al.|[2405.09757](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09757)| Scams -- fraudulent schemes designed to swindle money from victims -- have existed for as long as recorded history. However, the Internet's combination of low communication cost, global reach, and functional anonymity has allowed scam volumes to reach new heights. Designing effective interventions requires first understanding the context: how scammers reach potential victims, the earnings they make, and any potential bottlenecks for durable interventions. In this short paper, we focus on these questions in the context of cryptocurrency giveaway scams, where victims are tricked into irreversibly transferring funds to scammers under the pretense of even greater returns. Combining data from Twitter, YouTube and Twitch livestreams, landing pages, and cryptocurrency blockchains, we measure how giveaway scams operate at scale. We find that 1 in 1000 scam tweets, and 4 in 100,000 livestream views, net a victim, and that scammers managed to extract nearly \$4.62 million from just hundreds of victims during our measurement window. |

To avoid the limitation of serially adding one block at a time to a blockchain, multiple semi-independent chains are used such that several valid blocks can be added in parallel, when they are added to separate chains. Blocks are added to different chains, the chain index being determined by a ``ticket'' that the miner must produce before creating a new block. This allows increasing the transaction rate by several orders of magnitude while the system is still fully decentralized and permissionless, and maintaining security in the sense that a successful attack would require the attacker to control a significant portion of the whole network. |
|**2024-05-15**|**Flashback: Enhancing Proposer-Builder Design with Future-Block Auctions in Proof-of-Stake Ethereum**|Yifan Mao et.al.|[2405.09465](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09465)| Maximal extractable value (MEV) in which block proposers unethically gain profits by manipulating the order in which transactions are included within a block, is a key challenge facing blockchains such as Ethereum today. Left unchecked, MEV can lead to a centralization of stake distribution thereby ultimately compromising the security of blockchain consensus. To preserve proposer decentralization (and hence security) of the blockchain, Ethereum has advocated for a proposer-builder separation (PBS) in which the functionality of transaction ordering is separated from proposers and assigned to separate entities called builders. Builders accept transaction bundles from searchers, who compete to find the most profitable bundles. Builders then bid completed blocks to proposers, who accept the most profitable blocks for publication. The auction mechanisms used between searchers, builders and proposers are crucial to the overall health of the blockchain. In this paper, we consider PBS design in Ethereum as a game between searchers, builders and proposers. A key novelty in our design is the inclusion of future block proposers, as all proposers of an epoch are decided ahead of time in proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum within the game model. Our analysis shows the existence of alternative auction mechanisms that result in a better (more profitable) equilibrium to players compared to state-of-the-art. Experimental evaluations based on synthetic and real-world data traces corroborate the analysis. Our results highlight that a rethinking of auction mechanism designs is necessary in PoS Ethereum to prevent disruption. |

However, the DEX project with multi-contract interaction is accompanied by complex state logic, which makes it challenging to solve state defects. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on state derailment defects of DEXs. These defects could lead to incorrect, incomplete, or unauthorized changes to the system state during contract execution, potentially causing security threats. We propose StateGuard, a deep learning-based framework to detect state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. StateGuard constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the smart contract, extracting key features to generate a graph representation. Then, it leverages a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to discover defects. Evaluating StateGuard on 46 DEX projects with 5,671 smart contracts reveals its effectiveness, with a precision of 92.24%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuard to audit real-world smart contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs. |
|**2024-05-15**|**Temporarily Restricting Solidity Smart Contract Interactions**|Valerian Callens et.al.|[2405.09084](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09084)| In this work we explore ways to restrict the ability to call Solidity smart contract functions for a specified duration. We describe methods to restrict functions from being called twice in the same transaction, block, or time period. This is related to the notion of non-reentrant functions, which are functions that can be called within a previous execution. These methods can be used to restrict interactions with entire sets of functions of smart contracts. We are motivated to revisit this topic for two reasons. First, we note that sixteen real-world smart contracts exploits in 2023 resulting in over $136M USD lost or stolen that could have been prevented by restricting function calls. As part of this survey, we dissect a new class of exploit that involves so-called read-only reentrancy: exploits that re-enter read-only functions to make smart contract state inconsistent in order to enable their exploitation. Second, while some of these approaches are simple, they may not always behave the same across different blockchains that support Solidity. |

We further discuss our motivation, implementation, design decisions, limitations, and preliminary results. Overall, this paper is intended to serve as an initial introduction to building such system(s) on top of the Solana L1 blockchain, but does not represent an absolute. Lastly, we comment discuss on extensions of this specification to support SVM rollups on other well-established L1 blockchains systems such as Ethereum. |

The proposed network is structured into a primary layer, consisting of Road Side Units and edge servers as servers of Blockchain-enabled Domain Name Services for managing inter-vehicle communications identities, and a sub-layer within each vehicle for intra-vehicle communications via the Blockchain-enabled Mutual Authentication Protocol. This design facilitates secure connections across vehicles by coordinating between the layers, significantly improving communications security and efficiency. This study also evaluates Road Side Unit availability against the random distribution of Road Side Units along the route of different vehicles. The proposed model presents a novel pathway towards a decentralised, secure, and efficient Internet of Vehicles ecosystem, contributing to the advancement of autonomous and trustworthy vehicular networks. |

This deployment, called the Industrial Metaverse, is used for product design, production operations, industrial quality inspection, and product testing. However, there lacks of in-depth understanding of the enabling technologies associated with the Industrial Metaverse. This encompasses both the precise industrial scenarios targeted by each technology and the potential migration of technologies developed in other domains to the industrial sector. Driven by this issue, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on the Industrial Metaverse. Specifically, we first analyze the advantages of the Metaverse for industrial production. Then, we review a collection of key enabling technologies of the Industrial Metaverse, including blockchain (BC), digital twin (DT), 6G, XR, and artificial intelligence (AI), and analyze how these technologies can support different aspects of industrial production. Subsequently, we present numerous formidable challenges encountered within the Industrial Metaverse, including confidentiality and security concerns, resource limitations, and interoperability constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the extant solutions devised to address them. Finally, we briefly outline several open issues and future research directions of the Industrial Metaverse. |
|**2024-05-14**|**Cross-Blockchain Communication Using Oracles With an Off-Chain Aggregation Mechanism Based on zk-SNARKs**|Michael Sober et.al.|[2405.08395](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08395)| The closed architecture of prevailing blockchain systems renders the usage of this technology mostly infeasible for a wide range of real-world problems. Most blockchains trap users and applications in their isolated space without the possibility of cooperating or switching to other blockchains. Therefore, blockchains need additional mechanisms for seamless communication and arbitrary data exchange between each other and external systems. Unfortunately, current approaches for cross-blockchain communication are resource-intensive or require additional blockchains or tailored solutions depending on the applied consensus mechanisms of the connected blockchains. Therefore, we propose an oracle with an off-chain aggregation mechanism based on ZeroKnowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to facilitate cross-blockchain communication. The oracle queries data from another blockchain and applies a rollup-like mechanism to move state and computation off-chain. The zkOracle contract only expects the transferred data, an updated state root, and proof of the correct execution of the aggregation mechanism. The proposed solution only requires constant 378 kgas to submit data on the Ethereum blockchain and is primarily independent of the underlying technology of the queried blockchains. |
|**2024-05-14**|**Foundational Verification of Smart Contracts through Verified Compilation**|Vilhelm Sjöberg et.al.|[2405.08348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08348)| Programs executed on a blockchain - smart contracts - have high financial stakes; their correctness is crucial. We argue, that this correctness needs to be foundational: correctness needs to be based on the operational semantics of their execution environment. In this work we present a foundational system - the DeepSEA system - targeting the Ethereum blockchain as the largest smart contract platform. The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding. |
|**2024-07-02**|**Facilitating Feature and Topology Lightweighting: An Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression Method for Malicious Account Detection**|Jiajun Zhou et.al.|[2405.08278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08278)| Ethereum has become one of the primary global platforms for cryptocurrency, playing an important role in promoting the diversification of the financial ecosystem. However, the relative lag in regulation has led to a proliferation of malicious activities in Ethereum, posing a serious threat to fund security. Existing regulatory methods usually detect malicious accounts through feature engineering or large-scale transaction graph mining. However, due to the immense scale of transaction data and malicious attacks, these methods suffer from inefficiency and low robustness during data processing and anomaly detection. In this regard, we propose an Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression method named TGC4Eth, which assists malicious account detection by lightweighting both features and topology of the transaction graph. At the feature level, we select transaction features based on their low importance to improve the robustness of the subsequent detection models against feature evasion attacks; at the topology level, we employ focusing and coarsening processes to compress the structure of the transaction graph, thereby improving both data processing and inference efficiency of detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGC4Eth significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing detection models while preserving the connectivity of the transaction graph. Furthermore, TGC4Eth enables existing detection models to maintain stable performance and exhibit high robustness against feature evasion attacks. |
|**2024-05-14**|**T-Watch: Towards Timed Execution of Private Transaction in Blockchains**|Chao Li et.al.|[2405.08268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08268)| In blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, transactions represent the primary mechanism that the external world can use to trigger a change of blockchain state. Transactions serve as key sources of evidence and play a vital role in forensic analysis. Timed transaction refers to a specific class of service that enables a user to schedule a transaction to change the blockchain state during a chosen future time-frame. This paper proposes T-Watch, a decentralized and cost-efficient approach for users to schedule timed execution of any type of transaction in Ethereum with privacy guarantees. T-Watch employs a novel combination of threshold secret sharing and decentralized smart contracts. To protect the private elements of a scheduled transaction from getting disclosed before the future time-frame, T-Watch maintains shares of the decryption key of the scheduled transaction using a group of executors recruited in a blockchain network before the specified future time-frame and restores the scheduled transaction at a proxy smart contract to trigger the change of blockchain state at the required time-frame. To reduce the cost of smart contract execution in T-Watch, we carefully design the proposed protocol to run in an optimistic mode by default and then switch to a pessimistic mode once misbehaviors occur. Furthermore, the protocol supports users to form service request pooling to further reduce the gas cost. We rigorously analyze the security of T-Watch and implement the protocol over the Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that T-Watch is more scalable compared to the state of the art and could reduce the cost by over 90% through pooling. |
|**2024-10-29**|**Optimal Multilevel Slashing for Blockchains**|Kenan Wood et.al.|[2405.08135](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08135)| We present the notion of multilevel slashing, where proof-of-stake blockchain validators can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain block is bound to be finalized in a global consensus procedure, unless an increasing and optimally large number of Byzantine processes have their staked assets slashed -- that is, deducted -- due to provably incorrect behavior. Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of combinatorial intersection systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. Even under weak conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and validator load; this result also illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. In addition, we show that any intersection system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "committees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under similarly weak conditions. Finally, our multilevel construction gives the flexibility to blockchain validators to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain. This functionality can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based block finalization; or (ii) a service to support reorg tolerance. |
|**2024-05-13**|**Efficient and Universal Merkle Tree Inclusion Proofs via OR Aggregation**|Oleksandr Kuznetsov et.al.|[2405.07941](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07941)| Zero-knowledge proofs have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing privacy and security in blockchain applications. However, the efficiency and scalability of proof systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in the context of Merkle tree inclusion proofs. Traditional proof aggregation techniques based on AND logic suffer from high verification complexity and data communication overhead, limiting their practicality for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a novel proof aggregation approach based on OR logic, which enables the generation of compact and universally verifiable proofs for Merkle tree inclusion. By aggregating proofs using OR logic, we achieve a proof size that is independent of the number of leaves in the tree, and verification can be performed using any single valid leaf hash. This represents a significant improvement over AND aggregation, which requires the verifier to process all leaf hashes. We formally define the OR aggregation logic, describe the process of generating universal proofs, and provide a comparative analysis demonstrating the advantages of our approach in terms of proof size, verification data, and universality. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of combining OR and AND aggregation logics to create complex acceptance functions, enabling the development of expressive and efficient proof systems for various blockchain applications. The proposed techniques have the potential to significantly enhance the scalability, efficiency, and flexibility of zero-knowledge proof systems, paving the way for more practical and adaptive solutions in the blockchain ecosystem. |

Nevertheless, data security in IoT edge computing still faces critical threats (e.g., data breaches). Access control is fundamental for mitigating these threats. However, IoT edge computing introduces notable challenges for achieving resource-conserving, low-latency, flexible, and scalable access control. To review recent access control measures, we novelly organize them according to different data lifecycles--data collection, storage, and usage--and, meanwhile, review blockchain technology in this novel organization. In this way, we provide novel insights and envisage several potential research directions. This survey can help readers find gaps systematically and prompt the development of access control techniques in IoT edge computing under the intricacy of innovations in access control. |
|**2024-05-13**|**Towards Rational Consensus in Honest Majority**|Varul Srivastava et.al.|[2405.07557](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07557)| Distributed consensus protocols reach agreement among $n$ players in the presence of $f$ adversaries; different protocols support different values of $f$. Existing works study this problem for different adversary types (captured by threat models). There are three primary threat models: (i) Crash fault tolerance (CFT), (ii) Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and (iii) Rational fault tolerance (RFT), each more general than the previous. Agreement in repeated rounds on both (1) the proposed value in each round and (2) the ordering among agreed-upon values across multiple rounds is called Atomic BroadCast (ABC). ABC is more generalized than consensus and is employed in blockchains.   This work studies ABC under the RFT threat model. We consider $t$ byzantine and $k$ rational adversaries among $n$ players. We also study different types of rational players based on their utility towards (1) liveness attack, (2) censorship or (3) disagreement (forking attack). We study the problem of ABC under this general threat model in partially-synchronous networks. We show (1) ABC is impossible for $n/3< (t+k) <n/2$ if rational players prefer liveness or censorship attacks and (2) the consensus protocol proposed by Ranchal-Pedrosa and Gramoli cannot be generalized to solve ABC due to insecure Nash equilibrium (resulting in disagreement). For ABC in partially synchronous network settings, we propose a novel protocol \textsf{pRFT}(practical Rational Fault Tolerance). We show \textsf{pRFT} achieves ABC if (a) rational players prefer only disagreement attacks and (b) $t < \frac{n}{4}$ and $(t + k) < \frac{n}{2}$ . In \textsf{pRFT}, we incorporate accountability (capturing deviating players) within the protocol by leveraging honest players. We also show that the message complexity of \textsf{pRFT} is at par with the best consensus protocols that guarantee accountability. |

A blockchain-based public key infrastructure allows the usage of public key cryptography and public key based authentication protocols. The blockchain provides a common storage of the public keys and their relations and can provide the required information for the authentication process. Furthermore, the unmanned aerial vehicles store selected parts of the blockchain in order to operate independently in areas where they might not have access to the Internet. This allows unmanned aerial vehicles to authenticate entities of the network, like other unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud services, cars, and any computer. |

As synthetic data proliferates, the need for a robust evaluation framework to select a synthetic data generator becomes more pressing given the variety of options available. In this research study, we investigate two primary questions: 1) How can we select the most suitable synthetic data generator from a set of options for a specific purpose? 2) How can we make the selection process more transparent, accountable, and auditable? To address these questions, we introduce a novel approach in which the proposed ranking algorithm is implemented as a smart contract within a permissioned blockchain framework called Sawtooth. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art baseline ranking solutions, our framework demonstrates its effectiveness in providing nuanced rankings that consider both desirable and undesirable properties. Furthermore, our framework serves as a valuable tool for selecting the optimal synthetic data generators for specific needs while ensuring compliance with data protection principles. |

Our algorithm takes a new approach of selecting validator shards for each transaction from those that previously held the assets being transferred. This approach ensures the algorithm's robustness and efficiency. TRAIL is presented using PBFT for internal shard transaction processing and a modified version of PBFT for external cross-shard validation. We describe TRAIL, prove it correct, analyze its message complexity, and evaluate its performance. We propose various TRAIL optimizations: we describe how it can be adapted to other Byzantine-tolerant consensus algorithms, how a complete system may be built on the basis of it, and how TRAIL can be applied to existing and future sharded blockchains. |
|**2024-05-11**|**Unveiling the Era of Spatial Computing**|Hanzhong Cao et.al.|[2405.06895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06895)| The evolution of User Interfaces marks a significant transition from traditional command-line interfaces to more intuitive graphical and touch-based interfaces, largely driven by the emergence of personal computing devices. The advent of spatial computing and Extended Reality technologies further pushes the boundaries, promising a fusion of physical and digital realms through interactive environments. This paper delves into the progression from All Realities technologies encompassing Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mediated Reality to spatial computing, highlighting their conceptual differences and applications. We explore enabling technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and blockchain that underpin the development of spatial computing. We further scrutinize the initial forays into commercial spatial computing devices, with a focus on Apple's Vision Pro, evaluating its technological advancements alongside the challenges it faces. Through this examination, we aim to provide insights into the potential of spatial computing to revolutionize our interaction with digital information and the physical world. |
|**2024-08-16**|**Implementation Study of Cost-Effective Verification for Pietrzak's Verifiable Delay Function in Ethereum Smart Contracts**|Suhyeon Lee et.al.|[2405.06498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06498)| Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a cryptographic concept that ensures a minimum delay before output through sequential processing, which is resistant to parallel computing. One of the significant VDF protocols academically reviewed is the VDF protocol proposed by Pietrzak. However, for the blockchain environment, the Pietrzak VDF has drawbacks including long poof size and recursive protocol computation. In this paper, we present an implementation study of Pietrzak VDF verification on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We found that the discussion in the Pietrzak's original paper can help a clear optimization in EVM where the costs of computation are predefined as the specific amounts of gas. In our results, the cost of VDF verification can be reduced from 4M to 2M gas, and the proof length can be generated under 8 KB with the 2048-bit RSA key length, which is much smaller than the previous expectation. |
|**2024-05-09**|**Deferred Objects to Enhance Smart Contract Programming with Optimistic Parallel Execution**|George Mitenkov et.al.|[2405.06117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06117)| One of the main bottlenecks of blockchains is smart contract execution. To increase throughput, modern blockchains try to execute transactions in parallel. Unfortunately, however, common blockchain use cases introduce read-write conflicts between transactions, forcing sequentiality.   We propose RapidLane, an extension for parallel execution engines that allows the engine to capture computations in conflicting parts of transactions and defer their execution until a later time, sometimes optimistically predicting execution results. This technique, coupled with support for a new construct for smart contract languages, allows one to turn certain sequential workloads into parallelizable ones.   We integrated RapidLane into Block-STM, a state-of-the-art parallel execution engine used by several blockchains in production, and deployed it on the Aptos blockchain. Our evaluation shows that on commonly contended workloads, such as peer-to-peer transfers with a single fee payer and NFT minting, RapidLane yields up to $12\times$ more throughput. |

A political look at the blockchain vision**|Rainer Rehak et.al.|[2405.06097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06097)| A lot of business and research effort currently deals with the so called decentralised ledger technology blockchain. Putting it to use carries the tempting promise to make the intermediaries of social interactions superfluous and furthermore keep secure track of all interactions. Currently intermediaries such as banks and notaries are necessary and must be trusted, which creates great dependencies, as the financial crisis of 2008 painfully demonstrated. Especially banks and notaries are said to become dispensable as a result of using the blockchain. But in real-world applications of the blockchain, the power of central actors does not dissolve, it only shifts to new, democratically illegitimate, uncontrolled or even uncontrollable power centers. As interesting as the blockchain technically is, it doesn't efficiently solve any real-world problem and is no substitute for traditional political processes or democratic regulation of power. Research efforts investigating the blockchain should be halted. |

The increasing demand for high-performance and scalable blockchain protocols has brought attention to solving consensus in scenarios where each participant joins the system knowing only a subset of participants. In such scenarios, the participants' initial knowledge about the existence of other participants can collectively be represented by a directed graph known as knowledge connectivity graph. The Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus with Unknown Participants (BFT-CUP) problem aims to solve consensus in those scenarios by identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions that the knowledge connectivity graphs must satisfy when a fault threshold is provided to all participants. This work extends BFT-CUP by eliminating the requirement to provide the fault threshold to the participants. We indeed address the problem of solving BFT consensus in settings where each participant initially knows a subset of participants, and although a fault threshold exists, no participant is provided with this information -- referred to as BFT Consensus with Unknown Participants and Fault Threshold (BFT-CUPFT). With this aim, we first demonstrate that the conditions for knowledge connectivity graphs identified by BFT-CUP are insufficient to solve BFT-CUPFT. Accordingly, we introduce a new type of knowledge connectivity graphs by determining the necessary and sufficient conditions they must satisfy to solve BFT-CUPFT. Furthermore, we design a protocol for solving BFT-CUPFT. |

Sharding, which divides the chain into smaller segments, called shards, offers a solution by enabling parallel transaction processing. However, sharding introduces new complexities, notably how to allocate nodes to shards without compromising the network's security.   This paper introduces a novel linear optimization framework for node allocation to shards that addresses decentralization constraints while minimizing resource consumption. In contrast to traditional methods that depend on random or trust-based assignments, our approach evaluates node characteristics, including ownership, hardware, and geographical distribution, and requires an explicit specification of decentralization targets with respect to these characteristics. By employing linear optimization, the framework identifies a resource-efficient node set meeting these targets. Adopted by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) community, this framework proves its utility in real-world blockchain applications. It provides a quantitative tool for node onboarding and offboarding decisions, balancing decentralization and resource considerations. |

This study explores the potential of blockchain in enhancing data integrity and traceability within Industry Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), a crucial aspect in the era of Industry 4.0. ICPS, integrating computational and physical components, is pivotal in managing critical infrastructure like manufacturing, power grids, and transportation networks. However, they face challenges in security, privacy, and reliability. With its inherent immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, blockchain presents a groundbreaking approach to address these challenges. It ensures robust data reliability and traceability across ICPS, enhancing transaction transparency and facilitating secure data sharing. This research unearths various blockchain applications in ICPS, including supply chain management, quality control, contract management, and data sharing. Each application demonstrates blockchain's capacity to streamline processes, reduce fraud, and enhance system efficiency. In supply chain management, blockchain provides real-time auditing and compliance. For quality control, it establishes tamper-proof records, boosting consumer confidence. In contract management, smart contracts automate execution, enhancing efficiency. Blockchain also fosters secure collaboration in ICPS, which is crucial for system stability and safety. This study emphasizes the need for further research on blockchain's practical implementation in ICPS, focusing on challenges like scalability, system integration, and security vulnerabilities. It also suggests examining blockchain's economic and organizational impacts in ICPS to understand its feasibility and long-term advantages. |

Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing. However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns. For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data. This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications. We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs. Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains. Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT. Ultimately, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the synergies between blockchains and the IoT ecosystem, highlighting the opportunities and complexities involved. |

Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results. |

To this end, we propose a novel selfish mining attack that aims to maximize this objective and formally model the attack as a Markov decision process (MDP). We then present a formal analysis procedure which computes an $\epsilon$-tight lower bound on the optimal expected relative revenue in the MDP and a strategy that achieves this $\epsilon$-tight lower bound, where $\epsilon>0$ may be any specified precision. Our analysis is fully automated and provides formal guarantees on the correctness. We evaluate our selfish mining attack and observe that it achieves superior expected relative revenue compared to two considered baselines.   In concurrent work [Sarenche FC'24] does an automated analysis on selfish mining in predictable longest-chain blockchains based on efficient proof systems. Predictable means the randomness for the challenges is fixed for many blocks (as used e.g., in Ouroboros), while we consider unpredictable (Bitcoin-like) chains where the challenge is derived from the previous block. |

However, this expansion accompanies security challenges, making these wallets prime targets for malicious activities. Despite a substantial user base, there is not only a significant gap in comprehensive security analysis but also a pressing need for specialized tools that can aid developers in reducing vulnerabilities during the development process. To fill the void, we present a comprehensive security analysis of browser-based wallets in this paper, along with the development of an automated tool designed for this purpose. We first compile a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities resident in cryptocurrency wallets by harvesting historical security reports. Based on this, we design WALLETRADAR, an automated detection framework that can accurately identify security issues based on static and dynamic analysis. Evaluation of 96 popular browser-based wallets shows WALLETRADAR's effectiveness, by successfully automating the detection process in 90% of these wallets with high precision. This evaluation has led to the discovery of 116 security vulnerabilities corresponding to 70 wallets. By the time of this paper, we have received confirmations of 10 vulnerabilities from 8 wallet developers, with over $2,000 bug bounties. Further, we observed that 12 wallet developers have silently fixed 16 vulnerabilities after our disclosure. WALLETRADAR can effectively automate the identification of security risks in cryptocurrency wallets, thereby enhancing software development quality and safety in the blockchain ecosystem. |

However, DNN model trading may trigger concerns of the unauthorized replications or misuses over the model, so that the benefit of the model ownership will be violated. Model identity auditing is a challenging issue in protecting intellectual property of DNN models and verifying the integrity and ownership of models for guaranteeing trusts in transactions is one of the critical obstacles. In this paper, we focus on the above issue and propose a novel Accumulator-enabled Auditing for Distributed Identity of DNN Model (A2-DIDM) that utilizes blockchain and zero-knowledge techniques to protect data and function privacy while ensuring the lightweight on-chain ownership verification. The proposed model presents a scheme of identity records via configuring model weight checkpoints with corresponding zero-knowledge proofs, which incorporates predicates to capture incremental state changes in model weight checkpoints. Our scheme ensures both computational integrity of DNN training process and programmability, so that the uniqueness of the weight checkpoint sequence in a DNN model is preserved, ensuring the correctness of the model identity auditing. In addition, A2-DIDM also addresses privacy protections in distributed identity via a proposed method of accumulators. We systematically analyze the security and robustness of our proposed model and further evaluate the effectiveness and usability of auditing DNN model identities. |

Current blockchain-based CT approaches require off-chain negotiation of critical information and often overlook the dynamic session keys updating, which increases the risk of message and key leakage. Additionally, in some approaches the covert transactions exhibit obvious characteristics that can be easily detected by third-parties. Moreover, most approaches do not address the issue of decreased reliability of message transmission in blockchain attack scenarios. Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based approaches also have the issue of transaction linkability, which can be tackled by Monero-based approaches because of the privacy protection mechanisms in Monero. However, Monero-based CT has the problem of sender repudiation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monero-Based CT approach (MBCT), which enables on-chain session key dynamically updating without off-chain negotiation. MBCT can assure non-repudiation of transmission participants, confidentiality of keys, reliability of message transmission and less observable characteristics. There are achieved by the three components in MBCT, namely, a sender authentication method, a dynamically on-chain session key updating method and a state feedback method. We implement MBCT in Monero-0.18.1.0 and the experiment results demonstrate its high embedding capacity of MBCT. |

Blockchain is a robust distributed ledger that uses consensus algorithms to approve transactions in a decentralized manner, making malicious tampering extremely difficult. Ethereum, one of the blockchains, can be seen as an unstoppable computer which shared by users around the world that can run Turing-complete programs. In order to run any program on Ethereum, Ether (currency on Ethereum) is required. In other words, Ether can be seen as a kind of energy in the Ethereum world. We developed self-replicating and self-employed agents who earn the energy by themselves to replicate them, on the Ethereum blockchain. The agents can issued their token and gain Ether each time the tokens are sold. When a certain amount of Ether is accumulated, the agent replicates itself and leaves offspring. The goal of this project is to implement artificial agents that lives for itself, not as a tool for humans, in the open cyber space connected to the real world. |

However, there are still many security issues in FL that deserve discussion. In this paper, we consider three major issues: 1) how to ensure that the training process can be publicly audited by any third party; 2) how to avoid the influence of malicious participants on training; 3) how to ensure that private gradients and models are not leaked to third parties. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, while solving the above three problems simultaneously is seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a publicly auditable and privacy-preserving federated learning scheme that is resistant to malicious participants uploading gradients with wrong directions and enables anyone to audit and verify the correctness of the training process. In particular, we design a robust aggregation algorithm capable of detecting gradients with wrong directions from malicious participants. Then, we design a random vector generation algorithm and combine it with zero sharing and blockchain technologies to make the joint training process publicly auditable, meaning anyone can verify the correctness of the training. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments, and the experimental results show that the model generated by the protocol is comparable in accuracy to the original FL approach while keeping security advantages. |

This paper focuses on developing a performance guarantee for the distributed estimation in a BIoT in the presence of malicious attacks which jointly exploits vulnerabilities present in both IoT devices and the employed blockchain within the BIoT. To achieve this, we adopt the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as the performance metric, and maximize the CRB for estimating the parameter of interest over the attack domain. However, the maximization problem is inherently non-convex, making it infeasible to obtain the globally optimal solution in general. To address this issue, we develop a relaxation method capable of transforming the original non-convex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we derive the analytical expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed optimization problem. The optimal value of the relaxed optimization problem can be used to provide a valid estimation performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks. |

A significant challenge in P2P content delivery remains: the fair compensation of relayers for their bandwidth contributions. Existing solutions employ blockchains for payment settlements, however, they are not practical due to high on-chain costs and over-simplified network assumptions. In this paper, we introduce FairRelay, a fair and cost-efficient protocol that ensures all participants get fair payoff in complex content delivery network settings. We introduce a novel primitive, Enforceable Accumulative Hashed TimeLock Contract (Enforceable A-HTLC), designed to guarantee payment atomicity - ensuring all participants receive their payments upon successful content delivery.   The fairness of FairRelay is proved using the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Our evaluation demonstrates that, in optimistic scenarios, FairRelay employs zero on-chain costs. In pessimistic scenarios, the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are constant, irrespective of the network complexity. Specifically, empirical results indicate that the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are 24,902 gas (equivalent to 0.01 USD on Optimism L2) and 290,797 gas (0.07 USD), respectively. In a 10-hop relay path, FairRelay introduces less than 1.5% additional overhead compared to pure data transmission, showcasing the efficiency of FairRelay. |

TetraBFT has several compelling features: it necessitates only constant local storage, has optimal communication complexity, satisfies optimistic responsiveness -- allowing the protocol to operate at actual network speeds under ideal conditions -- and can achieve consensus in just 5 message delays, which outperforms all known unauthenticated protocols achieving the other properties listed. We validate the correctness of TetraBFT through rigorous security analysis and formal verification. Furthermore, we extend TetraBFT into a multi-shot, chained consensus protocol, making a pioneering effort in applying pipelining techniques to unauthenticated protocols. This positions TetraBFT as a practical and deployable solution for blockchain systems aiming for high efficiency. |

Our analysis includes a detailed review of price trends, volatility, and correlations within the cryptocurrency market, focusing on major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. We provide a critical assessment of the impact of significant market events, such as the FTX bankruptcy, highlighting the vulnerabilities and resilience of the crypto market. The study also explores the potential of blockchain technology to innovate real estate transactions by enabling the secure and transparent handling of property deeds without traditional intermediaries. We introduce a blockchain protocol that reduces transaction costs, enhances security, and increases transparency, making real estate transactions more accessible and efficient.

BFT-based consensus mechanisms are widely adopted in the permissioned blockchain to meet the high scalability requirements of the network. Sybil attacks are one of the most potential threats when applying BFT-based consensus mechanisms in permissionless blockchain due to the lack of effective verification mechanisms for participants' identities. This paper presents a novel endorsement-based bootstrapping protocol with a signature algorithm that offers a streamlined, scalable identity endorsement and verification process. This approach effectively safeguards the BFT-based consensus mechanism against Sybil attacks. Using our proposed method, we have conducted thorough security analyses and simulation experiments to assess security, robustness, and scalability advantages in large-scale networks. Our results demonstrate that the scheme can effectively address the identity verification challenges when applying BFT-based consensus in a permissionless blockchain. |

Specifically, we illustrate how: 1) fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds; 2) performance fees can be charged like hedge funds; 3) mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes, such as high water marks; and 4) measures to offset trading related slippage costs when redemptions happen. Using our concepts - and blockchain technology - traditional funds can calculate performance fees in a simplified manner and alleviate several operational issues. Blockchain can solve many problems for traditional finance, while tried and tested wealth management techniques can benefit decentralization, speeding its adoption. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas and discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks, making smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to our mechanisms. |
|**2024-05-03**|**Tokenization of Real Estate Assets Using Blockchain**|Shashank Joshi et.al.|[2405.01852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01852)| Blockchain technology is one of the key technologies that have revolutionized various facets of society, such as the banking, healthcare, and other critical ecosystems. One area that can harness the usage of blockchain is the real estate sector. The most lucrative long-term investment is real estate, followed by gold, equities, mutual funds, and savings accounts. Nevertheless, it has administrative overheads such as lack of transparency, fraud, several intermediaries, title issues, paperwork, an increasing number of arbitrations, and the lack of liquidity. This paper proposes a framework that uses blockchain as an underlying technology. With the aid of blockchain and the suite of tools, it supports many of these problems that can be alleviated in the real estate investment ecosystem. These include smart contracts, immutable record management, tokenization, record tracking, and time-stamped storage. Tokenization of real estate lowers the entry barrier by fixing liquidity and interoperability and improving the interaction between various stakeholders. |
|**2024-05-03**|**Sequencer Level Security**|Martin Derka et.al.|[2405.01819](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01819)| Current blockchains do not provide any security guarantees to the smart contracts and their users as far as the content of the transactions is concerned. In the spirit of decentralization and censorship resistance, they follow the paradigm of including valid transactions in blocks without any further scrutiny. Rollups are a special kind of blockchains whose primary purpose is to scale the transaction throughput. Many of the existing rollups operate through a centrally operated sequencing protocol. In this paper, we introduce the Sequencer Level Security (SLS) protocol, an enhancement to sequencing protocols of rollups. This pioneering contribution explores the concept of the sequencer's capability to identify and temporarily quarantine malicious transactions instead of including them in blocks immediately. We describe the mechanics of the protocol for both the transactions submitted to the rollup mempool, as well as transactions originating from Layer one. We comment on topics such as trust and decentralization, and consider the security impact on the protocol itself. We implement a prototype of the SLS protocol, Zircuit, which is built on top of Geth and the OP stack. The SLS protocol described can be easily generalized to other rollup designs, and can be used for purposes other than security. |

These light clients must maintain robust security to protect the blockchain's integrity for users of applications built upon it, achieving this with minimal resources and without significant latency. Moreover, different applications have varying security needs. This work focuses on addressing these two key requirements in the context of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains and identifying the fundamental cost-latency trade-offs to achieve tailored, optimal security for each light client.   The key security guarantee of PoS blockchains is economic (implied by the "stake"). In this paper we formalize this cryptoeconomic security to light clients, ensuring that the cost of corrupting the data provided to light clients must outweigh the potential profit, thereby economically deterring malicious actors. We further introduce "insured" cryptoeconomic security to light clients, providing unconditional protection via the attribution of adversarial actions and the consequent slashing of stakes. The divisible and fungible nature of stake facilitates programmable security, allowing for customization of the security level and insurance amount according to the specific needs of different applications.   We implemented the protocols in less than 1000 lines of Solidity and TypeScript code and evaluated their gas cost, latency, and the computational overhead. For example, for a transaction with value of \ $32k, the light client can choose between zero cost with a latency of 5 hours or instant confirmation with an insurance cost of \$ 7.45. Thus, the client can select the optimal point on the latency-cost trade-off spectrum that best aligns with its needs. Light clients require negligible storage and face minimal computational costs,... |

Is today's blockchain decentralized? In this paper, we empirically studied one of the least decentralized parts of Ethereum, its builder market.   The builder market was introduced to fairly distribute Maximal Extractable Values (MEV) among validators and avoid validator centralization. As of the time of writing, three builders produced the vast majority (more than 80%) of blocks in Ethereum, creating a concerning centralization factor. However, the community believes that such centralization is okay, arguing that builder centralization will not lead to validator centralization. In this empirical study, we interrogate the causes and implications of builder centralization and challenge this belief that it is acceptable.   Our main finding is that builder centralization has led to a significant loss by validators and, if left uncontrolled, could lead to validator centralization. Moreover, MEV mitigation solutions slated for adoption are affected too because they rely on the builder market as an MEV oracle, which is made inaccurate by centralization.   Our investigation revealed two reasons behind builder centralization. We propose a structural change to the existing MEV supply chain and a solution based on the new supply chain structure. However, future work is required to analyze if the new supply chain structure is sustainable in the long term, which we leave open. |

In particular, resource constrained IoT devices may rely on fog-computing to alleviate the computing load of IoT tasks. Mutual authentication is needed between IoT and fog to preserve IoT data security, and monetization of fog services is needed to promote the fog service ecosystem. However, there is no guarantee that fog nodes will always respond to IoT requests correctly, either intentionally or accidentally. In the public decentralized IoT-fog environment, it is crucial to enforce integrity among fog nodes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system that 1) streamlines the mutual authentication service monetization between IoT and fog, 2) verifies the integrity of fog nodes via service audits, and 3) discourages malicious activity and promotes honesty among fog nodes through incentives and penalties. |

As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases, artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for resource management, data processing, and knowledge acquisition. To address those issues, federated learning (FL) has introduced a novel approach to building a versatile, large-scale machine learning framework that operates in a decentralized and hardware-agnostic manner. However, FL faces network bandwidth limitations and data breaches. To reduce the central dependency in FL and increase scalability, swarm learning (SL) has been proposed in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). SL represents a decentralized machine learning framework that leverages blockchain technology for secure, scalable, and private data management. A blockchain-based network enables the exchange and aggregation of model parameters among participants, thus mitigating the risk of a single point of failure and eliminating communication bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to introduce the principles of Swarm Learning, its architectural design, and its fields of application. In addition, it highlights numerous research avenues that require further exploration by academic and industry communities to unlock the full potential and applications of SL. |

An example of Confirmation Ruble is the Bitcoin's longest chain Confirmation Rule where a block $b$ is confirmed (with high probability) when it has a sufficiently long chain of successors, its siblings have notably shorter successor chains, the majority of the network's total computation power (hashing) is controlled by honest nodes, and network synchrony holds.   The only Confirmation Rule currently available in the Ethereum protocol, Gasper, is the FFG Finalization Rule. While this Confirmation Rule works under asynchronous network conditions, it is quite slow for many use cases. Specifically, best-case scenario, it takes around 13 to 19 min to confirm a transaction, where the actual figure depends on when the transaction is submitted to the network.   In this work, we devise a Fast Confirmation Rule for Ethereum's consensus protocol. Our Confirmation Rule relies on synchrony conditions, but provides a best-case confirmation time of 12 seconds only, greatly improving on the latency of the FFG Finalization Rule.   Users can then rely on the Confirmation Rule that best suits their needs depending on their belief about the network conditions and the need for a quick response. |

Utilizing a set of open-source tools, our methodology systematically attributes price improvements to specific modifiable inputs of the system such as routing efficiency, gas optimization, and priority fee settings. When applied to leading Ethereum-based trading interfaces such as 1Inch and Uniswap, the results reveal that auction-enhanced interfaces can provide statistically significant improvements in trading outcomes, averaging 4-5 basis points in our sample. We further identify the sources of such price improvements to be added liquidity for large swaps. This research lays a foundation for future innovations in blockchain based trading platforms. |

By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust to adjustably transparent enacted in these two documents, and consequently the Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how blockchain systems are being designated as "decentral" but have recentralizing effects where the state reinvents and re-establishes itself as an intermediary. The paper illustrates how discursive shifts concerning trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation are crucial sites for investigating redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems. |
|**2024-04-30**|**Blockchain Price vs. Quantity Controls**|Abdoulaye Ndiaye et.al.|[2405.00235](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00235)| This paper studies the optimal transaction fee mechanisms for blockchains, focusing on the distinction between price-based ( $\mathcal{P}$) and quantity-based ($\mathcal{Q}$) controls. By analyzing factors such as demand uncertainty, validator costs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations, price elasticity of demand, and levels of decentralization, we establish criteria that determine the selection of transaction fee mechanisms. We present a model framed around a Nash bargaining game, exploring how blockchain designers and validators negotiate fee structures to balance network welfare with profitability. Our findings suggest that the choice between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ mechanisms depends critically on the blockchain's specific technical and economic features. The study concludes that no single mechanism suits all contexts and highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that adaptively combine features of both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ to meet varying demands and market conditions. |
|**2024-09-06**|**Rolling in the Shadows: Analyzing the Extraction of MEV Across Layer-2 Rollups**|Christof Ferreira Torres et.al.|[2405.00138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00138)| The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks. |

However, they are renownedly affected by critical shortcomings, such as a lack of financial sustainability and operational efficiency. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have shown significant revolutionary influence in several sectors, including finance and banking, thanks to the full operational traceability they bring alongside verifiable computation. Nevertheless, the potential synergy between DLTs and CGSs has not been thoroughly investigated yet. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to utilise DLTs, particularly blockchain technologies, in CGS processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we compare key architectural characteristics considering access level, governance structure, and consensus method, to examine their fit with CGS processes. We believe this study can guide policymakers and stakeholders, thereby stimulating further innovation in this promising field. |

Currently, no globally effective method can quantify the safety, security, and Sustainability of all ASOs in orbit. Existing methods such as the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) rely on volunteering private information to provide sustainability ratings. However, the need for such sensitive data might prove to be a barrier to adoption for space entities. For effective comparison of ASOs, the rating mechanism should apply to all ASOs, even retroactively, so that the sustainability of a single ASO can be assessed holistically. Lastly, geopolitical boundaries and alignments play a crucial and limiting role in a volunteered rating system, limiting the space safety, security, and sustainability. This work presents a Live Detectability, Identifiability, and Trackability (L-DIT) score through a distributed app (dApp) built on top of the Behavioral Dynamics blockchain (BDB). The BDB chain is a space situational awareness (SSA) chain that provides verified and cross-checked ASO data from multiple sources. This unique combination of consensus-based information from BDB and permissionless access to data allows the DIT scoring method presented here to be applied to all ASOs. While the underlying BDB chain collects, filters, and validates SSA data from various open (and closed if available) sources, the L-DIT dApp consumes the data from the chain to provide L-DIT score that can contribute towards an operator's, manufacturer's, or owner's sustainability practices. Our dApp provides data for all ASOs, allowing their sustainability score to be compared against other ASOs, regardless of geopolitical alignments, providing business value to entities such as space insurance providers and enabling compliance validation and enforcement. |

Unlike any prior data source, blockchain datasets encompass multiple layers of interactions across real-world entities, e.g., human users, autonomous programs, and smart contracts. Furthermore, blockchain's integration with cryptocurrencies has introduced financial aspects of unprecedented scale and complexity such as decentralized finance, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, and central bank digital currencies. These unique characteristics present both opportunities and challenges for machine learning on blockchain data.   On one hand, we examine the state-of-the-art solutions, applications, and future directions associated with leveraging machine learning for blockchain data analysis critical for the improvement of blockchain technology such as e-crime detection and trends prediction. On the other hand, we shed light on the pivotal role of blockchain by providing vast datasets and tools that can catalyze the growth of the evolving machine learning ecosystem. This paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, offering a roadmap for navigating this dynamic and transformative field. |

The current lack of incentives and transparency harms the credibility of this process. Researchers are neither rewarded for superior nor penalized for bad reviews. Additionally, confidential reports cause a loss of insights and make the review process vulnerable to scientific misconduct. We propose a community-owned and -governed system that 1) remunerates reviewers for their efforts, 2) publishes the (anonymized) reports for scrutiny by the community, 3) tracks reputation of reviewers and 4) provides digital certificates. Automated by transparent smart-contract blockchain technology, the system aims to increase quality and speed of peer review while lowering the chance and impact of erroneous judgements. |

The ongoing quest to exploit vulnerabilities emphasizes how critical it is to expand on current research initiatives. Thus, using a methodology based on discrete blockchain layers, our survey study aims to broaden the existing body of knowledge by thoroughly discussing both new and known attack vectors inside the blockchain ecosystem. This survey proposes a novel classification of blockchain attacks and an in-depth investigation of blockchain data security. In particular, the paper provides a thorough discussion of the attack techniques and vulnerabilities that are specific to each tier, along with a detailed look at mitigating techniques. We reveal the deep dynamics of these security concerns by closely investigating the fundamental causes of attacks at various blockchain tiers. We clarify mitigation methods for known vulnerabilities and offer new information on recently developed attack vectors. We also discuss the implications of quantum computing in blockchain and the weaknesses in the current technology that can be exploited in the future. Our study advances the field of blockchain security and privacy research while also contributing to our understanding of blockchain vulnerabilities and attacks. This survey paper is a useful tool for readers who want to learn more about the intricacies of blockchain security. It also invites researchers to help strengthen blockchain privacy and security, paving the way for further developments in this dynamic and ever-evolving field. |
|**2024-04-27**|**Solvent: liquidity verification of smart contracts**|Massimo Bartoletti et.al.|[2404.17864](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17864)| Smart contracts are programs executed by blockchains networks to regulate the exchange of crypto-assets between untrusted users. Due to their immutability, public accessibility and high value at stake, smart contracts are an attractive target for attackers, as evidenced by a long history of security incidents. This has been a driving factor for the application of formal methods to Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, and Solidity, its main smart contract language, which have become the target of dozens of verification tools with varying objectives. A current limitation of these tools is that they are not really effective in expressing and verifying liquidity properties regarding the exchange of crypto-assets: for example, is it true that in every reachable state a user can fire a sequence of transactions to withdraw a given amount of crypto-assets? We propose Solvent, a tool aimed at verifying these kinds of properties, which are beyond the reach of existing verification tools for Solidity. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Solvent through a common benchmark of smart contracts. |
|**2024-04-27**|**Improving Smart Contract Security with Contrastive Learning-based Vulnerability Detection**|Yizhou Chen et.al.|[2404.17839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17839)| Currently, smart contract vulnerabilities (SCVs) have emerged as a major factor threatening the transaction security of blockchain. Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level.   To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a contrastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training process of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all baseline methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods. |

With the exponential growth of transactions in the realm of Blockchain, especially in Bitcoin, Blockchain size increases as all transactions must be stored and verified. In Bitcoin, validating M of N transactions involves the necessity of M authentic signatures out of the total N transactions. This procedure is so time-consuming and needs a significant storage capacity. To address these issues, several multi signature schemes have been proposed, enabling users to interactively generate a common signature on a single message. Recently, some lattice based multi signature schemes have been presented to deal with the threats of quantum computers. However, none of them have met all desirable features of multi signature schemes like aggregate public key, low numbers of communication rounds, or resistant to quantum computers. Within this paper, we present a new multi signature scheme based on lattices, known as Razhims, that has aggregate public key, necessitates solely a single round of communication, and is resistant to quantum computers. In Razhims, the aggregate public key size and the final signature size are equal to the public key size and the final signature size of a standard signature respectively, and are independent of the number of signers. |

However, cloud security concerns introduce new risks and challenges related to data protection, sharing, and access control. A synergistic integration of blockchain with the cloud holds immense potential. Blockchain's distributed ledger ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency as it reduces the reliance on centralized authorities. Motivated by this, our framework proposes a secure data ecosystem in the cloud with the key aspects being Data Rights, Data Sharing, and Data Validation. Also, this approach aims to increase its interoperability and scalability by eliminating the need for data migration. This will ensure that existing public cloud-based systems can easily deploy blockchain enhancing trustworthiness and non-repudiation of cloud data. |

Yet, user privacy is at risk due to frequent data collection. Existing privacy schemes face vulnerability with quantum machines. To tackle this, the LPM2DA scheme is introduced, utilizing lattice-based encryption and signatures for secure data aggregation. It ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication, enabling statistical analysis while preserving user privacy. Traditional aggregation schemes suffer from weak network models and centralization issues. Enter SPDBlock, a blockchain-based solution ensuring privacy, integrity, and resistance to attacks. It detects and prosecutes malicious entities while efficiently handling multi-dimensional data transmission. Through distributed decryption and secret sharing, only valid data can be decrypted with minimal involvement from smart meters. Performance tests reveal SPDBlock's superiority in communication and computational efficiency over traditional schemes. |

The installation of such sources, like photovoltaic panels, while environmentally beneficial, is cost-prohibitive for many. Those lacking photovoltaic solutions typically resort to purchasing energy from utility grids that often rely on fossil fuels. Moreover, when users produce their own energy, they may generate excess that goes unused, leading to inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes innovative blockchain-enabled energy-sharing algorithms that allow consumers -- without financial means -- to access energy through the use of their own energy storage units. We explore two sharing models: a centralized method and a peer-to-peer (P2P) one. Our analysis reveals that the P2P model is more effective, enhancing the sharing process significantly compared to the centralized method. We also demonstrate that, when contrasted with traditional battery-supported trading algorithm, the P2P sharing algorithm substantially reduces wasted energy and energy purchases from the grid by 73.6%, and 12.3% respectively. The proposed system utilizes smart contracts to decentralize its structure, address the single point of failure concern, improve overall system transparency, and facilitate peer-to-peer payments. |

This mechanism aims to reduce the voting power of validators who are unreachable within the network, reallocating this power to active validators. This paper investigates the implications of the inactivity leak on safety within the Ethereum blockchain. Our theoretical analysis reveals scenarios where actions by Byzantine validators expedite the finalization of two conflicting branches, and instances where Byzantine validators reach a voting power exceeding the critical safety threshold of one-third. Additionally, we revisit the probabilistic bouncing attack, illustrating how the inactivity leak can result in a probabilistic breach of safety, potentially allowing Byzantine validators to exceed the one-third safety threshold. Our findings uncover how penalizing inactive nodes can compromise blockchain properties, particularly in the presence of Byzantine validators capable of coordinating actions. |

An off-chain storage layer, which lies between the application and the blockchain layers, can improve space efficiency and data availability with erasure codes and decentralized maintenance. This paper presents two fundamental components of such storage layer designed and implemented for the IPFS network. The IPFS Community is a component built on top of the IPFS network that encodes and decodes data before uploading to the network. Since data is encoded with alpha entanglement codes, the solution requires less storage space than the native IPFS solution which replicates data by pinning content with the IPFS Cluster. To detect and repair failures in a timely manner, we introduce the monitoring and repair component. This novel component is activated by any node and distributes the load of repairs among various nodes. These two components are implemented as pluggable modules, and can, therefore, be easily migrated to other distributed file systems by adjusting the connector component. |
|**2024-04-24**|**A Rollup Comparison Framework**|Jan Gorzny et.al.|[2404.16150](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16150)| Rollups are a popular blockchain paradigm where one blockchain network is anchored to a different blockchain network, typically though smart contracts and data commitments. The rollup executes transactions on its own network and periodically publishes them along with the state root of the rollup network. The state root is determined to be final by a protocol, often enforced by smart contracts on the anchoring blockchain, which may let the state roots be challenged or verify an accompanying validity proof. While this core functionality is universal to existing rollups, these systems have introduced unique features as they vie for users and market dominance. In this paper, we aim to classify ways in which these rollups differ in order to establish a common ground of understanding. We explore various dimensions in which these system can differ: familiarity, finality time, modularity, and maturity. The result is a framework that can be used to understand and compare the properties of rollups. |

However, the commonly deployed PoW implementations are all based on solving cryptographic puzzles. Researchers have been pursuing the compelling idea of replacing cryptopuzzles with useful computing tasks for over a decade, in face of the substantial computational capacity of blockchain networks and the global pursuit of a more sustainable IT infrastructure. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prerequisites for alternative classes of tasks. We provide insight into the effect of introducing "usefulness" and of transitioning to task classes other than cryptopuzzles. Having distilled the prerequisites, we use them to examine proposed designs from existing literature. Finally, we discuss pertinent techniques and present research gaps in the current state-of-the-art. |

Opaque, centralized services that compelled trust from users are replaced by trustless, decentralized systems of smart contracts. However, the public nature of blockchain-based databases, on which smart contracts transact, has typically presented a challenge for applications that depend on data privacy or that rely on participants having incomplete information. This has changed with the introduction of confidential smart contract networks that encrypt the memory state of active contracts as well as their databases stored on-chain. With confidentiality, contracts can more readily implement novel interaction mechanisms that were previously infeasible. Meanwhile, in both Web 2.0 and Web3 applications the user interface continues to play a crucial role in translating user intent into actionable requests. In many cases, developers have shifted intelligence and autonomy into the client-side, leveraging Web technologies for compute, graphics, and networking. Web3's reliance on such frontends has revealed a pain point though, namely that decentralized applications are not accessible to end users without a persistent host serving the application. Here we introduce the Non-Fungible Program (NFP) model for developing self-contained frontend applications that are distributed via blockchain, powered by Web technology, and backed by private databases persisted in encrypted smart contracts. Access to frontend code, as well as backend services, is controlled and guaranteed by smart contracts according to the NFT ownership model, eliminating the need for a separate host. By extension, NFP applications bring interactivity to token owners and enable new functionalities, such as authorization mechanisms for oracles, supplementary Web services, and overlay networks in a secure manner.

However, data in the medical field is often highly private, preventing different hospitals from sharing data to train an accurate model. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving machine learning architecture, has shown promising performance in balancing data privacy and model utility by keeping private data on the client's side and using a central server to coordinate a set of clients for model training through aggregating their uploaded model parameters. Yet, this architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party server, which is challenging to achieve in real life. Swarm learning, as a specialized decentralized federated learning architecture that does not require a central server, utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct parameter exchanges between clients. However, the mining of blocks requires significant computational resources, limiting its scalability. To address this issue, this paper integrates the brain storm optimization algorithm into the swarm learning framework, named BSO-SL. This approach clusters similar clients into different groups based on their model distributions. Additionally, leveraging the architecture of BSO, clients are given the probability to engage in collaborative learning both within their cluster and with clients outside their cluster, preventing the model from converging to local optima. The proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. |
|**2024-07-07**|**Correlations versus noise in the NFT market**|Marcin Wątorek et.al.|[2404.15495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15495)| The non-fungible token (NFT) market emerges as a recent trading innovation leveraging blockchain technology, mirroring the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The current study is based on the capitalization changes and transaction volumes across a large number of token collections on the Ethereum platform. In order to deepen the understanding of the market dynamics, the collection-collection dependencies are examined by using the multivariate formalism of detrended correlation coefficient and correlation matrix. It appears that correlation strength is lower here than that observed in previously studied markets. Consequently, the eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrix more closely follow the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, still, some departures indicating the existence of correlations remain. The comparison of results obtained from the correlation matrix built from the Pearson coefficients and, independently, from the detrended cross-correlation coefficients suggests that the global correlations in the NFT market arise from higher frequency fluctuations. Corresponding minimal spanning trees (MSTs) for capitalization variability exhibit a scale-free character while, for the number of transactions, they are somewhat more decentralized. |

This concept refers to Internet of Things (IoT), bringing information and control capabilities in many fields like medicine, smart homes, home security, etc. Main drawbacks of IoT environment are its dependency on Internet connectivity and need continuous devices power. These dependencies may affect system performances, namely request processing response times. In this context, we propose in this paper a continuous performance monitoring methodology, applied on IoT systems based on Publish/subscribe communication model. Our approach assesses performances using Stochastic Petri net modeling, and self-optimizes whenever poor performances are detected. Our approach relies on a Stochastic Petri nets modelling and analysis to assess performances. We target improving performances, in particular response times, by online modification of influencing factors. |

While many runtime monitoring and guarding mechanisms have been proposed to validate invariants and stop anomalous transactions on the fly, the empirical effectiveness of the invariants used remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we studied 23 prevalent invariants of 8 categories, which are either deployed in high-profile protocols or endorsed by leading auditing firms and security experts. Using these well-established invariants as templates, we developed a tool Trace2Inv which dynamically generates new invariants customized for a given contract based on its historical transaction data.   We evaluated Trace2Inv on 42 smart contracts that fell victim to 27 distinct exploits on the Ethereum blockchain. Our findings reveal that the most effective invariant guard alone can successfully block 18 of the 27 identified exploits with minimal gas overhead. Our analysis also shows that most of the invariants remain effective even when the experienced attackers attempt to bypass them. Additionally, we studied the possibility of combining multiple invariant guards, resulting in blocking up to 23 of the 27 benchmark exploits and achieving false positive rates as low as 0.32%. Trace2Inv outperforms current state-of-the-art works on smart contract invariant mining and transaction attack detection in terms of both practicality and accuracy. Though Trace2Inv is not primarily designed for transaction attack detection, it surprisingly found two previously unreported exploit transactions, earlier than any reported exploit transactions against the same victim contracts. |

Users are able to orchestrate the whole blockchain network using a single web based interface, for example they are able to set the topology of the peer-to-peer (P2P) connections and control the initialization parameters. Each Raspberry Pi has a screen attached which visualizes current state of local blockchain, allowing users to easily visualize the consensus of the network in real time. We show how this platform can be used to perform experiments on consensus quality while using different P2P topologies. Similar experiments can be used for demonstration purposes in a workshop or other educational settings. |

A major advantage of Snowman is that each consensus decision only requires an expected constant communication overhead per processor in the `common' case that the protocol is not under substantial Byzantine attack, i.e. it provides a solution to the scalability problem which ensures that the expected communication overhead per processor is independent of the total number of processors $n$ during normal operation. This is the key property that would enable a consensus protocol to scale to 10,000 or more independent validators (i.e. processors). On the other hand, the two following concerns have remained:   (1) Providing formal proofs of consistency for Snowman has presented a formidable challenge.   (2) Liveness attacks exist in the case that a Byzantine adversary controls more than $O(\sqrt{n})$ processors, slowing termination to more than a logarithmic number of steps.   In this paper, we address the two issues above. We consider a Byzantine adversary that controls at most $f<n/5$ processors. First, we provide a simple proof of consistency for Snowman. Then we supplement Snowman with a `liveness module' that can be triggered in the case that a substantial adversary launches a liveness attack, and which guarantees liveness in this event by temporarily forgoing the communication complexity advantages of Snowman, but without sacrificing these low communication complexity advantages during normal operation. |

To solve the problem that blockchain systems cannot access off-chain data, oracle is introduced. However, existing research mainly focuses on the consistency and integrity of data, but ignores the problem that oracle nodes may be externally attacked or provide false data for selfish motives, resulting in the unresolved problem of data accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new Decentralized Testing architecture (DecTest) that aims to improve data accuracy. A blockchain oracle random secret testing mechanism is first proposed to enhance the monitoring and verification of nodes by introducing a dynamic anonymized question-verification committee. Based on this, a comprehensive evaluation incentive mechanism is designed to incentivize honest work performance by evaluating nodes based on their reputation scores. The simulation results show that we successfully reduced the discrete entropy value of the acquired data and the real value of the data by 61.4%. |

The operation of blockchain is governed by consensus algorithms, among which Proof of Stake (PoS) is popular yet has its drawbacks, notably the potential for centralising power in nodes with larger stakes or higher rewards. Fuzzychain, our proposed solution, introduces the use of fuzzy sets to define stake semantics, promoting decentralised and distributed processing control. This system selects validators based on their degree of membership to the stake fuzzy sets rather than just the size of their stakes. As a pioneer proposal in applying fuzzy sets to blockchain, Fuzzychain aims to rectify PoS's limitations. Our results indicate that Fuzzychain not only matches PoS in functionality but also ensures a fairer distribution of stakes among validators, leading to more inclusive validator selection and a better-distributed network. |

To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps) domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to existing baselines |

Despite their widespread use, a comprehensive understanding of the probabilistic aspects of data security in these structures remains a gap in current research. Our study aims to bridge this gap by developing a theoretical framework to calculate the probability of data falsification, taking into account various scenarios based on the length of the Merkle path and hash length. The research progresses from the derivation of an exact formula for falsification probability to an approximation suitable for cases with significantly large hash lengths. Empirical experiments validate the theoretical models, exploring simulations with diverse hash lengths and Merkle path lengths. The findings reveal a decrease in falsification probability with increasing hash length and an inverse relationship with longer Merkle paths. A numerical analysis quantifies the discrepancy between exact and approximate probabilities, underscoring the conditions for the effective application of the approximation. This work offers crucial insights into optimizing Merkle Tree structures for bolstering security in blockchain and IoT systems, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and data integrity. |

This paper explores the integration of blockchain technology in biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger and tokenization affordances, presents a groundbreaking solution for the accurate monitoring and tracking of environmental assets, thereby addressing the critical need for transparency and trust in conservation efforts. Unlike previous more theoretical approaches, by addressing the research question of how blockchain supports digital resilience in biodiversity conservation, this study presents a grounded framework that justifies which blockchain features are essential to decipher specific data contribution and data leveraging processes in an effort to protect our planet's biodiversity, while boosting potential economic benefits for all actors involved, from local farmers, to hardware vendors and artificial intelligence experts, to investors and regular users, volunteers and donors. |

By employing blockchain for security and integrity, DeFi creates new possibilities that attract retail and institution users, including central banks. Given its novel applications and sophisticated designs, the distinction between DeFi services and understanding the risk involved is often complex. This work systematically presents the major categories of DeFi protocols that cover over 90\% of total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. It establishes a structured methodology to differentiate between DeFi protocols based on their design and architecture. Every DeFi protocol is classified into one of three groups: liquidity pools, pegged and synthetic tokens, and aggregator protocols, followed by risk analysis. In particular, we classify stablecoins, liquid staking tokens, and bridged (wrapped) assets as pegged tokens resembling similar risks. The full risk exposure of DeFi users is derived not only from the DeFi protocol design but also from how it is used and with which tokens. |
|**2024-04-17**|**The Writing is on the Wall: Analyzing the Boom of Inscriptions and its Impact on Rollup Performance and Cost Efficiency**|Krzysztof Gogol et.al.|[2404.11189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11189)| Late 2023 witnessed significant user activity on EVM chains, resulting in a surge in transaction activity and putting many rollups into the first live test. While some rollups performed well, some others experienced downtime during this period, affecting transaction finality time and gas fees. To address the lack of empirical research on rollups, we perform the first study during a heightened activity during the late 2023 transaction boom, as attributed to inscriptions - a novel technique that enables NFT and ERC-20 token creation on Bitcoin and other blockchains. We observe that minting inscription-based meme tokens on zkSync Era allows for trading at a fraction of the costs, compared to the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. We also found that the increased transaction activity, over 99% attributed to the minting of new inscription tokens, positively affected other users of zkSync Era, resulting in lowered gas fees. Unlike L1 blockchains, ZK rollups may experience lower gas fees with increased transaction volume. Lastly, the introduction of blobs - a form of temporary data storage - decreased the gas costs of Ethereum rollups, but also raised a number of questions about the security of inscription-based tokens. |
|**2024-04-17**|**Do you need a DAO?**|Henrik Axelsen et.al.|[2404.11076](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11076)| Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have seen exponential growth and interest due to their potential to redefine organizational structure and governance. Despite this, there is a discrepancy between the ideals of autonomy and decentralization and the actual experiences of DAO stakeholders. The Information Systems (IS) literature has yet to fully explore whether DAOs are the optimal organizational choice. Addressing this gap, our research asks, "Is a DAO suitable for your organizational needs?" We derive a gated decision-making framework through a thematic review of the academic and grey literature on DAOs. Through five scenarios, the framework critically emphasizes the gaps between DAOs' theoretical capabilities and practical challenges. Our findings contribute to the IS discourse on blockchain technologies, with some ancillary contributions to the IS literature on organizational management and practitioner literature. |

This tutorial explores FL and BC integration, offering a secure and privacy-preserving approach to healthcare analytics. FL enables decentralized model training on local devices at healthcare institutions, keeping patient data localized. This facilitates collaborative model development without compromising privacy. However, FL introduces vulnerabilities. BC, with its tamper-proof ledger and smart contracts, provides a robust framework for secure collaborative learning in FL. After presenting a taxonomy for the various types of data used in ML in medical applications, and a concise review of ML techniques for healthcare use cases, this tutorial explores three integration architectures for balancing decentralization, scalability, and reliability in healthcare data. Furthermore, it investigates how BCFL enhances data security and collaboration in disease prediction, medical image analysis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery. By providing a tutorial on FL, blockchain, and their integration, along with a review of BCFL applications, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage these technologies for secure and privacy-preserving healthcare ML. It aims to accelerate advancements in secure and collaborative healthcare analytics, ultimately improving patient outcomes. |

PoS-based blockchains require an initial stake distribution among the participants. Typically, this initial stake distribution is called bootstrapping. This paper argues that existing bootstrapping protocols are prone to centralization. To address centralization due to bootstrapping, we propose a novel game $\Gamma_\textsf{bootstrap}$. Next, we define three conditions: (i) Individual Rationality (IR), (ii) Incentive Compatibility (IC), and (iii) $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)-$ Decentralization that an \emph{ideal} bootstrapping protocol must satisfy. $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)$ are certain parameters to quantify decentralization. Towards this, we propose a novel centralization metric, C-NORM, to measure centralization in a PoS System. We define a centralization game -- $\Gamma_\textsf{cent}$ , to analyze the efficacy of centralization metrics. We show that C-NORM effectively captures centralization in the presence of strategic players capable of launching Sybil attacks. With C-NORM, we analyze popular bootstrapping protocols such as Airdrop and Proof-of-Burn (PoB) and prove that they do not satisfy IC and IR, respectively. Motivated by the Ethereum Merge, we study W2SB (a PoW-based bootstrapping protocol) and prove it is ideal. In addition, we conduct synthetic simulations to empirically validate that W2SB bootstrapped PoS is decentralized. |

To improve scalability, researchers have turned to the study of cross-chain state channels. However, most of the existing schemes rely on trusted parties to support channel operations. To address this issue, we present Interpipe: a distributed cross-chain state channel scheme. Specifically, we propose a real-time cross-chain synchronization scheme to ensure consistent operations between two blockchains to a cross-chain state channel. Moreover, we propose a batch transaction proof scheme based on recursive SNARK to meet the cross-chain verification needs of large-scale users. Based on the above designs, Interpipe offers protocols for opening, updating, closing, and disputing operations to cross-chain state channels. Security analysis shows that Interpipe has consistency and resistance, and experimental results demonstrate that a cross-chain state channel can be nearly as efficient as an existing intra-chain state channel. |

Design decisions are detailed and challenges are addressed. The architecture is being implemented using Golang and can be run inside the CbmRoot software environment. The goal is to build a bridge between the disciplines HEP and blockchain to build a novel blockchain network in which the network's computational power is not wasted but instead used to support a scientific experiment while at the same time securing the underlying permissioned blockchain. The blockchain features a token-based cryptocurrency that is rewarded to miners that donate computational power and acts as an additional incentive to participate which traditional volunteer computing can not provide. The implementation named gophy is being implemented in Golang and is expected to be open-sourced before the end of 2024. |
|**2024-04-24**|**SQIAsignHD: SQIsignHD Adaptor Signature**|Farzin Renan et.al.|[2404.09026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09026)| Adaptor signatures can be viewed as a generalized form of the standard digital signature schemes where a secret randomness is hidden within a signature. Adaptor signatures are a recent cryptographic primitive and are becoming an important tool for blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies to reduce on-chain costs, improve fungibility, and contribute to off-chain forms of payment in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, currently used adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum adversaries due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$ , a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, as the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, show that our scheme is secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). |
|**2024-07-14**|**Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security**|Zishuo Zhao et.al.|[2404.09005](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005)| Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$ . Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age. |

By utilizing an extensive dataset of 3,576 fan token polls, we reveal that fan tokens engage an average of 4,003 participants per poll, representing around 50% of token holders, underscoring their relative effectiveness in boosting fan engagement. The analyses identify significant determinants of fan token poll participation, including levels of voter (dis-)agreement, poll type, sports sectors, demographics, and club-level factors. This study provides valuable stakeholder insights into the current state of adoption and voting trends for fan token polls. It also suggests strategies for increasing fan engagement, thereby optimizing the utility of fan tokens in sports. Moreover, we highlight the broader applicability of fan token principles to any community, brand, or organization focused on customer engagement, suggesting a wider potential for this digital innovation. |

By employing numerous Mobile AIGC Service Providers (MASPs), ubiquitous and low-latency AIGC services for clients can be realized. Nonetheless, the interactions between clients and MASPs in public mobile networks, pertaining to three key mechanisms, namely MASP selection, payment scheme, and fee-ownership transfer, are unprotected. In this paper, we design the above mechanisms using a systematic approach and present the first blockchain to protect mobile AIGC, called ProSecutor. Specifically, by roll-up and layer-2 channels, ProSecutor forms a two-layer architecture, realizing tamper-proof data recording and atomic fee-ownership transfer with high resource efficiency. Then, we present the Objective-Subjective Service Assessment (OS^{2}A) framework, which effectively evaluates the AIGC services by fusing the objective service quality with the reputation-based subjective experience of the service outcome (i.e., AIGC outputs). Deploying OS^{2}A on ProSecutor, firstly, the MASP selection can be realized by sorting the reputation. Afterward, the contract theory is adopted to optimize the payment scheme and help clients avoid moral hazards in mobile networks. We implement the prototype of ProSecutor on BlockEmulator.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProSecutor achieves 12.5x throughput and saves 67.5\% storage resources compared with BlockEmulator. Moreover, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanisms are validated. |

We propose DeFaaS, a decentralized FaaS system leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized API management. DeFaaS addresses these limitations by establishing a secure, transparent registry of functions on a blockchain and enabling applications to discover and invoke them. This approach fosters scalability, flexibility, enhanced security, and improved reliability. Furthermore, DeFaaS's architecture extends beyond decentralized FaaS, supporting other distributed computing scenarios like dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service meshes. DeFaaS represents a significant advancement in decentralized computing with the potential to unlock a multitude of novel applications and use cases. |

Through integration with mobile edge networks, mobile AIGC networks have gained significant attention, which can provide real-time customized and personalized AIGC services and products. Since blockchains can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management, AIGC products can be securely managed by blockchain to avoid tampering and plagiarization. However, the evolution of blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as improving information propagation efficiency to enable blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based information propagation optimization framework for blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. We first innovatively apply age of information as a data-freshness metric to measure information propagation efficiency in public blockchains. Considering that GATs possess the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT to obtain the optimal information propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding information propagation efficiency compared with traditional routing mechanisms. |

By leveraging cryptographic proof mechanisms, Bitcoin eliminates the reliance on third-party financial institutions. Ethereum, ranking as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, builds upon Bitcoin's groundwork by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum strives to surpass the limitations of Bitcoin's scripting language, achieving full Turing-completeness for executing intricate computational tasks. Solana introduces a novel architecture for high-performance blockchain, employing timestamps to validate decentralized transactions and significantly boosting block creation throughput. Through a comprehensive examination of these blockchain technologies, their distinctions, and the associated challenges, this paper aims to offer valuable insights and comparative analysis for both researchers and practitioners. |
|**2024-04-06**|**Towards a low carbon proof-of-work blockchain**|Agron Gemajli et.al.|[2404.04729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04729)| Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains burn a lot of energy. Proof-of-work algorithms are expensive by design and often only serve to compute blockchains. In some sense, carbon-based and non-carbon based regional electric power is fungible. So the total carbon and non-carbon electric power mix plays a role. Thus, generally PoW algorithms have large CO $_2$ footprints solely for computing blockchains. A proof of technology is described towards replacing hashcash or other PoW methods with a lottery and proof-of-VM (PoVM) emulation. PoVM emulation is a form of PoW where an autonomous blockchain miner gets a lottery ticket in exchange for providing a VM (virtual Machine) for a specified period. These VMs get their jobs from a job queue. Managing and ensuring, by concensus, that autonomous PoVMs are properly configured and running as expected gives several gaps for a complete practical system. These gaps are discussed. Our system is similar to a number of other blockchain systems. We briefly survey these systems. This paper along with our proof of technology was done as a senior design project. |

We investigate the stability of blockchain sharding, where transactions are continuously generated by an adversarial model. The system consists of $n$ processing nodes that are divided into $s$ shards. Following the paradigm of classical adversarial queuing theory, transactions are continuously received at injection rate $\rho \leq 1$ and burstiness $b > 0$. We give an absolute upper bound $\max\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{ \left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\}$ on the maximum injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and latency of transactions, where $k$ is the number of shards that each transaction accesses. We next give a basic distributed scheduling algorithm for uniform systems where shards are equally close to each other. To guarantee stability, the injection rate is limited to $\rho \leq \max\{ \frac{1}{18k}, \frac{1}{\lceil 18 \sqrt{s} \rceil} \}$. We then provide a fully distributed scheduling algorithm for non-uniform systems where shards are arbitrarily far from each other. By using a hierarchical clustering of the shards, stability is guaranteed with injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{c_1d \log^2 s} \cdot \max\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \}$, where $d$ is the worst distance of any transaction to the shards it will access, and $c_1$ is some positive constant. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the algorithms and measure the average queue sizes and latency throughout the system. To our knowledge, this is the first adversarial stability analysis of sharded blockchain systems. |

|**2024-04-05**|**VELLET: Verifiable Embedded Wallet for Securing Authenticity and Integrity**|Hiroki Watanabe et.al.|[2404.03874](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03874)| The blockchain ecosystem, particularly with the rise of Web3 and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), has experienced a significant increase in users and applications. However, this expansion is challenged by the need to connect early adopters with a wider user base. A notable difficulty in this process is the complex interfaces of blockchain wallets, which can be daunting for those familiar with traditional payment methods. To address this issue, the category of "embedded wallets" has emerged as a promising solution. These wallets are seamlessly integrated into the front-end of decentralized applications (Dapps), simplifying the onboarding process for users and making access more widely available. However, our insights indicate that this simplification introduces a trade-off between ease of use and security. Embedded wallets lack transparency and auditability, leading to obscured transactions by the front end and a pronounced risk of fraud and phishing attacks. This paper proposes a new protocol to enhance the security of embedded wallets. Our VELLET protocol introduces a wallet verifier that can match the audit trail of embedded wallets on smart contracts, incorporating a process to verify authenticity and integrity. In the implementation architecture of the VELLET protocol, we suggest using the Text Record feature of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), known as a decentralized domain name service, to serve as a repository for managing the audit trails of smart contracts. This approach has been demonstrated to reduce the necessity for new smart contract development and operational costs, proving cost-effective through a proof-of-concept. This protocol is a vital step in reducing security risks associated with embedded wallets, ensuring their convenience does not undermine user security and trust. |

Zero Knowledge Login allows users to create and access their blockchain wallets just with their OAuth accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitch), while Sponsored Transactions eliminate the need for users to prepare transaction fees, as they can delegate fees to sponsors' accounts. Additionally, thanks to Sui's Storage Rebate feature, sponsors in Sponsored Transactions can profit from the sponsorship, achieving a win-win and sustainable service model. Zero Knowledge Login and Sponsored Transactions are pivotal in overcoming key challenges novice blockchain users face, particularly in managing private keys and depositing initial transaction fees. By addressing these challenges in the user experience of blockchain, Sui makes the blockchain more accessible and engaging for novice users and paves the way for the broader adoption of blockchain applications in everyday life. |

|**2024-04-02**|**What Blocks My Blockchain's Throughput? Developing a Generalizable Approach for Identifying Bottlenecks in Permissioned Blockchains**|Orestis Papageorgiou et.al.|[2404.02930](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02930)| Permissioned blockchains have been proposed for a variety of use cases that require decentralization yet address enterprise requirements that permissionless blockchains to date cannot satisfy -- particularly in terms of performance. However, popular permissioned blockchains still exhibit a relatively low maximum throughput in comparison to established centralized systems. Consequently, researchers have conducted several benchmarking studies on different permissioned blockchains to identify their limitations and -- in some cases -- their bottlenecks in an attempt to find avenues for improvement. Yet, these approaches are highly heterogeneous, difficult to compare, and require a high level of expertise in the implementation of the underlying specific blockchain. In this paper, we develop a more unified and graphical approach for identifying bottlenecks in permissioned blockchains based on a systematic review of related work, experiments with the Distributed Ledger Performance Scan (DLPS), and an extension of its graphical evaluation functionalities. We conduct in-depth case studies on Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum, two widely used permissioned blockchains with distinct architectural designs, demonstrating the adaptability of our framework across different blockchains. We provide researchers and practitioners working on evaluating or improving permissioned blockchains with a toolkit, guidelines on what data to document, and insights on how to proceed in the search process for bottlenecks. |
|**2024-04-03**|**The Societal Implications of Blockchain Proliferation**|Cory Cherven et.al.|[2404.02451](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02451)| Blockchain and its distributed ledger technology have far-reaching implications for consumers across the world. Cryptocurrencies like XRP work to solve key issues in the remittance industry, targeting corridors like Mexico where foreign remittance fuels economies. Blockchain's libertarian principles have the potential to change lives in the third world, replacing corrupt infrastructure with trust-based solutions. While this technology can be used to significantly improve lives, it has a wealth of destructive applications. Bitcoin's blockchain and nefarious websites like the Silk Road have fueled an underground market of drugs, money laundering, and terrorism, complicating digital currency legislation. The negative environmental effects of cryptocurrency may also contribute significantly to global climate change. Negatives aside, cryptocurrency still proves to be a valuable commodity in technological development. |

|**2024-04-01**|**Decentralized Collaborative Learning Framework with External Privacy Leakage Analysis**|Tsuyoshi Idé et.al.|[2404.01270](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01270)| This paper presents two methodological advancements in decentralized multi-task learning under privacy constraints, aiming to pave the way for future developments in next-generation Blockchain platforms. First, we expand the existing framework for collaborative dictionary learning (CollabDict), which has previously been limited to Gaussian mixture models, by incorporating deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) into the framework, with a particular focus on anomaly detection. We demonstrate that the VAE-based anomaly score function shares the same mathematical structure as the non-deep model, and provide comprehensive qualitative comparison. Second, considering the widespread use of "pre-trained models," we provide a mathematical analysis on data privacy leakage when models trained with CollabDict are shared externally. We show that the CollabDict approach, when applied to Gaussian mixtures, adheres to a Renyi differential privacy criterion. Additionally, we propose a practical metric for monitoring internal privacy breaches during the learning process. |

They emerged as a preferred method of staking within Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, owing to their ease of use and tradability. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we establish a general framework describing the design choices and protocols underlying liquid staking. We then employ the framework to systematically compare the top LST implementations, examining their node operator selection, validator operations, and staking rewards distribution models. We further discuss security concerns associated with liquid staking, its implications for PoS blockchain security, and Distributed Validator technology (DVT) as a potential solution. Finally, we empirically analyze LSTs' performance and find that the design choices and market events affect peg stability; particularly, LSTs with centralized governance and operations are more efficient in tracking staking rewards. |
|**2024-05-30**|**Eclipse Attack Detection on a Blockchain Network as a Non-Parametric Change Detection Problem**|Anurag Gupta et.al.|[2404.00538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00538)| This paper introduces a novel non-parametric change detection algorithm to identify eclipse attacks on a blockchain network; the non-parametric algorithm relies only on the empirical mean and variance of the dataset, making it highly adaptable. An eclipse attack occurs when malicious actors isolate blockchain users, disrupting their ability to reach consensus with the broader network, thereby distorting their local copy of the ledger. To detect an eclipse attack, we monitor changes in the Fr\'echet mean and variance of the evolving blockchain communication network connecting blockchain users. First, we leverage the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to project large-dimensional networks into a lower-dimensional space, preserving essential statistical properties. Subsequently, we employ a non-parametric change detection procedure, leading to a test statistic that converges weakly to a Brownian bridge process in the absence of an eclipse attack. This enables us to quantify the false alarm rate of the detector. Our detector can be implemented as a smart contract on the blockchain, offering a tamper-proof and reliable solution. Finally, we use numerical examples to compare the proposed eclipse attack detector with a detector based on the random forest model. |

By utilizing centralized or distributed trading, energy can be effectively managed and distributed across different regions, thereby achieving market equilibrium and satisfying both producers and consumers. However, recent years have presented unprecedented challenges and difficulties for the development of the energy market. These challenges include regional energy imbalances, volatile energy pricing, high computing costs, and issues related to transaction information disclosure. Researchers widely acknowledge that the security features of blockchain technology can enhance the efficiency of energy transactions and establish the fundamental stability and robustness of the energy market. This type of blockchain-enabled energy market is commonly referred to as an energy blockchain. Currently, there is a burgeoning amount of research in this field, encompassing algorithm design, framework construction, and practical application. It is crucial to organize and compare these research efforts to facilitate the further advancement of energy blockchain. This survey aims to comprehensively review the fundamental characteristics of blockchain and energy markets, highlighting the significant advantages of combining the two. Moreover, based on existing research outcomes, we will categorize and compare the current energy market research supported by blockchain in terms of algorithm design, market framework construction, and the policies and practical applications adopted by different countries. Finally, we will address current issues and propose potential future directions for improvement, to provide guidance for the practical implementation of blockchain in the energy market. |

Merging distributed computing with cryptographic techniques, decentralized technologies introduce a novel computing paradigm. Blockchain ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data management by validating and recording transactions via consensus across network nodes. Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning framework, enables participants to collaboratively train models while safeguarding data privacy by avoiding direct raw data exchange. Despite the growing interest in decentralized methods, their application in FL remains underexplored. This paper presents a thorough investigation into Blockchain-based FL (BCFL), spotlighting the synergy between blockchain's security features and FL's privacy-preserving model training capabilities. First, we present the taxonomy of BCFL from three aspects, including decentralized, separate networks, and reputation-based architectures. Then, we summarize the general architecture of BCFL systems, providing a comprehensive perspective on FL architectures informed by blockchain. Afterward, we analyze the application of BCFL in healthcare, IoT, and other privacy-sensitive areas. Finally, we identify future research directions of BCFL. |

Indeed, blockchains such as Ethereum have spent considerable resources addressing this issue and have redesigned the block production process to account for MEV. This paper provides an overview of the MEV problem and tracks how Ethereum has adapted to its presence. A vital aspect of the block building exercise is that it is a variant of the knapsack problem. Consequently, this paper highlights the role of designing auctions to fill a knapsack--or knapsack auctions--in alleviating the MEV problem. Overall, this paper presents a survey of the main issues and an accessible primer for researchers and students wishing to explore the economics of block building and MEV further. |
|**2024-03-27**|**Towards Standardized Regulations for Block Chain Smart Contracts: Insights from Delphi and SWARA Analysis**|Shahin Heidari et.al.|[2403.19051](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19051)| The rise of digital currency and the public ledger Block Chain has led to the development of a new type of electronic contract known as "smart contracts." For these contracts to be considered valid, they must adhere to traditional contract rules and be concluded without any impediments. Once written, encrypted, and signed, smart contracts are recorded in the Block Chain Ledger, providing transparent and secure record-keeping. Smart contracts offer several benefits, including their ability to execute automatically without requiring human intervention, their provision of public visibility of contract provisions on the Block Chain, their avoidance of financial crimes like Money Laundering, and their prevention of contract abuses. However, disputes arising from smart contracts still require human intervention, presenting unique challenges in enforcing these contracts, such as evidentiary issues, enforceability of waivers of defenses, and jurisdictional and choice-of-law considerations. Due to the novel nature of smart contracts, there are currently no standardized regulations that apply to them. Countries that have approved them have turned to customary law to legitimize their use. The Delphi method was used to identify critical success factors for applying blockchain transactions in a manufacturing company. Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was then utilized to determine the most influential factors. The proposed methodology was implemented, and results show that the most influential factors for the successful application of blockchain transactions as smart contracts in a manufacturing company are: turnover, the counter argument, vision, components for building, and system outcome quality. Conversely, connections with government entities and subcontractors, and the guarantee of quality have the least influence on successful implementation. |

The widely recognized HotStuff protocol uses cryptographic measures for efficient view changes and reduced communication complexity.

This paper aims to compare the principles and analyze the effectiveness of both protocols, hoping to depict their key differences and assess the potential enhancements offered by HotStuff-2. |
|**2024-03-26**|**Empirical Analysis of EIP-3675: Miner Dynamics, Transaction Fees, and Transaction Time**|Umesh Bhatt et.al.|[2403.17885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17885)| The Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3675 (EIP-3675) marks a significant shift, transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in a staggering 99.95% decrease in energy consumption. However, the transition prompts two critical questions: (1). How does EIP-3675 affect miners' dynamics? and (2). How do users determine priority fees, considering that paying too little may cause delays or non-inclusion, yet paying too much wastes money with little to no benefits? To address the first question, we present a comprehensive empirical study examining EIP-3675's effect on miner dynamics (i.e., miner participation, distribution, and the degree of randomness in miner selection). Our findings reveal that the transition has encouraged broader participation of miners in block append operation, resulting in a larger pool of unique miners ( $\approx50\times$ PoW), and the change in miner distribution with the increased number of unique small category miners ($\approx60\times$ PoW). However, there is an unintended consequence: a reduction in the miner selection randomness, which signifies the negative impact of the transition to PoS-Ethereum on network decentralization. Regarding the second question, we employed regression-based machine learning models; the Gradient Boosting Regressor performed best in predicting priority fees, while the K-Neighbours Regressor was worst. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Machine Learning on Blockchain Data: A Systematic Mapping Study**|Georgios Palaiokrassas et.al.|[2403.17081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17081)| Context: Blockchain technology has drawn growing attention in the literature and in practice. Blockchain technology generates considerable amounts of data and has thus been a topic of interest for Machine Learning (ML).   Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art on machine learning applied to blockchain data. This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on ML applied to blockchain data. This will allow us to discover the fields where more effort should be placed in future research.   Method: A systematic mapping study has been conducted to identify the relevant literature. Ultimately, 159 articles were selected and classified according to various dimensions, specifically, the domain use case, the blockchain, the data, and the machine learning models.   Results: The majority of the papers (49.7%) fall within the Anomaly use case. Bitcoin (47.2%) was the blockchain that drew the most attention. A dataset consisting of more than 1.000.000 data points was used by 31.4% of the papers. And Classification (46.5%) was the ML task most applied to blockchain data.   Conclusion: The results confirm that ML applied to blockchain data is a relevant and a growing topic of interest both in the literature and in practice. Nevertheless, some open challenges and gaps remain, which can lead to future research directions. Specifically, we identify novel machine learning algorithms, the lack of a standardization framework, blockchain scalability issues and cross-chain interactions as areas worth exploring in the future. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Towards Secure and Trusted-by-Design Smart Contracts**|Zaynah Dargaye et.al.|[2403.16903](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16903)| Distributed immutable ledgers, or blockchains, allow the secure digitization of evidential transactions without relying on a trusted third-party. Evidential transactions involve the exchange of any form of physical evidence, such as money, birth certificate, visas, tickets, etc. Most of the time, evidential transactions occur in the context of complex procedures, called evidential protocols, among physical agents. The blockchain provides the mechanisms to transfer evidence, while smart contracts - programs executing within the blockchain in a decentralized and replicated fashion - allow encoding evidential protocols on top of a blockchain.   As a smart contract foregoes trusted third-parties and runs on several machines anonymously, it constitutes a highly critical program that has to be secure and trusted-by-design. While most of the current smart contract languages focus on easy programmability, they do not directly address the need of guaranteeing trust and accountability, which becomes a significant issue when evidential protocols are encoded as smart contracts. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Formally Verifying the Safety of Pipelined Moonshot Consensus Protocol**|M. Praveen et.al.|[2403.16637](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16637)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a contemporary competitive as well as complementary to traditional centralized finance systems. As of 23rd January 2024, per Defillama approximately USD 55 billion is the total value locked on the DeFi applications on all blockchains put together.   A Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State Machine Replication (SMR) protocol, popularly known as the consensus protocol, is the central component of a blockchain. If forks are possible in a consensus protocol, they can be misused to carry out double spending attacks and can be catastrophic given high volumes of finance that are transacted on blockchains. Formal verification of the safety of consensus protocols is the golden standard for guaranteeing that forks are not possible. However, it is considered complex and challenging to do. This is reflected by the fact that not many complex consensus protocols are formally verified except for Tendermint and QBFT.   We focus on Supra's Pipelined Moonshot consensus protocol. Similar to Tendermint's formal verification, we too model Pipelined Moonshot using IVy and formally prove that for all network sizes, as long as the number of Byzantine validators is less than one thirds, the protocol does not allow forks, thus proving that Pipelined Moonshot is safe and double spending cannot be done using forks. The IVy model and proof of safety is available on Github. |
|**2024-09-14**|**Combining Fine-Tuning and LLM-based Agents for Intuitive Smart Contract Auditing with Justifications**|Wei Ma et.al.|[2403.16073](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16073)| Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum. Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct). This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   In this paper, we propose iAudit, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, iAudit is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, iAudit employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate iAudit, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune iAudit. We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, iAudit achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%. The causes generated by iAudit achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes. |

This study investigates the impact of 2022 World Cup matches on the dynamic performance of each team's fan token. The event study uncovers fan token returns surged six months before the World Cup, driven by positive anticipation effects. However, intraday analysis reveals a reversal of fan token returns consistently declining and trading volumes rising as matches unfold. To explain findings, we uncover asymmetries whereby defeats in high-stake matches caused a plunge in fan token returns, compared to low-stake matches, intensifying in magnitude for knockout matches. Contrarily, victories enhance trading volumes, reflecting increased market activity without a corresponding positive effect on returns. We align findings with the classic market adage "buy the rumor, sell the news," unveiling cognitive biases and nuances in investor sentiment, cautioning the dichotomy of pre-event optimism and subsequent performance declines. |
|**2024-06-12**|**Single-token vs Two-token Blockchain Tokenomics**|Aggelos Kiayias et.al.|[2403.15429](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15429)| We consider long-term equilibria that arise in the tokenomics design of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems that comprise of users and validators, both striving to maximize their own utilities. Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired portion of the system service.   We study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged, (2) decentralization: multiple validators are participating, (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, i.e., it does not require fiat reserves on-chain for buy back of tokens or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings. Our analysis enables to put forward a novel generic mechanism for blockchain ``monetary policy'' that we call {\em quantitative rewarding} (QR). We investigate how to implement QR in single-token and two-token proof of stake (PoS) blockchain systems. The latter are systems that utilize one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded. Our approach demonstrates a concrete advantage of the two-token setting in terms of the ability of the QR mechanism to be realized effectively and provide good equilibria. Our analysis also reveals an inherent limitation of the single token setting in terms of implementing an effective blockchain monetary policy - a distinction that is, to the best of our knowledge, highlighted for the first time. |
|**2024-03-22**|**Blockchain-based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse**|Jiawen Kang et.al.|[2403.15285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15285)| Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs), the Vehicle Twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses. |

This article explores the Metaverse from the perspective of multimedia communication by conducting and analyzing real-world experiments on four different Metaverse platforms: VR (virtual reality) Vircadia, VR Mozilla Hubs, VRChat, and MR (mixed reality) Virtual City. We first investigate the traffic patterns and network performance in the three VR platforms. After raising the challenges of the Metaverse streaming and investigating the potential methods to enhance Metaverse performance, we propose a remote rendering architecture and verify its advantages through a prototype involving the campus network and MR multimodal interaction by comparison with local rendering. |

A growing number of application domains, such as healthcare, utilize these statistics in advancing research and improving patient care.   In this work, we explore the challenge of input validation and public verifiability within privacy-preserving aggregation protocols. We address the scenario in which a party receives data from multiple sources and must verify the validity of the input and correctness of the computations over this data to third parties, such as auditors, while ensuring input data privacy. To achieve this, we propose the "VPAS" protocol, which satisfies these requirements. Our protocol utilizes homomorphic encryption for data privacy, and employs Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and a blockchain system for input validation and public verifiability. We constructed VPAS by extending existing verifiable encryption schemes into secure protocols that enable N clients to encrypt, aggregate, and subsequently release the final result to a collector in a verifiable manner.   We implemented and experimentally evaluated VPAS with regard to encryption costs, proof generation, and verification. The findings indicate that the overhead associated with verifiability in our protocol is 10x lower than that incurred by simply using conventional zkSNARKs. This enhanced efficiency makes it feasible to apply input validation with public verifiability across a wider range of applications or use cases that can tolerate moderate computational overhead associated with proof generation. |
|**2024-10-01**|**Tax Policy Handbook for Crypto Assets**|Arindam Misra et.al.|[2403.15074](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15074)| The Financial system has witnessed rapid technological changes. The rise of Bitcoin and other crypto assets based on Distributed Ledger Technology mark a fundamental change in the way people transact and transmit value over a decentralized network, spread across geographies. This has created regulatory and tax policy blind spots, as governments and tax administrations take time to understand and provide policy responses to this innovative, revolutionary, and fast-paced technology. Due to the breakneck speed of innovation in blockchain technology and advent of Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Metaverse, it is unlikely that the policy interventions and guidance by regulatory authorities or tax administrations would be ahead or in sync with the pace of innovation. This paper tries to explain the principles on which crypto assets function, their underlying technology and relates them to the tax issues and taxable events which arise within this ecosystem. It also provides instances of tax and regulatory policy responses already in effect in various jurisdictions, including the recent changes in reporting standards by the FATF and the OECD. This paper tries to explain the rationale behind existing laws and policies and the challenges in their implementation. It also attempts to present a ballpark estimate of tax potential of this asset class and suggests creation of global public digital infrastructure that can address issues related to pseudonymity and extra-territoriality. The paper analyses both direct and indirect taxation issues related to crypto assets and discusses more recent aspects like proof-of-stake and maximal extractable value in greater detail. |

However, all of them, except for the random rule, require major updates, rely on a trusted third party, or assume strong synchrony. Hence, it is challenging to apply these methods to existing systems such as Bitcoin.   To address these issues, we propose another countermeasure that can be easily applied to existing proof of work blockchain systems. Our method is a tie-breaking rule that uses partial proof of work, which does not function as a block, as a time standard with finer granularity. By using the characteristic of partial proof of work, the proposed method enables miners to choose the last-generated block in a chain tie, which suppresses intentional forks by attackers. Only weak synchrony, which is already met by existing systems such as Bitcoin, is required for effective functioning.   We evaluated the proposed method through a detailed analysis that is lacking in existing works. In networks that adopt our method, the proportion of the attacker hashrate necessary for selfish mining was approximately 0.31479 or higher, regardless of the block propagation capability of the attacker. Furthermore, we demonstrated through extended selfish mining that the impact of Match against pre-generated block, which is a concern in all last-generated rules, can be mitigated with appropriate parameter settings. |

|**2024-04-03**|**Global, robust and comparable digital carbon assets**|Sadiq Jaffer et.al.|[2403.14581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14581)| Carbon credits purchased in the voluntary carbon market allow unavoidable emissions, such as from international flights for essential travel, to be offset by an equivalent climate benefit, such as avoiding emissions from tropical deforestation. However, many concerns regarding the credibility of these offsetting claims have been raised. Moreover, the credit market is manual, therefore inefficient and unscalable, and non-fungible, therefore illiquid. To address these issues, we propose an efficient digital methodology that combines remote sensing data, modern econometric techniques, and on-chain certification and trading to create a new digital carbon asset (the PACT stablecoin) against which carbon offsetting claims can be transparently verified. PACT stablecoins are produced as outputs from a reproducible computational pipeline for estimating the climate benefits of carbon offset projects that not only quantifies the CO2 emissions involved, but also allows for similar credits to be pooled based on their co-benefits such as biodiversity and jurisdictional attributes, increasing liquidity through fungibility within pools. We implement and evaluate the PACT carbon stablecoin on the Tezos blockchain, which is designed to facilitate low-cost transactions while minimizing environmental impact. Our implementation includes a contract for a registry for tracking issuance, ownership, and retirement of credits, and a custodian contract to bridge on-chain and off-chain transactions. Our work brings scale and trust to the voluntary carbon market by providing a transparent, scalable, and efficient framework for high integrity carbon credit transactions. |

Building upon concepts such as adversarial assumptions, goals, and capabilities, our proposed adversary model classifies and constrains the use of adversarial actions based on classical distributed system models, defined by both failure and communication models. The objective is to study the effects of these allowed actions on the properties of distributed protocols under various system models. A significant aspect of our research involves integrating this adversary model into the Multi-Agent eXperimenter (MAX) framework. This integration enables fine-grained simulations of adversarial attacks on blockchain networks. In this paper, we particularly study four distinct fairness properties on Hyperledger Fabric with the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Tendermint consensus algorithm being selected for its ordering service. We define novel attacks that combine adversarial actions on both protocols, with the aim of violating a specific client-fairness property. Simulations confirm our ability to violate this property and allow us to evaluate the impact of these attacks on several order-fairness properties that relate orders of transaction reception and delivery. |

Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS).   Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns. Our thorough review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks of tasks on LLM4BS, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. |
|**2024-03-20**|**Statistical Confidence in Mining Power Estimates for PoW Blockchains**|Mary Milad et.al.|[2403.13736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13736)| The security of blockchain systems depends on the distribution of mining power across participants. If sufficient mining power is controlled by one entity, they can force their own version of events. This may allow them to double spend coins, for example. For Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, however, the distribution of mining power cannot be read directly from the blockchain and must instead be inferred from the number of blocks mined in a specific sample window. We introduce a framework to quantify this statistical uncertainty for the Nakamoto coefficient, which is a commonly-used measure of blockchain decentralization. We show that aggregating blocks over a day can lead to considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin failing more than half the hypothesis tests ({\alpha} = 0.05) when using a daily granularity. For these reasons, we recommend that blocks are aggregated over a sample window of at least 7 days. Instead of reporting a single value, our approach produces a range of possible Nakamoto coefficient values that have statistical support at a particular significance level {\alpha}. |

Inthis work, we propose a specification mining approach to infer contract specifications from past transactionhistories. Our approach derives high-level behavioral automata of function invocations, accompanied byprogram invariants statistically inferred from the transaction histories. We implemented our approach as toolSmConand evaluated it on eleven well-studied Azure benchmark smart contracts and six popular real-worldDApp smart contracts. The experiments show thatSmConmines reasonably accurate specifications that canbe used to facilitate DApp understanding and development in terms of document maintenance and test suite improvement. |

Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of block to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing mechanisms. |

|**2024-08-25**|**Optimal AoI-based Block Propagation and Incentive Mechanism for Blockchain Networks in Web 3.0**|Jinbo Wen et.al.|[2403.12807](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12807)| Web 3.0 is regarded as a revolutionary paradigm that enables users to securely manage data without a centralized authority. Blockchains, which enable data to be managed in a decentralized and transparent manner, are key technologies for achieving Web 3.0 goals. However, Web 3.0 based on blockchains is still in its infancy, such as ensuring block freshness and optimizing block propagation for improving blockchain performance. In this paper, we develop a freshness-aware block propagation optimization framework for Web 3.0. We first propose a novel metric called Age of Block Information (AoBI) based on the concept of age of information to quantify block freshness. AoBI measures the time elapsed from the freshest transaction generation to the completion of block consensus. To make block propagation optimization tractable, we classify miners into five different states and propose a block propagation model for public blockchains inspired by epidemic models. Moreover, considering that the miners are bounded rational, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game for block propagation to improve block propagation efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with other block propagation mechanisms in public blockchains, the proposed scheme has a higher block forwarding probability, which improves block propagation efficiency and decreases the minimum value of average AoBI. |

However, this growth has also led to a largely unexplored aspect: their security vulnerabilities. As the ecosystem that includes both offline and online models, various tools, browser plugins, and third-party applications continues to expand, it significantly widens the attack surface, thereby escalating the potential for security breaches. These expansions in the 6G and beyond landscape provide new avenues for adversaries to manipulate LLMs for malicious purposes. We focus on the security aspects of LLMs from the viewpoint of potential adversaries. We aim to dissect their objectives and methodologies, providing an in-depth analysis of known security weaknesses. This will include the development of a comprehensive threat taxonomy, categorizing various adversary behaviors. Also, our research will concentrate on how LLMs can be integrated into cybersecurity efforts by defense teams, also known as blue teams. We will explore the potential synergy between LLMs and blockchain technology, and how this combination could lead to the development of next-generation, fully autonomous security solutions. This approach aims to establish a unified cybersecurity strategy across the entire computing continuum, enhancing overall digital security infrastructure. |
|**2024-03-18**|**Demystifying the DAO Governance Process**|Junjie Ma et.al.|[2403.11758](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11758)| Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) becomes a popular governance solution for decentralized applications (dApps) to achieve decentralized governance. In the DAO, no single entity can arbitrarily control the dApps without approval from the majority of members. However, despite its advantages, DAO has also been targeted by several attacks, leading to the loss of millions of dollars. In this paper, we first provided an overview of the DAO governance process within the blockchain. Next, we identified the issues within three components of governance process: Governance Contract, Documentation, and Proposal. Each of these components is vulnerable to issues that could potentially result in substantial financial losses. Then we developed automated methods to detected above issues. To investigate the issues within the existing DAO ecosystem, we constructed a state-of-the-art dataset that includes 16,427 DAOs, 183 documentation, and 122,307 proposals across 9 different blockchains. Our analysis reveals that a majority of DAO developers and members have not given sufficient attention to these issues, especially in the area of proposal. The result shows that over 60% of the examined proposals fail to provide a consistent description and code for their members, highlighting a significant gap in ensuring transparency within the DAO governance process. For a better DAO governance ecosystem, DAO developers and members can utilize the methods to identify and address issues within governance process. |

It is known for its efficiency and is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Tangle can be configured by utilizing the tip selection process. Due to performance issues with light nodes, full nodes are being asked to perform the tip selections of light nodes. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that tip selection can be exploited to compromise users' privacy. An adversary full node can associate a transaction with the identity of a light node by comparing the light node's request with its ledger. We show that these types of attacks are not only viable in the current IOTA environment but also in IOTA 2.0 and the privacy improvement being studied. We also provide solutions to mitigate these attacks and propose ways to enhance anonymity in the IOTA network while maintaining efficiency and scalability. |

Although Solana has only begun to gain popularity in recent years, its NFT market has seen substantial transaction volumes. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic research on the characteristics of Solana NFTs from two perspectives: longitudinal measurement and wash trading security audit. We gathered 132,736 Solana NFT from Solscan and analyzed the sales data within these collections. Investigating users' economic activity and NFT owner information reveals that the top users in Solana NFT are skewed toward a higher distribution of purchases. Subsequently, we employ the Local Outlier Factor algorithm to conduct a wash trading audit on 2,175 popular Solana NFTs. We discovered that 138 NFT pools are involved in wash trading, with 8 of these NFTs having a wash trading rate exceeding 50%. Fortunately, none of these NFTs have been entirely washed out. |

CheckMate applies automated reasoning techniques to determine whether a game-theoretic protocol model is game-theoretically secure, that is, Byzantine fault tolerant and incentive compatible.

LSTs are tokenized representations of staked assets on proof-of-stake blockchains. First, we model LST-liquidity on AMMs theoretically, categorizing suitable AMM types for LST liquidity and deriving formulas for the necessary returns from trading fees to adequately compensate liquidity providers under the particular price trajectories of LSTs. For the latter, two relevant metrics are considered: (1) losses compared to holding the liquidity outside the AMM (loss-versus-holding, or "impermanent loss"), and (2) the relative profitability compared to fully staking the capital (loss-versus-staking) which is specifically tailored to the case of LST-liquidity. Next, we empirically measure these metrics for Ethereum LSTs across the most relevant AMM pools. We find that, while trading fees often compensate for impermanent loss, fully staking is more profitable for many pools, raising questions about the sustainability of the current LST liquidity allocation to AMMs. |

However, the excessive installation and lack of recycling facilities pose environmental risks. This paper suggests a circular economy approach to address the issue. By implementing blockchain technology, the end-of-life (EOL) of solar panels can be tracked, and responsibilities can be assigned to relevant stakeholders. The degradation of panels can be monetized by tracking users' energy-related activities, and these funds can be used for future recycling. A new coin, the recycling coin (RC-Coin), incentivizes solar panel recycling and utilizes decentralized finance to stabilize the coin price and supply issue. |
|**2024-10-24**|**How To Save Fees in Bitcoin Smart Contracts: a Simple Optimistic Off-chain Protocol**|Dario Maddaloni et.al.|[2403.09880](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09880)| We consider the execution of smart contracts on Bitcoin. There, every contract step corresponds to appending to the blockchain a new transaction that spends the output representing the old contract state, creating a new one for the updated state. This standard procedure requires the contract participants to pay transaction fees for every execution step. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that moves most of the execution of a Bitcoin contract off-chain. When all participants follow this protocol, they are able to save on transaction fees, drastically reducing them. By contrast, whenever adversaries try to disrupt the off-chain execution, any honest participant is still able to enforce the correct contract behaviour, by continuing its execution on-chain. |

Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios. |
|**2024-08-20**|**Efficient Signature-Free Validated Agreement**|Pierre Civit et.al.|[2403.08374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08374)| Byzantine agreement enables n processes to agree on a common L-bit value, despite up to t > 0 arbitrary failures. A long line of work has been dedicated to improving the bit complexity of Byzantine agreement in synchrony. This has culminated in COOL, an error-free (deterministically secure against a computationally unbounded adversary) solution that achieves O(nL + n^2 logn) worst-case bit complexity (which is optimal for L >= n logn according to the Dolev-Reischuk lower bound). COOL satisfies strong unanimity: if all correct processes propose the same value, only that value can be decided. Strong unanimity is, however, not sufficient for today's state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain protocols. These systems value progress and require a decided value to always be valid, excluding default decisions (such as EMPTY) even in cases where there is no unanimity a priori. Validated Byzantine agreement satisfies this property (called external validity). Yet, the best error-free (or even signature-free) validated agreement solutions achieve only O(n^2L) bit complexity, a far cry from the Omega(nL + n^2) Dolev-Reishcuk lower bound. In this paper, we present two new synchronous algorithms for validated Byzantine agreement, HashExt and ErrorFreeExt, with different trade-offs. Both algorithms are (1) signature-free, (2) optimally resilient (tolerate up to t < n / 3 failures), and (3) early-stopping (terminate in O(f+1) rounds, where f <= t is the actual number of failures). On the one hand, HashExt uses only hashes and achieves O(nL + n^3 kappa) bit complexity, which is optimal for L >= n^2 kappa (where kappa is the size of a hash). On the other hand, ErrorFreeExt is error-free, using no cryptography whatsoever, and achieves O( (nL + n^2) logn ) bit complexity, which is near-optimal for any L. |

However, to be considered masterpieces, they must be maintained in pristine condition or restored according to strict guidelines applied by expert services. Therefore, all data about restoration processes and other relevant information about these vehicles must be rigorously documented to ensure their verifiability and immutability. Here, we report on our ongoing research to adequately provide such capabilities to the classic car ecosystem.   Using a design science research approach, we have developed a blockchain-based solution using Hyperledger Fabric that facilitates the proper recording of classic car information, restoration procedures applied, and all related documentation by ensuring that this data is immutable and trustworthy while promoting collaboration between interested parties. This solution was validated and received positive feedback from various entities in the classic car sector. The enhanced and secured documentation is expected to contribute to the digital transformation of the classic car sector, promote authenticity and trustworthiness, and ultimately increase the market value of classic cars. |

An electronic healthcare system that checks patient data, prepares medicines and provides financial assistance is necessary. Providing safe data transmission, monitoring, decentralization, preserving patient privacy, and maintaining confidentiality are essential to an electronic healthcare system. In this study, we introduce (SCALHEALTH) which is a blockchain-based scheme of the Hyperledger Fabric consortium. In this study, we use authentication to agree on a common key for data encryption to send data confidentially. Also, sending data through IPFS is decentralized. Non-fungible token (NFT) is used to send patient prescriptions to pharmacies and insurance companies to ensure the authenticity of patient prescriptions. As the system's main body, blockchain creates authorization and validation for all devices and institutions. Also, all metadata in the system is recorded on the blockchain to maintain integrity, transparency, and timely data monitoring. The proposed study uses two types of blockchain: a health blockchain and a financial blockchain. The financial blockchain is for financial transactions and is based on Ethereum. The health blockchain also introduces a mechanism that allows several blockchains to be active in parallel, instead of only one blockchain. The prototype of this mechanism is simulated in two scenarios. In comparison to the normal state, the proposed plan has superior results. |

The Blockchain network validates such transactions, storing them into sequential blocks of which integrity is ensured. Smart Contracts deal with value stakes, if a damaging transaction is validated, it may never be reverted, leading to unrecoverable losses. To prevent this, security aspects have been explored in several fields, with research providing catalogs of security defects, secure code recommendations, and possible solutions to fix vulnerabilities. In our study, we refer to vulnerability fixing in the ways found in the literature as guidelines. However, it is not clear to what extent developers adhere to these guidelines, nor whether there are other viable common solutions and what they are. The goal of our research is to fill knowledge gaps related to developers' observance of existing guidelines and to propose new and viable solutions to security vulnerabilities. To reach our goal, we will obtain from Solidity GitHub repositories the commits that fix vulnerabilities included in the DASP TOP 10 and we will conduct a manual analysis of fixing approaches employed by developers. Our analysis aims to determine the extent to which literature-based fixing strategies are followed. Additionally, we will identify and discuss emerging fixing techniques not currently documented in the literature. Through qualitative analysis, we will evaluate the suitability of these new fixing solutions and discriminate between valid approaches and potential mistakes. |

Today, there are multiple blockchains with differing interfaces and security properties. Programming in this multi-blockchain world is hindered by the lack of general and convenient abstractions for cross-chain communication and computation. Current cross-chain communication bridges have varied and low-level interfaces, making it difficult to develop portable applications. Current methods for multi-chain atomic transactions are limited in scope to cryptocurrency swaps.   This work addresses these issues. We first define a uniform, high-level interface for communication between chains. Building on this interface, we formulate a protocol that guarantees atomicity for general transactions whose operations may span several chains. We formulate and prove the desired correctness and security properties of these protocols. Our prototype implementation is built using the LayerZero cross-chain bridge. Experience with this implementation shows that the new abstractions considerably simplify the design and implementation of multi-chain transactions. Experimental evaluation with multi-chain swap transactions demonstrates performance comparable to that of custom-built implementations. |

With its inherent benefits of decentralization and anonymization, blockchain has gained considerable attention in developing covert channels. To guarantee a highly secure covert channel, channel negotiation should be contactless before the communication, carrier transaction features must be indistinguishable from normal transactions during the communication, and communication identities must be untraceable after the communication. Such a full-lifecycle covert channel is indispensable to defend against a versatile adversary who intercepts two communicating parties comprehensively (e.g., on-chain and off-chain). Unfortunately, it has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. We make the first effort to achieve a full-lifecycle covert channel, a novel blockchain-based covert channel named ABC-Channel. We tackle a series of challenges, such as off-chain contact dependency, increased masquerading difficulties as growing transaction volume, and time-evolving, communicable yet untraceable identities, to achieve contactless channel negotiation, indistinguishable transaction features, and untraceable communication identities, respectively. We develop a working prototype to validate ABC-Channel and conduct extensive tests on the Bitcoin testnet. The experimental results demonstrate that ABC-Channel achieves substantially secure covert capabilities. In comparison to existing methods, it also exhibits state-of-the-art transmission efficiency. |

However, to advance AI R&D, two challenges arise: 1) significant data imbalance, with most data from Europe/America and under 10% from Asia, despite its 60% global population share; and 2) hefty time and investment needed to curate proprietary datasets for commercial use. In response, we established the first commercial medical imaging platform, encompassing steps like: 1) data collection, 2) data selection, 3) annotation, and 4) pre-processing. Moreover, we focus on harnessing under-represented data from Japan and broader Asia, including Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Whole Slide Imaging scans. Using the collected data, we are preparing/providing ready-to-use datasets for medical AI R&D by 1) offering these datasets to AI firms, biopharma, and medical device makers and 2) using them as training/test data to develop tailored AI solutions for such entities. We also aim to merge Blockchain for data security and plan to synthesize rare disease data via generative AI. DataHub Website: https://medical-datahub.ai/ |

Nazari et.al.|[2403.06112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06112)| This paper introduces peer to peer (P2P) trading mechanisms based on decentralized Blockchain to facilitate retail electricity market for ever-increasing distributed energy resources (DERs). The Blockchain network supports fast and secure retail trading among DERs and facilitates a sustainable local P2P trading platform. In this decentralized Blockchain architecture no single entity or organization has control over the entire system rather all users collectively maintain control. The effectiveness of the proposed automated market design and optimization is simulated using different use case scenarios in an open source Blockchain Simulator and MATLAB. The results show the efficacy of the trading mechanism in achieving demand response through strategies such as peak load shaving, load shifting, and integration of DERs. |

This paper presents "SecureRights," an innovative Blockchain-based Trusted Digital Rights Management (DRM) framework. It strengthens the defence against unauthorized use and streamlines the claim of digital rights. Utilizing blockchain, digital watermarking, perceptual hashing, Quick Response (QR) codes, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), SecureRights securely stores watermark information on the blockchain with timestamp authentication. Incorporating perceptual hashing generates robust hash tokens based on image structure. The addition of QR codes enhances the watermarking, offering a comprehensive solution for resilient intellectual property rights protection. Rigorous evaluations affirm SecureRights' resilience against various attacks, establishing its efficacy in safeguarding digital content and simplifying rightful ownership assertion. |

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) looks promising for enhancing performance and reducing costs by offloading the computing work of IoT to MEC servers. However, the current methods for offloading have issues with privacy and security during the transfer of data and programs. To tackle this, recent developments have introduced secure offloading methods using Blockchain technology, which helps to make MEC more secure by building trust between nodes, improving how edges are authenticated and accessed, and stopping unauthorized access to devices. This paper reviews these Blockchain-based offloading methods for different MEC settings. It starts by explaining the key ideas in offloading and Blockchain, then it sorts the Blockchain-based offloading methods by the algorithms they use. It also compares the offloading methods in each group and ends with a discussion and comparison of the different techniques, tools, and metrics used in these methods. |

Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs. |
|**2024-03-05**|**Enhancing Security in Federated Learning through Adaptive Consensus-Based Model Update Validation**|Zahir Alsulaimawi et.al.|[2403.04803](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04803)| This paper introduces an advanced approach for fortifying Federated Learning (FL) systems against label-flipping attacks. We propose a simplified consensus-based verification process integrated with an adaptive thresholding mechanism. This dynamic thresholding is designed to adjust based on the evolving landscape of model updates, offering a refined layer of anomaly detection that aligns with the real-time needs of distributed learning environments. Our method necessitates a majority consensus among participating clients to validate updates, ensuring that only vetted and consensual modifications are applied to the global model. The efficacy of our approach is validated through experiments on two benchmark datasets in deep learning, CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Our results indicate a significant mitigation of label-flipping attacks, bolstering the FL system's resilience. This method transcends conventional techniques that depend on anomaly detection or statistical validation by incorporating a verification layer reminiscent of blockchain's participatory validation without the associated cryptographic overhead. The innovation of our approach rests in striking an optimal balance between heightened security measures and the inherent limitations of FL systems, such as computational efficiency and data privacy. Implementing a consensus mechanism specifically tailored for FL environments paves the way for more secure, robust, and trustworthy distributed machine learning applications, where safeguarding data integrity and model robustness is critical. |

However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms. |
|**2024-03-02**|**Towards Trust and Reputation as a Service in a Blockchain-based Decentralized Marketplace**|Stephen Olariu et.al.|[2403.04779](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04779)| Motivated by the challenges inherent in implementing trusted services in the Society 5.0 initiative, we propose a novel trust and reputation service for a decentralized marketplace. We assume that a Smart Contract is associated with each transaction and that the Smart Contract is responsible for providing automatic feedback, replacing notoriously unreliable buyer feedback by a more objective assessment of how well the parties have fulfilled their obligations. Our trust and reputation service was inspired by Laplace Law of Succession, where trust in a seller is defined as the probability that she will fulfill her obligations on the next transaction. We offer three applications. First, we discuss an application to a multi-segment marketplace, where a malicious seller may establish a stellar reputation by selling cheap items, only to use their excellent reputation to defraud buyers in a different market segment. Next, we demonstrate how our trust and reputation service works in the context of sellers with time-varying performance by providing two discounting schemes wherein older reputation scores are given less weight than more recent ones. Finally, we show how to predict trust and reputation far in the future, based on incomplete information. Extensive simulations have confirmed our analytical results. |
|**2024-03-07**|**Collaborative Cybersecurity Using Blockchain: A Survey**|Loïc Miller et.al.|[2403.04410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04410)| Collaborative cybersecurity relies on organizations sharing information to boost security, but trust management is a key concern. Decentralized solutions like distributed ledgers, particularly blockchain, are crucial for eliminating single points of failure. However, the existing literature on blockchain-based collaborative cybersecurity is limited, lacking comprehensive insights. This paper addresses this gap by surveying blockchain's role in collaborative cybersecurity from 2016 to 2023. It explores various applications, trends, and the evolution of blockchain technology, focusing on access control, data validation policies, underlying tech, and consensus mechanisms. A key finding is the fragmentation of the field with no dominant research group or venue. Many recent projects poorly select consensus protocols for their blockchain. To aid researchers and practitioners, this paper offers guidelines for choosing the right blockchain for specific purposes and highlights open research areas and lessons learned from past blockchain applications in collaborative cybersecurity, encouraging further exploration in this field. |
|**2024-03-14**|**On HTLC-Based Protocols for Multi-Party Cross-Chain Swaps**|Emily Clark et.al.|[2403.03906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03906)| In his 2018 paper, Herlihy introduced an atomic protocol for multi-party asset swaps across different blockchains. His model represents an asset swap by a directed graph whose nodes are the participating parties and edges represent asset transfers, and rational behavior of the participants is captured by a preference relation between a protocol's outcomes. Asset transfers between parties are achieved using smart contracts. These smart contracts are quite involved and they require storage and processing of a large number of paths in the swap digraph, limiting practical significance of his protocol. His paper also describes a different protocol that uses only standard hash time-lock contracts (HTLC's), but this simpler protocol applies only to some special types of digraphs. He left open the question whether there is a simple and efficient protocol for cross-chain asset swaps in arbitrary digraphs. Motivated by this open problem, we conducted a comprehensive study of \emph{HTLC-based protocols}, in which all asset transfers are implemented with HTLCs. Our main contribution is a full characterization of swap digraphs that have such protocols. |

This is essential to ensure that the momentum of this trend translates into tangible outcomes, thwarting phenomena like greenwashing and upholding high standards of integrity, all while expediting progress through automation. This paper focuses specifically on carbon markets, which, after enduring years of confusion and controversy, may finally be on the brink of converging toward internationally recognized minimum standards. Beginning with an introduction to fundamental concepts pertaining to carbon markets and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), the paper proceeds to dissect the challenges and opportunities within this burgeoning field. Its primary contribution lies in offering a comprehensive overview of recent developments across various initiatives (such as ICVCM, IETA/WorldBank/CAD Trust, IEEE/ISO) and providing a layered analysis of the entire ecosystem. This framework aids in understanding and prioritising future endeavours. Ultimately, the paper furnishes a set of recommendations aimed at bolstering scalability and fostering widespread adoption of best practices within international markets. |
|**2024-09-12**|**Kronos: A Secure and Generic Sharding Blockchain Consensus with Optimized Overhead**|Yizhong Liu et.al.|[2403.03655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03655)| Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by dividing the network into shards, each managing specific unspent transaction outputs or accounts. As an introduced new transaction type, cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of a generic sharding consensus pattern that achieves both security and low overhead. In this paper, we present Kronos, a secure sharding blockchain consensus achieving optimized overhead. In particular, we propose a new secure sharding consensus pattern, based on a buffer managed jointly by shard members. Valid transactions are transferred to the payee via the buffer, while invalid ones are rejected through happy or unhappy paths. Kronos is proved to achieve security with atomicity under malicious clients with optimal intra-shard overhead $kB$ ($k$ for involved shard number and $B$ for a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) cost). Besides, we propose secure cross-shard certification methods based on batch certification and reliable cross-shard transfer. The former combines hybrid trees or vector commitments, while the latter integrates erasure coding. Handling $b$ transactions, Kronos is proved to achieve reliability with low cross-shard overhead $O(n b \lambda)$ ($n$ for shard size and $\lambda$ for the security parameter). Notably, Kronos imposes no restrictions on BFT and does not rely on time assumptions, offering optional constructions in various modules. We implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: asynchronous Speeding Dumbo and partial synchronous Hotstuff. Extensive experiments demonstrate Kronos scales the consensus nodes to thousands, achieving a substantial throughput of 320 ktx/sec with 2.0 sec latency. Compared with the past solutions, Kronos outperforms, achieving up to a 12* improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency. |

This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM. |

|**2024-03-06**|**An Analysis of Intent-Based Markets**|Tarun Chitra et.al.|[2403.02525](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02525)| Mechanisms for decentralized finance on blockchains suffer from various problems, including suboptimal price execution for users, latency, and a worse user experience compared to their centralized counterparts. Recently, off-chain marketplaces, colloquially called `intent markets,' have been proposed as a solution to these problems. In these markets, agents called \emph{solvers} compete to satisfy user orders, which may include complicated user-specified conditions. We provide two formal models of solvers' strategic behavior: one probabilistic and another deterministic. In our first model, solvers initially pay upfront costs to enter a Dutch auction to fill the user's order and then exert congestive, costly effort to search for prices for the user. Our results show that the costs incurred by solvers result in restricted entry in the market. Further, in the presence of costly effort and congestion, our results counter-intuitively show that a planner who aims to maximize user welfare may actually prefer to restrict entry, resulting in limited oligopoly. We then introduce an alternative, optimization-based deterministic model which corroborates these results. We conclude with extensions of our model to other auctions within blockchains and non-cryptocurrency applications, such as the US SEC's Proposal 615. |

Unlike previous studies focusing on the binary relationship between a paper and the concept it attributes to technology, our approach utilizes attribution scores to enhance the relationships between research papers, combining keywords, citation rates, and collaboration status with specific technological concepts. The proposed method integrates text mining and bibliometric analyses to formulate and predict technological proximity indices for encryption technologies using the "OpenAlex" catalog. Our case study findings highlight a significant convergence between blockchain and public-key cryptography, evidenced by the increasing proximity indices. These results offer valuable strategic insights for those contemplating investments in these domains. |

As of March 2023, the estimated global cryptocurrency market cap has reached approximately $949 billion. However, security incidents continue to plague the DeFi ecosystem, and one of the most notorious examples is the ``Rug Pull" scam. This type of cryptocurrency scam occurs when the developer of a particular token project intentionally abandons the project and disappears with investors' funds. Despite it only emerging in recent years, Rug Pull events have already caused significant financial losses. In this work, we manually collected and analyzed 103 real-world rug pull events, categorizing them based on their scam methods. Two primary categories were identified: Contract-related Rug Pull (through malicious functions in smart contracts) and Transaction-related Rug Pull (through cryptocurrency trading without utilizing malicious functions). Based on the analysis of rug pull events, we propose CRPWarner (short for Contract-related Rug Pull Risk Warner) to identify malicious functions in smart contracts and issue warnings regarding potential rug pulls. We evaluated CRPWarner on 69 open-source smart contracts related to rug pull events and achieved a 91.8% precision, 85.9% recall and 88.7% F1-score. Additionally, when evaluating CRPWarner on 13,484 real token contracts on Ethereum, it successfully detected 4168 smart contracts with malicious functions, including zero-day examples. The precision of large-scale experiment reach 84.9%. |

This paper delves into the unique challenges and solutions associated with securing blockchain-based IoT systems, with a specific focus on anonymous auditing to reinforce privacy and security. We propose a novel framework that combines the decentralized nature of blockchain with advanced security protocols tailored for IoT contexts. Central to our approach is the implementation of anonymization techniques in auditing processes, ensuring user privacy while maintaining the integrity and transparency of blockchain transactions. We outline the architecture of blockchain in IoT environments, emphasizing the workflow and specific security mechanisms employed. Additionally, we introduce a security protocol that integrates privacy-enhancing tools and anonymous auditing methods, including the use of advanced cryptographic techniques for anonymity. This study also includes a comparative analysis of our proposed framework against existing models in the domain. Our work aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for enhancing security and privacy in blockchain-based IoT environments, paving the way for more secure and private digital ecosystems. |

While effective at preserving privacy, FL systems face limitations such as single points of failure, lack of incentives, and inadequate security. To address these challenges, blockchain technology is integrated into FL systems to provide stronger security, fairness, and scalability. However, blockchain-empowered FL (BC-FL) systems introduce additional demands on network, computing, and storage resources. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research on BC-FL systems, analyzing the benefits and challenges associated with blockchain integration. We explore why blockchain is applicable to FL, how it can be implemented, and the challenges and existing solutions for its integration. Additionally, we offer insights on future research directions for the BC-FL system. |

However, it is often impractical and resource-consuming to study such a vast number of entities. Consequently, entity clustering serves as an initial step in most analytical studies. This process often employs heuristics grounded in the practices and behaviors of these entities. In this research, we delve into the examination of two widely used heuristics, alongside the introduction of four novel ones. Our contribution includes the introduction of the \textit{clustering ratio}, a metric designed to quantify the reduction in the number of entities achieved by a given heuristic. The assessment of this reduction ratio plays an important role in justifying the selection of a specific heuristic for analytical purposes. Given the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin system, characterized by a continuous increase in the number of entities on the blockchain, and the evolving behaviors of these entities, we extend our study to explore the temporal evolution of the clustering ratio for each heuristic. This temporal analysis enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of these heuristics over time. |

This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by proposing the adaptive restructuring of Merkle and Verkle trees, fundamental components of blockchain architecture responsible for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient verification processes. Unlike traditional static tree structures, our adaptive model dynamically adjusts the configuration of these trees based on usage patterns, significantly reducing the average path length required for verification and, consequently, the computational overhead associated with these processes. Through a comprehensive conceptual framework, we delineate the methodology for adaptive restructuring, encompassing both binary and non-binary tree configurations. This framework is validated through a series of detailed examples, demonstrating the practical feasibility and the efficiency gains achievable with our approach. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis with existing scalability solutions, highlighting the unique advantages of adaptive restructuring in terms of simplicity, security, and efficiency enhancement without introducing additional complexities or dependencies. This study's implications extend beyond theoretical advancements, offering a scalable, secure, and efficient method for blockchain data verification that could facilitate broader adoption of blockchain technology in finance, supply chain management, and beyond. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, the principles and methodologies outlined herein are poised to contribute significantly to its growth and maturity. |

In contrast to the underlying blockchains, the bridges often provide inferior security guarantees and have been targets of hacks causing damage in the range of 1.5 to 2 billion USD in 2022. The current state of bridge architectures is that they are ambiguous, and there is next to no notion of how different architectures and their components are related to different vulnerabilities. Throughout this study, we have analysed 60 different bridges and 34 bridge exploits in the last three years (2021-2023). Our analyses identified 13 architectural components of the bridges. We linked the components to eight types of vulnerabilities, also called design flaws. We identified prevention measures and proposed 11 impact reduction measures based on the existing and possible countermeasures to address the imminent exploits of the design flaws. The results are meant to be used as guidelines for designing and implementing secure cross-chain bridge architectures, preventing design flaws, and mitigating the negative impacts of exploits. |

However, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the requirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce differential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly deteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based Decentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic encryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly aggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to get rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new concept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model performance. Moreover, the proposed AerisAI also provides the broadcast-aware group key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level agreements. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed AerisAI as well as the functionality comparison with the other baselines. We also conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that our proposed AerisAI significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art baselines. |

The innovation in crypto space is often compared to the impact internet had on human life. There is a new term called Web 3.0 for denoting all new computing innovations arising due to the blockchain technologies. Blockchain has emerged as one of the most important inventions of the last decade with crypto currencies or financial use case as one of the domains which progressed most in the last 10 years. It is very important to research about Web 3 technologies, how it is connected to crypto economy and what to expect in this field for the next several decades. |

It offers a detailed overview of the counterfeit token fraud process, along with a systematic summary of characteristics associated with such fraudulent activities observed in Uniswap. The study primarily examines the relationship between revenue from counterfeit token scams and their defining characteristics, and analyzes the influence of market economic factors such as return on market capitalization and price return on Ethereum. Key findings include a significant increase in overall transactions of counterfeit tokens on their first day of fraud, and a rise in upfront fraud costs leading to corresponding increases in revenue. Furthermore, a negative correlation is identified between the total revenue of counterfeit tokens and the volatility of Ethereum market capitalization return, while price return volatility on Ethereum is found to have a positive impact on counterfeit token revenue, albeit requiring further investigation for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the number of subscribers for the real token correlates positively with the realized volume of scam tokens, indicating that a larger community following the legitimate token may inadvertently contribute to the visibility and success of counterfeit tokens. Conversely, the number of Telegram subscribers exhibits a negative impact on the realized volume of scam tokens, suggesting that a higher level of scrutiny or awareness within Telegram communities may act as a deterrent to fraudulent activities. Finally, the timing of when the scam token is introduced on the Ethereum blockchain may have a negative impact on its success. Notably, the cumulative amount scammed by only 42 counterfeit tokens amounted to almost 11214 Ether. |
|**2024-07-15**|**Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability: Applications to prophet inequalities & transaction fee mechanism design**|Aadityan Ganesh et.al.|[2402.19292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292)| This paper studies the fundamental limits of availability and throughput for independent and heterogeneous demands of a limited resource. Availability is the probability that the demands are below the capacity of the resource. Throughput is the expected fraction of the resource that is utilized by the demands. We offer a concentration inequality generator that gives lower bounds on feasible availability and throughput pairs with a given capacity and independent but not necessarily identical distributions of up-to-unit demands. We show that availability and throughput cannot both be poor. These bounds are analogous to tail inequalities on sums of independent random variables, but hold throughout the support of the demand distribution. This analysis gives analytically tractable bounds supporting the unit-demand characterization of Chawla, Devanur, and Lykouris (2023) and generalizes to up-to-unit demands. Our bounds also provide an approach towards improved multi-unit prophet inequalities (Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, and Sandholm, 2007). They have applications to transaction fee mechanism design (for blockchains) where high availability limits the probability of profitable user-miner coalitions (Chung and Shi, 2023). |

Performance evaluation and prediction are crucial in achieving this objective, with performance modeling as a key solution despite the complexities involved in assessing these blockchains. This survey examines prior research concerning the performance modeling blockchain systems, specifically focusing on public permissionless blockchains. Initially, it provides foundational knowledge about these blockchains and the crucial performance parameters for their assessment. Additionally, the study delves into research on the performance modeling of public permissionless blockchains, predominantly considering these systems as bulk service queues. It also examines prior studies on workload and traffic modeling, characterization, and analysis within these blockchain networks. By analyzing existing research, our survey aims to provide insights and recommendations for researchers keen on enhancing the performance of public permissionless blockchains or devising novel mechanisms in this domain. |

This paper presents an DLT-based architectural pattern and technology solution known as SmartQC that aims to provide an extensible and flexible approach to integrating DLT technology into existing workflows and processes. SmartQC offers an opportunity to make processes more time efficient, reliable, and robust by providing two key features i) data integrity through immutable ledgers and ii) automation of business workflows leveraging smart contracts. The paper will present the system architecture, extensible data model and the application of SmartQC in the context of example smart manufacturing applications. |

In particular, we distinguish between authentication factors that are verified against the blockchain and the ones verified locally (or against a centralized party). With this in mind, we define notions for $k-factor$ authentication against the blockchain and $k-factor$ authentication against the authentication factors. Based on these notions, we propose a classification of authentication schemes. We extend our classification to accommodate the threshold signatures and signing transactions by centralized parties (such as exchanges or co-signing services). Finally, we apply our classification to existing wallet solutions, which we compare based on various security and key-management features. |

Robust solutions are needed to mitigate vulnerabilities in manufacturing and integration. This paper puts forth a novel blockchain-based approach to secure OPEN-RAN equipment through its lifecycle. By combining firmware authentication codes, a permissioned blockchain ledger, and equipment node validators, we architect a tamper-resistant ecosystem to track provenance. The outlined design, while conceptual, establishes a foundation and roadmap for future realization. Through careful implementation planning, development of core components like firmware signed hashes and smart contracts, and rigorous performance evaluation, this paper can evolve from concept to practice. There is a vivid potential to make OPEN-RAN supply chains corner to corner secure, igniting further research and real-world deployment. |
|**2024-02-27**|**PureLottery: Fair and Bias-Resistant Leader Election with a Novel Single-Elimination Tournament Algorithm**|Jonas Ballweg et.al.|[2402.17459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17459)| Leader Election (LE) is crucial in distributed systems and blockchain technology, ensuring one participant acts as the leader. Traditional LE methods often depend on distributed random number generation (RNG), facing issues like vulnerability to manipulation, lack of fairness, and the need for complex procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS). This Bachelor's thesis presents a novel approach to randomized LE, leveraging a game-theoretic assumption that participants, aiming to be chosen as leaders, will naturally avoid actions that diminish their chances. This perspective simplifies LE by eliminating the need for decentralized RNG. Introducing PureLottery, inspired by single-elimination sports tournaments, this method offers a fair, bias-resistant, and efficient LE solution for blockchain environments. It operates on the principle of two participants competing in each match, rendering collusion efforts useless. PureLottery stands out for its low computational and communication complexity, suitable for smart contract implementation. It provides strong game-theoretic incentives for honesty and is robust against adversaries, ensuring no increase in election chances through dishonesty. The protocol guarantees that each honest player has at least a 1/n chance of winning, irrespective of adversary manipulation among the other n-1 participants. PureLottery can also address related problems like participant ranking, electing multiple leaders, and leader aversion, showcasing its versatility across various applications, including lotteries and blockchain protocols. An open-source implementation is made available for public use. |

|**2024-02-27**|**Time-Restricted Double-Spending Attack on PoW-based Blockchains**|Yiming Jiang et.al.|[2402.17223](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17223)| Numerous blockchain applications are designed with tasks that naturally have finite durations, and hence, a double-spending attack (DSA) on such blockchain applications leans towards being conducted within a finite timeframe, specifically before the completion of their tasks. Furthermore, existing research suggests that practical attackers typically favor executing a DSA within a finite timeframe due to their limited computational resources. These observations serve as the impetus for this paper to investigate a time-restricted DSA (TR-DSA) model on Proof-of-Work based blockchains. In this TR-DSA model, an attacker only mines its branch within a finite timeframe, and the TR-DSA is considered unsuccessful if the attacker's branch fails to surpass the honest miners' branch when the honest miners' branch has grown by a specific number of blocks. First, we developed a general closed-form expression for the success probability of a TR-DSA. This developed probability not only can assist in evaluating the risk of a DSA on blockchain applications with timely tasks, but also can enable practical attackers with limited computational resources to assess the feasibility and expected reward of launching a TR-DSA. In addition, we provide rigorous proof that the success probability of a TR-DSA is no greater than that of a time-unrestricted DSA where the attacker indefinitely mines its branch. This result implies that blockchain applications with timely tasks are less vulnerable to DSAs than blockchain applications that provide attackers with an unlimited timeframe for their attacks. Furthermore, we show that the success probability of a TR-DSA is always smaller than one even though the attacker controls more than half of the hash rate in the network. This result alerts attackers that there is still a risk of failure in launching a TR-DSA even if they amass a majority of the hash rate in the network. |
|**2024-02-27**|**Blockchain for Finance: A Survey**|Hanjie Wu et.al.|[2402.17219](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17219)| As an innovative technology for enhancing authenticity, security, and risk management, blockchain is being widely adopted in trade and finance systems. The unique capabilities of blockchain, such as immutability and transparency, enable new business models of distributed data storage, point-to-point transactions, and decentralized autonomous organizations. In this paper, we focus on blockchain-based securities trading, in which blockchain technology plays a vital role in financial services as it ultimately lifts trust and frees the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. We investigate the 12 most popular blockchain platforms and elaborate on 6 platforms that are related to finance, seeking to provide a panorama of securities trading practices. Meanwhile, this survey provides a comprehensive summary of blockchain-based securities trading applications. We gather numerous practical applications of blockchain-based securities trading and categorize them into four distinct categories. For each category, we introduce a typical example and explain how blockchain contributes to solving the key problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. Finally, we provide interesting observations ranging from mainstream blockchain-based financial institutions to security issues of decentralized finance applications, aiming to picture the current blockchain ecosystem in finance. |

This complexity is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper, we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead, thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models. |

A key challenge toward implementing data sharding is verifying whether the entirety of a block's data is available in the network (across its shards). A central technique proposed to conduct this verification uses erasure-coded blocks and is called data availability sampling (DAS). While the high-level protocol details of DAS have been well discussed in the community, discussions around how such a protocol will be implemented at the peer-to-peer layer are lacking. We identify random sampling of nodes as a fundamental primitive necessary to carry out DAS and present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of a large number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., 50% of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for DAS functions in both full nodes and light nodes. |

Driven by the movement toward Web 3.0, recent systems started to provide distributed services, such as computation outsourcing or file storage, on top of the currency exchange medium. By allowing anyone to join and collect payments for serving others, these systems create decentralized markets for trading digital resources. Yet, there is still a big gap between the promise of these markets and their practical viability. Existing initiatives are still early-stage and have already encountered security and efficiency obstacles. At the same time, existing work around promising ideas, specifically sidechains, fall short in exploiting their full potential in addressing these problems.   To bridge this gap, we propose chainBoost, a secure performance booster for decentralized resource markets. It expedites service related operations, reduces the blockchain size, and supports flexible service-payment exchange modalities at low overhead. At its core, chainBoost employs a sidechain, that has a (security and semantic) mutual-dependence with the mainchain, to which the system offloads heavy/frequent operations. To enable it, we develop a novel sidechain architecture composed of temporary and permanent blocks, a block suppression mechanism to prune the sidechain, a syncing protocol to permit arbitrary data exchange between the two chains, and an autorecovery protocol to support robustness and resilience. We analyze the security of chainBoost, and implement a proof-of-concept prototype for a distributed file storage market as a use case. For a market handling around 2000 transactions per round, our experiments show up to 11x improvement in throughput and 94% reduction in confirmation time. They also show that chainBoost can reduce the main blockchain size by around 90%. |
|**2024-09-30**|**MEV Sharing with Dynamic Extraction Rates**|Pedro Braga et.al.|[2402.15849](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15849)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a new frontier in the design of blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose making the MEV extraction rate as part of the protocol design space. Our aim is to leverage this parameter to maintain a healthy balance between block producers (who need to be compensated) and users (who need to feel encouraged to transact). We follow the approach introduced by EIP-1559 and design a similar mechanism to dynamically update the MEV extraction rate with the goal of stabilizing it at a target value. We study the properties of this dynamic mechanism and show that, while convergence to the target can be guaranteed for certain parameters, instability, and even chaos, can occur in other cases. Despite these complexities, under general conditions, the system concentrates in a neighborhood of the target equilibrium implying high long-term performance. Our work establishes, the first to our knowledge, dynamic framework for the integral problem of MEV sharing between extractors and users. |

Therefore, message authentication is a crucial security feature in drone communications. This paper presents a Blockchain-based Efficient, and Trusted Authentication scheme for UAV communication, BETA-UAV, which exploits the inherent properties of blockchain technology concerning memorability and is immutable to record communication sessions via transactions using a smart contract. The smart contract in BETA-UAV allows participants to publish and call transactions from the blockchain network. Furthermore, transaction addresses are proof of freshness and trustworthiness for subsequent transmissions. Furthermore, we investigated their ability to resist active attacks, such as impersonation, replaying, and modification. In addition, we evaluate the gas costs associated with the functions of the smart contract by implementing a BETA-UAV on the Ethereum public blockchain. A comparison of the computation and communication overheads shows that the proposed approach can save significant costs over traditional techniques. |
|**2024-02-23**|**A Blockchain-Enabled Framework of UAV Coordination for Post-Disaster Networks**|Sana Hafeez et.al.|[2402.15331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15331)| Emergency communication is critical but challenging after natural disasters when ground infrastructure is devastated. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer enormous potential for agile relief coordination in these scenarios. However, effectively leveraging UAV fleets poses additional challenges around security, privacy, and efficient collaboration across response agencies. This paper presents a robust blockchain-enabled framework to address these challenges by integrating a consortium blockchain model, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques to securely coordinate UAV fleets for disaster response. Specifically, we make two key contributions: a consortium blockchain architecture for secure and private multi-agency coordination; and an optimized consensus protocol balancing efficiency and fault tolerance using a delegated proof of stake practical byzantine fault tolerance (DPoS-PBFT). Comprehensive simulations showcase the framework's ability to enhance transparency, automation, scalability, and cyber-attack resilience for UAV coordination in post-disaster networks. |
|**2024-02-23**|**Trustworthy confidential virtual machines for the masses**|Anna Galanou et.al.|[2402.15277](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15277)| Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure. |

Despite the promise, the high computational demands of AI on blockchain raise significant privacy and efficiency concerns. The Optimistic Privacy-Preserving AI (opp/ai) framework is introduced as a pioneering solution to these issues, striking a balance between privacy protection and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) for privacy with Optimistic Machine Learning (opML) for efficiency, creating a hybrid model tailored for blockchain AI services. This study presents the opp/ai framework, delves into the privacy features of zkML, and assesses the framework's performance and adaptability across different scenarios. |

The challenge lies in securely storing vast amounts of data and extracting useful information to promptly identify unhealthy bridge conditions. To address this challenge, we propose BIONIB, wherein real-time IoT data is stored on the blockchain for monitoring bridges. One of the emerging blockchains, EOSIO is used because of its exceptional scaling capabilities for monitoring the health of bridges. The approach involves collecting data from IoT sensors and using an unsupervised machine learning-based technique called the Novelty Index (NI) to observe meaningful patterns in the data. Smart contracts of EOSIO are used in implementation because of their efficiency, security, and programmability, making them well-suited for handling complex transactions and automating processes within decentralized applications. BIONIB provides secure storage benefits of blockchain, as well as useful predictions based on the NI. Performance analysis uses real-time data collected from IoT sensors at the bridge in healthy and unhealthy states. The data is collected with extensive experimentation with different loads, climatic conditions, and the health of the bridge. The performance of BIONIB under varying numbers of sensors and various numbers of participating blockchain nodes is observed. We observe a tradeoff between throughput, latency, and computational resources. Storage efficiency can be increased by manifolds with a slight increase in latency caused by NI calculation. As latency is not a significant concern in bridge health applications, the results demonstrate that BIONIB has high throughput, parallel processing, and high security while efficiently scaled. |
|**2024-02-22**|**Stability of P2P Networks Under Greedy Peering (Full Version)**|Lucianna Kiffer et.al.|[2402.14666](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14666)| Major cryptocurrency networks have relied on random peering choice rules for making connections in their peer-to-peer networks. Generally, these choices have good properties, particularly for open, permissionless networks. Random peering choices however do not take into account that some actors may choose to optimize who they connect to such that they are quicker to hear about information being propagated in the network. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of such greedy strategies. We study a model in which nodes select peers with the objective of minimizing their average distance to a designated subset of nodes in the network, and consider the impact of several factors including the peer selection process, degree constraints, and the size of the designated subset. The latter is particularly interesting in the context of blockchain networks as generally only a subset of nodes are the propagation source for content.   We first analyze an idealized version of the game where each node has full knowledge of the current network and aims to select the $d$ best connections, and prove the existence of equilibria under various model assumptions. Since in reality nodes only have local knowledge based on their peers' behavior, we also study a greedy protocol which runs in rounds, with each node replacing its worst-performing edge with a new random edge. We exactly characterize stability properties of networks that evolve with this peering rule and derive regimes where stability is possible and even inevitable. We also run extensive simulations with this peering rule examining both how the network evolves and how different network parameters affect the stability properties of the network. Our findings generally show that the only stable networks that arise from greedy peering choices are low-diameter and result in disparate performance for nodes in the network. |

Setting up meaningful tests for permissionless blockchain technology is a notoriously complex task for several reasons: software is complex, large number of nodes are involved, network is non ideal, etc. Developers usually adopt small virtual laboratories or costly real devnets, based on real software. Researchers usually prefer simulations of a large number of nodes, based on simplified models. In this paper, we aim to obtain the advantages of both approaches, i.e., performing large, realistic, inexpensive, and flexible experiments, using real blockchain software within a virtual environment. To do that, we tackle the challenge of running large blockchain networks in a single physical machine, leveraging Linux and Docker. We analyze a number of problems that arise when large blockchain networks are emulated and we provide technical solutions for all of them. Finally, we describe two experiences of emulating fairly large blockchain networks on a single machine, adopting both research oriented and production oriented software, and involving up to more than 3000 containers. |
|**2024-02-21**|**Trustworthy Distributed Certification of Program Execution**|Alex Wolf et.al.|[2402.13792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13792)| Verifying the execution of a program is complicated and often limited by the inability to validate the code's correctness. It is a crucial aspect of scientific research, where it is needed to ensure the reproducibility and validity of experimental results. Similarly, in customer software testing, it is difficult for customers to verify that their specific program version was tested or executed at all. Existing state-of-the-art solutions, such as hardware-based approaches, constraint solvers, and verifiable computation systems, do not provide definitive proof of execution, which hinders reliable testing and analysis of program results. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that combines a prototype programming language called Mona with a certification protocol OCCP to enable the distributed and decentralized re-execution of program segments. Our protocol allows for certification of program segments in a distributed, immutable, and trustworthy system without the need for naive re-execution, resulting in significant improvements in terms of time and computational resources used. We also explore the use of blockchain technology to manage the protocol workflow following other approaches in this space. Our approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of program execution verification and opens up opportunities for further research and development in this area. Our findings demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in reducing the number of program executions compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, thus improving the efficiency of certifying program executions. |
|**2024-02-20**|**Integrating Blockchain technology within an Information Ecosystem**|Francesco Salzano et.al.|[2402.13191](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13191)| Context: Blockchain-based Information Ecosystems (BBIEs) are a type of information ecosystem in which blockchain technology is used to provide a trust mechanism among parties and to manage shared business logic, breaking the traditional scheme of Information Ecosystems dominated by a leading company and leveraging the decentralization of data management, information flow, and business logic. Objective: In this paper, we propose architecture and technical aspects concerning the creation of a BBIE, underlining the advantages supplied and the logic decomposition among the business and storage components. Method: The requirements are derived from the current needs of the collaborative business and the data collected by surveying practitioners. To get these needs we followed the Grounded Theory research approach. We validate our architectural schema against a case study dealing with the management of a wine supply chain, also involving different companies and supervision authorities. Results: The proposed solution integrates blockchain-based applications with the existing information system as a module of the ecosystem, leveraging on the low costs, scalability, and high-level security because of the restricted access to the network. Conclusion: We must go a long way in deepening and refining the possibilities offered by technology in supporting innovative multi-organizational business models. BBIEs can contribute substantially to paving the way in such a direction. |

Use of Blockchain technology-based platform can significantly improve scalability and response time for processing of claims which are otherwise manually-intensive and time-consuming. However, the chaincodes involved within the processes that issue claims, approve or deny them as required, need to be formally verified to ensure secure and reliable processing of transactions in Blockchain. In this paper, we use a formal modeling approach to verify various processes and their underlying chaincodes relating to different stages in insurance claims processing viz., issuance, approval, denial, and flagging for fraud investigation by using linear temporal logic (LTL). We simulate the formalism on the chaincodes and analyze the breach of chaincodes via model checking. |

DSNs bring together affordable storage resources from around the world to provide robust, decentralized storage services for tens of thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). However, existing DSNs do not offer verifiability when implementing erasure coding for redundant storage, making them vulnerable to Byzantine encoders. Additionally, there is a lack of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for optimal resilience in DSNs. This paper introduces BFT-DSN, a Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized storage network designed to address these challenges. BFT-DSN combines storage-weighted BFT consensus with erasure coding and incorporates homomorphic fingerprints and weighted threshold signatures for decentralized verification. The implementation of BFT-DSN demonstrates its comparable performance in terms of storage cost and latency as well as superior performance in Byzantine resilience when compared to existing industrial decentralized storage networks. |

However, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, which, if exploited, can lead to significant asset losses. This study explores the potential of enhancing smart contract security audits using the GPT-4 model. We utilized a dataset of 35 smart contracts from the SolidiFI-benchmark vulnerability library, containing 732 vulnerabilities, and compared it with five other vulnerability detection tools to evaluate GPT-4's ability to identify seven common types of vulnerabilities. Moreover, we assessed GPT-4's performance in code parsing and vulnerability capture by simulating a professional auditor's auditing process using CoT(Chain of Thought) prompts based on the audit reports of eight groups of smart contracts. We also evaluated GPT-4's ability to write Solidity Proof of Concepts (PoCs). Through experimentation, we found that GPT-4 performed poorly in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, with a high Precision of 96.6%, but a low Recall of 37.8%, and an F1-score of 41.1%, indicating a tendency to miss vulnerabilities during detection. Meanwhile, it demonstrated good contract code parsing capabilities, with an average comprehensive score of 6.5, capable of identifying the background information and functional relationships of smart contracts; in 60% of the cases, it could write usable PoCs, suggesting GPT-4 has significant potential application in PoC writing. These experimental results indicate that GPT-4 lacks the ability to detect smart contract vulnerabilities effectively, but its performance in contract code parsing and PoC writing demonstrates its significant potential as an auxiliary tool in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of smart contract security audits. |

Later, blockchain became a widespread emerging technology, utilised in multifaceted sectors and applications. In fact, various new and innovative application of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are still continuously being researched and explored. On the other hand, smart-contracts were first introduced in 1990s, however, it did not gain enough popularity until being integrated with blockchain technologies lately. The duo lately been seen as the key to many innovations in various industries and sectors. So, we took data from 1445 blockchain-related patent documents and tried to map out the historical and current trends in patenting activities in the blockchain field. This helps us get a better grasp of how blockchain technologies are evolving and being tracked. In addition to serving as an indicator of science and technology growth, patents are also used to judge the research potential and development of a particular technology. |

|**2024-02-16**|**Towards benchmarking of Solidity verification tools**|Massimo Bartoletti et.al.|[2402.10750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10750)| Formal verification of smart contracts has become a hot topic in academic and industrial research, given the growing value of assets managed by decentralized applications and the consequent incentive for adversaries to tamper with them. Most of the current research on the verification of contracts revolves around Solidity, the main high-level language supported by Ethereum and other leading blockchains. Although bug detection tools for Solidity have been proliferating almost since the inception of Ethereum, only in the last few years we have seen verification tools capable of proving that a contract respects some desirable properties. An open issue is how to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these tools: indeed, the existing benchmarks for general-purpose programming languages cannot be adapted to Solidity, given substantial differences in the programming model and in the desirable properties. We address this problem by proposing an open benchmark for Solidity verification tools. By exploiting our benchmark, we compare two leading tools, SolCMC and Certora, discussing their completeness, soundness and expressiveness limitations. |

Blockchain accounts secure most on-chain assets in this huge market (Web-12). This paper initiates a universal blockchain account model from a comprehensive review of blockchain account development, encompassing both academic and industry perspectives. This paper uses a model analysis method to analysis the account progress and create high level new account model. And it uses systematic literature review method to search, filter, analysis and evaluate the papers about account models and analyzes related technology trade-offs. Searching with key words: blockchain, account, private key and security in WOS, Scopus and Bitcoin and Ethereum community repositories, this research provides in-depth insights into the design and evaluation of account models, from traditional bank accounts to Bitcoin, EVM-adaptable, and abstraction accounts. Through data-driven comparisons of account models (security, cost, adoption), this study also explores future directions and provides an overview of cross-model account theory, guiding further blockchain research. This paper leaves deeper dives into model change drivers, application technology advancements. |
|**2024-02-15**|**Transaction Capacity, Security and Latency in Blockchains**|Mustafa Doger et.al.|[2402.10138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10138)| We analyze how secure a block is after the block becomes k-deep, i.e., security-latency, for Nakamoto consensus under an exponential network delay model. We give parameter regimes for which transactions are safe when sufficiently deep in the chain. We compare our results for Nakamoto consensus under bounded network delay models and obtain analogous bounds for safety violation threshold. Next, modeling the blockchain system as a batch service queue with exponential network delay, we connect the security-latency analysis to sustainable transaction rate of the queue system. As our model assumes exponential network delay, batch service queue models give a meaningful trade-off between transaction capacity, security and latency. As adversary can attack the queue service to hamper the service process, we consider two different attacks for adversary. In an extreme scenario, we modify the selfish-mining attack for this purpose and consider its effect on the sustainable transaction rate of the queue. |

The Ethereum community has proposed comprehensive data-sharding techniques to overcome storage, computational, and network processing limitations. In this context, the propagation and availability of large blocks become the subject of research to achieve scalable data-sharding. This paper provides insights after exploring the usage of a Kademlia-based DHT to enable Data Availability Sampling (DAS) in Ethereum. It presents a DAS-DHT simulator to study this problem and validates the results of the simulator with experiments in a real DHT network, IPFS. Our results help us understand what parts of DAS can be achieved based on existing Kademlia DHT solutions and which ones cannot. We discuss the limitations of DHT solutions and discuss other alternatives. |

The strategic importance of choosing \emph{when} to vote arises when votes are public, such as in online event scheduling polls (e.g., Doodle), or in blockchain governance mechanisms. In particular, there is a tension between voting early to influence future votes and waiting to observe interim results and avoid voting costs if the outcome has already been decided.   Our study draws on empirical findings showing that "temporal" bandwagon effects occur when interim results are revealed to the electorate: late voters are more likely to vote for leading candidates. To capture this phenomenon, we analyze a novel model where the electorate consists of informed voters who have a preferred candidate, and uninformed swing voters who can be swayed according to the interim outcome at the time of voting. In our main results, we prove the existence of equilibria where both early and late voting occur with a positive probability, and we characterize conditions that lead to the appearance of "last minute" voting behavior, where all informed voters vote late. |

However, current Web 3.0 applications supported by blockchain infrastructure still cannot support complex data analytics tasks in a scalable and privacy-preserving way. This paper introduces the emerging federated analytics (FA) paradigm into the realm of Web 3.0 services, enabling data to stay local while still contributing to complex web analytics tasks in a privacy-preserving way. We propose FedWeb, a tailored FA design for important frequent pattern mining tasks in Web 3.0. FedWeb remarkably reduces the number of required participating data owners to support privacy-preserving Web 3.0 data analytics based on a novel distributed differential privacy technique. The correctness of mining results is guaranteed by a theoretically rigid candidate filtering scheme based on Hoeffding's inequality and Chebychev's inequality. Two response budget saving solutions are proposed to further reduce participating data owners. Experiments on three representative Web 3.0 scenarios show that FedWeb can improve data utility by ~25.3% and reduce the participating data owners by ~98.4%. |
|**2024-04-21**|**Mechanism Design for Automated Market Makers**|T-H. Hubert Chan et.al.|[2402.09357](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09357)| Blockchains have popularized automated market makers (AMMs). An AMM exchange is an application running on a blockchain which maintains a pool of crypto-assets and automatically trades assets with users governed by some pricing function that prices the assets based on their relative demand/supply. AMMs have created an important challenge commonly known as the Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In particular, the miners who control the contents and ordering of transactions in a block can extract value by front-running and back-running users' transactions, leading to arbitrage opportunities that guarantee them risk-free returns.   In this paper, we consider how to design AMM mechanisms that eliminate MEV opportunities. Specifically, we propose a new AMM mechanism that processes all transactions contained within a block in a batch. We show that our new mechanism satisfies two tiers of guarantees. First, for legacy blockchains where each block is proposed by a single (possibly rotating) miner, we prove that our mechanism satisfies arbitrage resilience, i.e., a miner cannot gain risk-free profit. Moreover, we also guarantee fair treatment among all transactions within the same block, such that the miner is unable to sell off favorable positions in the block to users or arbitragers. Second, for blockchains where the block proposal process is decentralized and offers sequencing-fairness, we prove a stronger notion called incentive compatibility -- roughly speaking, we guarantee that any individual user's best response is to follow the honest strategy. |
|**2024-06-19**|**Collusion-Resilience in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Hao Chung et.al.|[2402.09321](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321)| Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions included and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated the formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of collusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism satisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention between transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many eligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23) considered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called c-side-contract-proofness (c-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention between transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and c-SCP for any c at least 1. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to "steal from the protocol." On the other hand, the c-SCP condition requires that a coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit through strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the users outside the coalition).   Our main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between transactions, no (possibly randomized) TFM in which users are expected to bid truthfully satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness. This result resolves the main open question in Roughgarden (EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of the basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented. |
|**2024-02-14**|**Teamwork Makes TEE Work: Open and Resilient Remote Attestation on Decentralized Trust**|Xiaolin Zhang et.al.|[2402.08908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08908)| Remote Attestation (RA) enables the integrity and authenticity of applications in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to be verified. Existing TEE RA designs employ a centralized trust model where they rely on a single provisioned secret key and a centralized verifier to establish trust for remote parties. This model is however brittle and can be untrusted under advanced attacks nowadays. Besides, most designs only provide fixed functionalities once deployed, making them hard to adapt to different needs on availability, Quality of Service (QoS), etc.   Therefore, we propose JANUS, an open and resilient TEE RA scheme. To decentralize trust, we, on one hand, introduce Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) as an intrinsic root of trust (RoT) in TEE to provide additional measurements and cryptographic enhancements. On the other hand, we use blockchain and smart contract to realize decentralized verification and result audit. Furthermore, we design an automated turnout mechanism that allows JANUS to remain resilient and offer flexible RA services under various situations. We provide a UC-based security proof and demonstrate the scalability and generality of JANUS by implementing an open-sourced prototype. |
|**2024-05-18**|**Multidimensional Blockchain Fees are (Essentially) Optimal**|Guillermo Angeris et.al.|[2402.08661](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08661)| In this paper we show that, using only mild assumptions, previously proposed multidimensional blockchain fee markets are essentially optimal, even against worst-case adversaries. In particular, we show that the average welfare gap between the following two scenarios is at most $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the length of the time horizon considered. In the first scenario, the designer knows all future actions by users and is allowed to fix the optimal prices of resources ahead of time, based on the designer's oracular knowledge of those actions. In the second, the prices are updated by a very simple algorithm that does not have this oracular knowledge, a special case of which is similar to EIP-1559, the base fee mechanism used by the Ethereum blockchain. Roughly speaking, this means that, on average, over a reasonable timescale, there is no difference in welfare between 'correctly' fixing the prices, with oracular knowledge of the future, when compared to the proposed algorithm. We show a matching lower bound of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ for any implementable algorithm and also separately consider the case where the adversary is known to be stochastic. |

We show that continuous-time best-response dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agents' behavior in these games. |

Our framework ensures the integrity of firmware execution and data processing in potentially compromised IoT devices. By leveraging the concept of ZKP, we establish a trust layer that facilitates secure, autonomous communication between IoT devices in environments where devices may not inherently trust each other. The framework includes zk-Devices, which utilize functional commitment to generate proofs for executed programs, and service contracts for encoding interaction logic among devices. It also utilizes a blockchain layer and a relayer as a ZKP storage and data communication protocol, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that proof generation, reading, and verification take approximately 694, 5078, and 19 milliseconds in our system setup, respectively. These timings meet the practical requirements for IoT device communication, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our solution. The zk-IoT framework represents a significant advancement in the realm of IoT security, paving the way for reliable and scalable IoT networks across various applications, such as smart city infrastructures, healthcare systems, and industrial automation. |
|**2024-02-26**|**The Blocklace: A Universal, Byzantine Fault-Tolerant, Conflict-free Replicated Data Type**|Paulo Sérgio Almeida et.al.|[2402.08068](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08068)| Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are designed for replica convergence without global coordination or consensus. Recent work has achieves the same in a Byzantine environment, through DAG-like structures based on cryptographic hashes of content.   The blocklace is a partially-ordered generalization of the blockchain in which each block has any finite number of signed hash pointers to preceding blocks. We show that the blocklace datatype, with the sole operation of adding a single block, is a CRDT: it is both a pure operation-based CRDT, with self-tagging; and a delta-state CRDT, under a slight generalization of the delta framework. Allowing arbitrary values as payload, the blocklace can also be seen as a universal Byzantine fault-tolerant implementation for arbitrary CRDTs, under the operation-based approach.   Current approaches only care about CRDT convergence, being equivocation-tolerant (they do not detect or prevent equivocations), allowing a Byzantine node to cause an arbitrary amount of harm by polluting the CRDT state with an infinite number of equivocations.   We show that a blocklace can be used not only in an equivocation-tolerant way, but also so as to detect and eventually exclude Byzantine behavior, namely equivocations, even under the presence of collusion. The blocklace CRDT protocol ensures that the Byzantine nodes may harm only a finite prefix of the computation. |
|**2024-07-23**|**Proof of Diligence: Cryptoeconomic Security for Rollups**|Peiyao Sheng et.al.|[2402.07241](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07241)| Layer 1 (L1) blockchains such as Ethereum are secured under an "honest supermajority of stake" assumption for a large pool of validators who verify each and every transaction on it. This high security comes at a scalability cost which not only effects the throughput of the blockchain but also results in high gas fees for executing transactions on chain. The most successful solution for this problem is provided by optimistic rollups, Layer 2 (L2) blockchains that execute transactions outside L1 but post the transaction data on L1.   The security for such L2 chains is argued, informally, under the assumption that a set of nodes will check the transaction data posted on L1 and raise an alarm (a fraud proof) if faulty transactions are detected. However, all current deployments lack a proper incentive mechanism for ensuring that these nodes will do their job ``diligently'', and simply rely on a cursory incentive alignment argument for security.   We solve this problem by introducing an incentivized watchtower network designed to serve as the first line of defense for rollups. Our main contribution is a ``Proof of Diligence'' protocol that requires watchtowers to continuously provide a proof that they have verified L2 assertions and get rewarded for the same. Proof of Diligence protocol includes a carefully-designed incentive mechanism that is provably secure when watchtowers are rational actors, under a mild rational independence assumption. |

However, the existing client/server infrastructure poses significant security and privacy challenges, necessitating strict adherence to healthcare data regulations. To combat these issues, a decentralized approach is imperative, and blockchain technology emerges as a compelling solution for strengthening Internet of Things and medical systems security. This paper introduces HNMblock, a model that elevates the realms of epidemiological monitoring, medical system security, and wellness enhancement. By harnessing the transparency and immutability inherent in blockchain, HNMblock empowers real-time, tamper-proof tracking of epidemiological data, enabling swift responses to disease outbreaks. Furthermore, it fortifies the security of medical systems through advanced cryptographic techniques and smart contracts, with a paramount focus on safeguarding patient privacy. HNMblock also fosters personalized healthcare, encouraging patient involvement and data-informed decision-making. The integration of blockchain within the healthcare domain, as exemplified by HNMblock, holds the potential to revolutionize data management, epidemiological surveillance, and wellness, as meticulously explored in this research article. |

Santos et.al.|[2402.06704](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06704)| Document management in the rental market is a critical process to ensure the accuracy of financial transactions and regulatory compliance in the sector. In Portugal, the challenges include the complexity of legislation, particularly GDPR non-compliance, lack of transparency, and bureaucratic process inefficiency. With this in mind, a solution based on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain platform, is presented for the implementation of a document management system for the rental process. This system oversees the rental process, which consists of three phases: the application for a property by the prospective tenant through the upload of necessary documents, acceptance/rejection by the landlord of various received applications, and the creation of a report by the system, which only the auditor can request and view. The system smart contract records metadata associated with the documents (hash, owner) and coordinates requests for file access by landlords to prospective tenants. Thus, the system is responsible for creating immutable and traceable records of the entire process. The underlying platform serves as the foundation for conducting future audits. After the landlord verifies the files and accepts the rental proposal, any authorised auditor can request a report for a property by accessing the records through the final report, which includes all events that occurred during the process. |

Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, and Bernardo Kastrup's analytical idealism, which lead to considering our perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a different form of consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the developmental stages of AGI, the requirements for the emergence of an embodied AGI, the importance of a calibrated symbolic interface for AGI, and the key role played by the metaverse, decentralized systems, open-source blockchain technology, as well as open-source AI research. It also explores the idea of a feedback loop between AGI and human users in metaverse spaces as a tool for AGI calibration, as well as the role of local homeostasis and decentralized governance as preconditions for achieving a stable embodied AGI. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI. |

In bribing attacks, an adversary offers participants a reward in exchange for instructing them how to behave, with the goal of attacking the protocol's properties. Specifically, our work focuses on adversaries that target blockchain safety. We consider two types of bribing, depending on how the bribes are awarded: i) guided bribing, where the bribe is given as long as the bribed party behaves as instructed; ii) effective bribing, where bribes are conditional on the attack's success, w.r.t. well-defined metrics. We analyze each type of attack in a game theoretic setting and identify relevant equilibria. In guided bribing, we show that the protocol is not an equilibrium and then describe good equilibria, where the attack is unsuccessful, and a negative one, where all parties are bribed such that the attack succeeds. In effective bribing, we show that both the protocol and the "all bribed" setting are equilibria. Using the identified equilibria, we then compute bounds on the Prices of Stability and Anarchy. Our results indicate that additional mitigations are needed for guided bribing, so our analysis concludes with incentive-based mitigation techniques, namely slashing and dilution. Here, we present two positive results, that both render the protocol an equilibrium and achieve maximal welfare for all parties, and a negative result, wherein an attack becomes more plausible if it severely affects the ledger's token's market price. |

Multirobot systems (MRS) research has provided many approaches to establish control and communication layers to facilitate collaboration from a technical perspective, such as granting more autonomy to heterogeneous robotic groups through auction-based interactions in mesh networks. However, stakeholders' competing economic interests often prevent them from cooperating within a proprietary ecosystem. Related work suggests that distributed ledger technology (DLT) might serve as a mechanism for enterprises to coordinate workflows and trade services to explore space resources through a transparent, reliable, non-proprietary digital platform. We challenge this perspective by pointing to the core technical weaknesses of blockchains, in particular, increased energy consumption, low throughput, and full transparency through redundancy. Our objective is to advance the discussion in a direction where the benefits of DLT from an economic perspective are weighted against the drawbacks from a technical perspective. We finally present a possible DLT-driven heterogeneous MRS for map exploration to study the opportunities for economic collaboration and competitiveness. |

However, these stakeholders' competing economic interests may hinder effective collaboration on a centralized digital platform. To address this issue, neutral and transparent infrastructures could facilitate coordination and value exchange among heterogeneous space MRS. While related work has expressed legitimate concerns about the technical challenges associated with blockchain use in space, we argue that weighing its potential economic benefits against its drawbacks is necessary. This paper presents a novel architectural framework and a comprehensive set of requirements for integrating blockchain technology in MRS, aiming to enhance coordination and data integrity in space exploration missions. We explored distributed ledger technology (DLT) to design a non-proprietary architecture for heterogeneous MRS and validated the prototype in a simulated lunar environment. The analyses of our implementation suggest global ISRU efficiency improvements for map exploration, compared to a corresponding group of individually acting robots, and that fostering a coopetitive environment may provide additional revenue opportunities for stakeholders. |
|**2024-02-15**|**Blockchain-enabled Clustered and Scalable Federated Learning (BCS-FL) Framework in UAV Networks**|Sana Hafeez et.al.|[2402.05973](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05973)| Privacy, scalability, and reliability are significant challenges in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks as distributed systems, especially when employing machine learning (ML) technologies with substantial data exchange. Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) to UAV networks has improved collaboration, privacy, resilience, and adaptability, making it a promising framework for UAV applications. However, implementing FL for UAV networks introduces drawbacks such as communication overhead, synchronization issues, scalability limitations, and resource constraints. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Blockchain-enabled Clustered and Scalable Federated Learning (BCS-FL) framework for UAV networks. This improves the decentralization, coordination, scalability, and efficiency of FL in large-scale UAV networks. The framework partitions UAV networks into separate clusters, coordinated by cluster head UAVs (CHs), to establish a connected graph. Clustering enables efficient coordination of updates to the ML model. Additionally, hybrid inter-cluster and intra-cluster model aggregation schemes generate the global model after each training round, improving collaboration and knowledge sharing among clusters. The numerical findings illustrate the achievement of convergence while also emphasizing the trade-offs between the effectiveness of training and communication efficiency. |
|**2024-02-08**|**Blockchain Based Residential Smart Rent**|André S. Proença et.al.|[2402.05737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05737)| The real estate market includes complex and inefficient mediation processes. Renting a property envolves multiple entities with different responsibilities and interests. Therefore it is imperative to establish a trustful relationship between parties through intermediaries such as notaries, banks or real estate agencies to avoid eventual disputes. Although an intermediary ensures trust, the current process still has some drawbacks concerning efficiency, costs, transparency, bureaucracy and data security. The blockchain technology aims to reduce this issues by providing transparent and secure real estate transactions. We propose a GDPR compliant blockchain-based residential smart rental platform, designed to allow both landlords and tenants to establish rental contracts and make rental payments securely. |

Within this class, Luby Transform (LT) coded blockchains are an appealing choice for scalability owing to the availability of a wide range of low-complexity decoders. In the first part of this work, we identify that traditional LT decoders like Belief Propagation and On-the-Fly Gaussian Elimination may not be optimal for heterogeneous networks with nodes that have varying computational and download capabilities. To address this, we introduce a family of hybrid decoders for LT codes and propose optimal operating regimes for them to recover the blockchain at the lowest decoding cost. While LT coded blockchain architecture has been studied from the aspects of storage savings and scalability, not much is known in terms of its security vulnerabilities. Pointing at this research gap, in the second part, we present novel denial-of-service threats on LT coded blockchains that target nodes with specific decoding capabilities, preventing them from joining the network. Our proposed threats are non-oblivious in nature, wherein adversaries gain access to the archived blocks, and choose to execute their attack on a subset of them based on underlying coding scheme. We show that our optimized threats can achieve the same level of damage as that of blind attacks, however, with limited amount of resources. Overall, this is the first work of its kind that opens up new questions on designing coded blockchains to jointly provide storage savings, scalability and also resilience to optimized threats. |

Given that computers are becoming increasingly multicore, concurrency is an attractive approach to improve programs' execution runtime. A unique challenge of blockchains is that all replicas (miners or validators) must execute all smart contracts in the same logical order to maintain the semantics of State Machine Replication (SMR).   In this work, we study the maximal level of parallelism attainable when focusing on the conflict graph between transactions packaged in the same block. This exposes a performance vulnerability that block creators may exploit against existing blockchain concurrency solutions, which rely on a total ordering phase for maintaining consistency amongst all replicas. To facilitate the formal aspects of our study, we develop a novel generic framework for Active State Machine Replication (ASMR) that is strictly serializable. We introduce the concept of graph scheduling and the definition of the minimal latency scheduling problem, which we prove to be NP-hard. We show that the restricted version of this problem for homogeneous transactions is equivalent to the classic Graph Vertex Coloring Problem, yet show that the heterogeneous case is more complex. We discuss the practical implications of these results. |

Moreover, the proliferation of data analysis models in healthcare institutions necessitates the decentralization and restorability of medical record data. It is imperative that user medical data collected from these systems can be easily analyzed and utilized even years after collection, without the risk of data loss due to numerous factors. Additionally, medical information must be authorized by the data owner, granting patients the right to accept or decline data usage requests from medical research agencies. In response, we propose an innovative solution for implementing a decentralized system utilizing an EVM-compatible blockchain and IPFS for decentralized storage. To ensure privacy and control, we employ Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE), a cryptographic authorized method, within the medical data marketplace. Our proposed architecture significantly reduces costs associated with granting read access to healthcare research agencies by minimizing the encryption and decryption time of stored records. Furthermore, it empowers users with enhanced control over their health data through tamperproof blockchain smart contracts and IPFS, safeguarding the integrity and privacy of their medical records. |

Epistral, an innovative media network that leverages blockchain technology, aims to be the world's first anti-mimetic media curation and consumption network, addressing the core challenges facing today's digital media landscape: unfair treatment of creators and manipulative consumer algorithms, and the complex task of effective regulation. This paper delves into the conceptualization, design, and potential impact of epistral and explores how it embodies McLuhan's and Girard's theories within the realm of blockchain technology and draws from Hayden's critique of democratic representation. The paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities presented by this new network, providing a broader discourse on the future of media consumption, distribution, and regulation. |
|**2024-08-20**|**SCLA: Automated Smart Contract Summarization via LLMs and Semantic Augmentation**|Yingjie Mao et.al.|[2402.04863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04863)| In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain systems, the efficient development and maintenance of smart contracts has become a critical task. Smart contract code summarization can significantly facilitate the maintenance of smart contracts and mitigate their vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, possess the capability to generate code summarizations from code examples embedded in prompts. However, the performance of LLMs in code summarization remains suboptimal compared to fine-tuning-based models (e.g., CodeT5+, CodeBERT). Therefore, we propose SCLA, a framework leveraging LLMs and semantic augmentation to improve code summarization performance. SCLA constructs the smart contract's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract latent semantics, thereby forming a semantically augmented prompt. For evaluation, we utilize a large-scale dataset comprising 40,000 real-world contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that SCLA, with its enhanced prompt, significantly improves the quality of code summarizations. SCLA surpasses other state-of-the-art models (e.g., CodeBERT, CodeT5, and CodeT5+), achieving 37.53% BLEU-4, 52.54% METEOR, 56.97% ROUGE-L, and 63.44% BLEURT, respectively. |

Therefore, evaluating their performance is crucial for investors and policymakers. This work presents a financial evaluation of early-stage firms' performance in 19 cybersecurity sectors using a private-equity dataset from 2010 to 2022 retrieved from Crunchbase. We observe firms, their primary and secondary activities, funding rounds, and pre and post-money valuations. We compare cybersecurity sectors regarding the amount raised over funding rounds and post-money valuations while inferring missing observations. We observe significant investor interest variations across categories, periods, and locations. In particular, we find the average capital raised (valuations) to range from USD 7.24 mln (USD 32.39 mln) for spam filtering to USD 45.46 mln (USD 447.22 mln) for the private cloud sector. Next, we assume a log process for returns computed from post-money valuations and estimate the expected returns, systematic and specific risks, and risk-adjusted returns of investments in early-stage firms belonging to cybersecurity sectors. Again, we observe substantial performance variations with annualized expected returns ranging from 9.72\% for privacy to 177.27\% for the blockchain sector. Finally, we show that overall, the cybersecurity industry performance is on par with previous results found in private equity. Our results shed light on the performance of cybersecurity investments and, thus, on investors' expectations about cybersecurity. |

What would be their rates of return for each asset? This paper focuses on the liquidity difference between the two fundraising methods. I build a three-period model of an entrepreneur, two types of investors, and users. Some investors have unforeseen liquidity needs in the middle period that can only be met with tokens. The entrepreneur obtains higher payoff by issuing tokens instead of equity, and the payoff difference increases with investors risk-aversion and need for liquidity in the middle period, as well as the depth of the token market. |
|**2024-02-07**|**No Transaction Fees? No Problem! Achieving Fairness in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Sankarshan Damle et.al.|[2402.04634](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04634)| The recently proposed Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM) literature studies the strategic interaction between the miner of a block and the transaction creators (or users) in a blockchain. In a TFM, the miner includes transactions that maximize its utility while users submit fees for a slot in the block. The existing TFM literature focuses on satisfying standard incentive properties -- which may limit widespread adoption. We argue that a TFM is "fair" to the transaction creators if it satisfies specific notions, namely Zero-fee Transaction Inclusion and Monotonicity. First, we prove that one generally cannot ensure both these properties and prevent a miner's strategic manipulation. We also show that existing TFMs either do not satisfy these notions or do so at a high cost to the miners' utility. As such, we introduce a novel TFM using on-chain randomness -- rTFM. We prove that rTFM guarantees incentive compatibility for miners and users while satisfying our novel fairness constraints. |
|**2024-02-07**|**Minimizing Block Incentive Volatility Through Verkle Tree-Based Dynamic Transaction Storage**|Xiongfei Zhao et.al.|[2402.04533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04533)| Transaction fees are a crucial revenue source for miners in public and consortium blockchains. However, while public blockchains have additional revenue streams, transaction fees serve as the primary income for miners in consortium blockchains formed by various financial institutions. These miners allocate different levels of computing resources to process transactions and earn corresponding fees. Nonetheless, relying solely on transaction fees can lead to significant volatility and encourage non-standard mining behaviors, thereby posing threats to the blockchain's security and integrity. Despite previous attempts to mitigate the impact of transaction fees on illicit mining behaviors, a comprehensive solution to this vulnerability is yet to be established. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies to effectively minimize block incentive volatility. Our solution implements a Verkle tree-based storage mechanism to reduce bandwidth consumption. Moreover, to configure the DTS strategies, we evaluate several optimization algorithms and formulate the challenge as a Vehicle Routing Problem. Our experiments conducted using historical transactions from Bitcoin and remittance data from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reveal that the strategy focusing on time-based transaction incorporation priority, while excluding a designated space for small-fee transactions, as discovered by the gradient-based optimizer algorithm, proves most effective in reducing volatility. Hence, the DTS strategy can sustain stable block incentives irrespective of transaction types or user bidding behavior. Furthermore, the inclusion of higher-fee transactions, often smaller in size, can alleviate propagation delays and the occurrence of forks. |
|**2024-07-25**|**Decentralized Blockchain-based Robust Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandit**|Mengfan Xu et.al.|[2402.04417](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04417)| We study a robust, i.e. in presence of malicious participants, multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem where multiple participants are distributed on a fully decentralized blockchain, with the possibility of some being malicious. The rewards of arms are homogeneous among the honest participants, following time-invariant stochastic distributions, which are revealed to the participants only when certain conditions are met to ensure that the coordination mechanism is secure enough. The coordination mechanism's objective is to efficiently ensure the cumulative rewards gained by the honest participants are maximized. To this end, we are the first to incorporate advanced techniques from blockchains, as well as novel mechanisms, into such a cooperative decision making framework to design optimal strategies for honest participants. This framework allows various malicious behaviors and the maintenance of security and participant privacy. More specifically, we select a pool of validators who communicate to all participants, design a new consensus mechanism based on digital signatures for these validators, invent a UCB-based strategy that requires less information from participants through secure multi-party computation, and design the chain-participant interaction and an incentive mechanism to encourage participants' participation. Notably, we are the first to prove the theoretical regret of the proposed algorithm and claim its optimality. Unlike existing work that integrates blockchains with learning problems such as federated learning which mainly focuses on optimality via computational experiments, we demonstrate that the regret of honest participants is upper bounded by $\log{T}$ under certain assumptions. The regret bound is consistent with the multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem, both without malicious participants and with purely Byzantine attacks which do not affect the entire system. |
|**2024-02-06**|**Merkle Trees in Blockchain: A Study of Collision Probability and Security Implications**|Oleksandr Kuznetsov et.al.|[2402.04367](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04367)| In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring the integrity and security of data is paramount. This study delves into the security aspects of Merkle Trees, a fundamental component in blockchain architectures, such as Ethereum. We critically examine the susceptibility of Merkle Trees to hash collisions, a potential vulnerability that poses significant risks to data security within blockchain systems. Despite their widespread application, the collision resistance of Merkle Trees and their robustness against preimage attacks have not been thoroughly investigated, leading to a notable gap in the comprehensive understanding of blockchain security mechanisms. Our research endeavors to bridge this gap through a meticulous blend of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. We scrutinize the probability of root collisions in Merkle Trees, considering various factors such as hash length and path length within the tree. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the increase in path length and the heightened probability of root collisions, thereby underscoring potential security vulnerabilities. Conversely, we observe that an increase in hash length significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions, highlighting its critical role in fortifying security. The insights garnered from our research offer valuable guidance for blockchain developers and researchers, aiming to bolster the security and operational efficacy of blockchain-based systems. |

We summarize the features of CEXs and DEXs and propose 4 exchange models that govern the operations of exchanges in different type, allowing for the classification of any exchange into one of these predefined models. Our research also includes an empirical analysis of traders' behavior in exchanges of the 4 types of models. On DEX of Virtual Automated Market Making (VAMM) Model, open interest on short and long positions exert effect on price volatility in opposite direction, attributable to VAMM's price formation mechanism. In the DEXs with Oracle Pricing Model, we observed a distinct asymmetry in trader behavior between buyers and sellers. Such asymmetry might stem from uninformed traders reacting more strongly to positive news than to negative, leading to a tendency to accumulate long positions. This study sheds light on the potential risks and advantages of using perpetual future contracts within the DeFi space while provides mathematical basis and empirical insights based on which future theoretical works can be configurated, offering crucial insights into the rapidly evolving world of blockchain-based financial instruments. |

Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal. |

However, the current approaches to data verification in blockchain systems, particularly in Ethereum, face challenges in terms of efficiency and computational overhead. The traditional use of Merkle Trees and cryptographic hash functions, while effective, leads to significant resource consumption, especially for large datasets. This highlights a gap in existing research: the need for more efficient methods of data verification in blockchain networks. Our study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative aggregation scheme for Zero-Knowledge Proofs within the structure of Merkle Trees. We develop a system that significantly reduces the size of the proof and the computational resources needed for its generation and verification. Our approach represents a paradigm shift in blockchain data verification, balancing security with efficiency. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using real Ethereum block data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate a drastic reduction in proof size and computational requirements compared to traditional methods, making the verification process more efficient and economically viable. Our contribution fills a critical research void, offering a scalable and secure solution for blockchain data verification. The implications of our work are far-reaching, enhancing the overall performance and adaptability of blockchain technology in various applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management. |

By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents within a multi-agent system, these systems can tackle complex tasks through collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems.

|**2024-02-05**|**A security framework for Ethereum smart contracts**|Antonio López Vivar et.al.|[2402.03555](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03555)| The use of blockchain and smart contracts have not stopped growing in recent years. Like all software that begins to expand its use, it is also beginning to be targeted by hackers who will try to exploit vulnerabilities in both the underlying technology and the smart contract code itself. While many tools already exist for analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the heterogeneity and variety of approaches and differences in providing the analysis data makes the learning curve for the smart contract developer steep. In this article the authors present ESAF (Ethereum Security Analysis Framework), a framework for analysis of smart contracts that aims to unify and facilitate the task of analyzing smart contract vulnerabilities which can be used as a persistent security monitoring tool for a set of target contracts as well as a classic vulnerability analysis tool among other uses. |
|**2024-05-29**|**Semitopology: distributed collaborative action via topology, algebra, and logic**|Murdoch J. Gabbay et.al.|[2402.03253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03253)| We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open.   The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing.   This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems. |
|**2024-06-19**|**Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation**|Lei Yang et.al.|[2402.02668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02668)| Set reconciliation, where two parties hold fixed-length bit strings and run a protocol to learn the strings they are missing from each other, is a fundamental task in many distributed systems. We present Rateless Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (Rateless IBLT), the first set reconciliation protocol, to the best of our knowledge, that achieves low computation cost and near-optimal communication cost across a wide range of scenarios: set differences of one to millions, bit strings of a few bytes to megabytes, and workloads injected by potential adversaries. Rateless IBLT is based on a novel encoder that incrementally encodes the set difference into an infinite stream of coded symbols, resembling rateless error-correcting codes. We compare Rateless IBLT with state-of-the-art set reconciliation schemes and demonstrate significant improvements. Rateless IBLT achieves 3--4x lower communication cost than non-rateless schemes with similar computation cost, and 2--2000x lower computation cost than schemes with similar communication cost. We show the real-world benefits of Rateless IBLT by applying it to synchronize the state of the Ethereum blockchain, and demonstrate 5.6x lower end-to-end completion time and 4.4x lower communication cost compared to the system used in production. |

While previous studies have posited a prohibitive cost for such attacks, we show that this cost may be dramatically reduced (to approximately \$125), thereby increasing the likelihood of these attacks. To this end, we introduce Bribe & Fork, a modified bribing attack that leverages the threat of a so-called feather fork which we analyze with a novel formal model for the mining game with forking. We empirically analyze historical data of some real-world blockchain implementations to evaluate the scale of this cost reduction. Our findings shed more light on the potential vulnerability of PCNs and highlight the need for robust solutions. |

Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems or augmented reality. One of the latest technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain, which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability, accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges. Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it. Finally, after a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry developments. |

Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00922)| Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency, redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges. Furthermore, extensive comparisons are provided on the characteristics and performance of the most promising post-quantum public-key encryption and digital signature schemes for blockchains. Thus, this article seeks to provide a broad view and useful guidelines on post-quantum blockchain security to future blockchain researchers and developers. |

Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00709)| In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios. |

Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[2402.00687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00687)| The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications. |

Each of these blockchains provides an open ledger that anyone can read from and write to. In this multi-chain world, an important question emerges: how can we build a more secure overlay blockchain by reading from and writing to a given set of blockchains? Drawing an analogy with switching circuits, we approach the problem by defining two basic compositional operations between blockchains, serial and triangular compositions, and use these operations as building blocks to construct general overlay blockchains. Under the partially synchronous setting, we have the following results: 1) the serial composition, between two blockchains, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if at least one of the two underlay blockchains is safe and that is live if both of them are live; 2) the triangular composition between three blockchains, akin to parallel composition of switching circuits, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if all underlay blockchains are safe and that is live if over half of them are live; 3) repeated composition of these two basic operations can yield all possible tradeoffs of safety and liveness for an overlay blockchain built on arbitrary number of underlay chains. The results are also extended to the synchronous setting. |

Nevertheless, the exchange of model updates and gradients in this architecture provides new attack surfaces for malicious users of the network which may jeopardize the model performance and user and data privacy. For this reason, one of the main motivations for decentralized federated learning is to eliminate server-related threats by removing the server from the network and compensating for it through technologies such as blockchain. However, this advantage comes at the cost of challenging the system with new privacy threats. Thus, performing a thorough security analysis in this new paradigm is necessary. This survey studies possible variations of threats and adversaries in decentralized federated learning and overviews the potential defense mechanisms. Trustability and verifiability of decentralized federated learning are also considered in this study. |

As quantum computing emerges, conventional public key cryptography faces potential vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's robustness, we employ post-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for generating pseudo-random sequences. Given the computational intensity of this approach and associated on-chain gas costs, we propose a hybrid architecture of VRF system where on-chain and off-chain can communicate in a scalable and secure way. To ensure the validity and integrity of the off-chain computations (e.g., Ring-LWE encryption), we employ a quantum-secure linkable ring signature scheme on NTRU lattice and also delegated key generation (DKG) with a secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). Our decentralized VRF employs multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), ensuring the collective efforts of enhanced randomness and security. We show the security and privacy advantages of our proposed VRF model with the approximated estimation of overall temporal and spatial complexities. We also evaluate our VRF MPC model's entropy and outline its Solidity smart contract integration. This research also provides a method to produce and verify the VRF output's proof, optimal for scenarios necessitating randomness and validation. Lastly, using NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the commendable result with a 97.73% overall pass rate on 11 standard tests and 0.5459 of average p-value for the total 176 tests. |
|**2024-01-31**|**BAR Nash Equilibrium and Application to Blockchain Design**|Maxime Reynouard et.al.|[2401.16856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16856)| This paper presents a novel solution concept, called BAR Nash Equilibrium (BARNE) and apply it to analyse the Verifier's dilemma, a fundamental problem in blockchain. Our solution concept adapts the Nash equilibrium (NE) to accommodate interactions among Byzantine, altruistic and rational agents, which became known as the BAR setting in the literature. We prove the existence of BARNE in a large class of games and introduce two natural refinements, global and local stability. Using this equilibrium and its refinement, we analyse the free-rider problem in the context of byzantine consensus. We demonstrate that by incorporating fines and forced errors into a standard quorum-based blockchain protocol, we can effectively reestablish honest behavior as a globally stable BARNE. |
|**2024-09-09**|**Game of Coding: Beyond Honest-Majority Assumptions**|Hanzaleh Akbari Nodehi et.al.|[2401.16643](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16643)| Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversaries and the data collector (decoder) have respective utility functions to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2 for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions. |

However, few studies exist on its implementation designs or underlying risks. The liquid staking protocols allow for earning staking rewards without the disadvantage of locking the capital at the validators. Yet, they are seen by some as a threat to the Proof-of-Stake blockchain security.   This paper is the first work that classifies liquid staking implementations. It analyzes the historical performance of major liquid staking tokens in comparison to the traditional staking for the largest Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Furthermore, the research investigates the impact of centralization, maximum extractable value and the migration of Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake on the tokens' performance. Examining the tracking error of the liquid stacking providers to the staking rewards shows that they are persistent and cannot be explained by macro-variables of the currency, such as the variance or return. |

In addition, blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger which can provide support for running arbitrary logic thanks to smart contracts. These facts can lead to harness smart contracts on blockchain as the basis for a decentralized, autonomous, and resilient orchestrator for the resources in the fog. However, the potentially vast amount of geographically distributed fog nodes may threaten the feasibility of the orchestration. On the other hand, fog nodes can exhibit highly dynamic workloads which may result in the orchestrator redistributing the services among them. Thus, there is also a need to dynamically support the network connections to those services independently of their location. Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be integrated within the orchestrator to carry out a seamless service management. To tackle both aforementioned issues, the S-HIDRA architecture is proposed. It integrates SDN support within a blockchain-based orchestrator of container-based services for fog environments, in order to provide low network latency and high service availability. Also, a domain-based architecture is outlined \marev{as potential scenario} to address the geographic distributed nature of fog environments. Results obtained from a proof-of-concept implementation assess the required functionality for S-HIDRA. |

Pilotfish allows each validator to employ multiple machines, named ExecutionWorkers, under its control to scale its execution layer. Given a sufficiently parallelizable and compute-intensive load, the number of transactions that the validator can execute increases linearly with the number of ExecutionWorkers at its disposal. In addition, Pilotfish maintains the consistency of the state, even when many validators experience simultaneous machine failures. This is possible due to the meticulous co-design of our crash-recovery protocol which leverages the existing fault tolerance in the blockchain's consensus mechanism. Finally, Pilotfish can also be seen as the first distributed deterministic execution engine that provides support for dynamic reads as transactions are not required to provide a fully accurate read and write set. This loosening of requirements would normally reduce the parallelizability available by blocking write-after-write conflicts, but our novel versioned-queues scheduling algorithm circumvents this by exploiting the lazy recovery property of Pilotfish, which only persists consistent state and re-executes any optimistic steps taken before the crash. In order to prove our claims we implemented the common path of Pilotfish with support for the MoveVM and evaluated it against the parallel execution MoveVM of Sui. Our results show that Pilotfish provides good scalability up to 8 ExecutionWorkers for a variety of workloads. In computationally-heavy workloads, Pilotfish's scalability is linear. |

Alcaide et.al.|[2401.16028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16028)| In Spain, quantity surveyors are entitled to carry out official cadastral surveys, attestations, and certificate issuing according to a well-defined professional code. Official Associations of Quantity Surveyors and Technical Architects (COAAT) are responsible for endorsing the documentation related to actions performed on buildings. An e-platform that enables immutability, traceability, and a unique property record among all the Spanish COAATs, with an affordable cost, is essential to streamline the involved processes.   The blockchain technology and smart contracts have recently emerged as promising solutions for e-government services due to the inherent features provided by the technology. In this paper, we identify the design goals and propose a blockchain-based e-government system for the electronic management of the documentation generated, submitted, and validated by the Spanish COAATs, namely, the COAATChain. The proposal has been deployed and evaluated on the Binance testnet blockchain, in order to assess its affordability. |
|**2024-01-29**|**Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Federated Unlearning**|Yijing Lin et.al.|[2401.15917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15917)| Federated unlearning is a promising paradigm for protecting the data ownership of distributed clients. It allows central servers to remove historical data effects within the machine learning model as well as address the "right to be forgotten" issue in federated learning. However, existing works require central servers to retain the historical model parameters from distributed clients, such that allows the central server to utilize these parameters for further training even, after the clients exit the training process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new blockchain-enabled trustworthy federated unlearning framework. We first design a proof of federated unlearning protocol, which utilizes the Chameleon hash function to verify data removal and eliminate the data contributions stored in other clients' models. Then, an adaptive contribution-based retraining mechanism is developed to reduce the computational overhead and significantly improve the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a better data removal effect than the state-of-the-art frameworks, marking a significant stride towards trustworthy federated unlearning. |
|**2024-01-28**|**Exploring the Impact of Blockchain, AI, and ML on Financial Accounting Efficiency and Transformation**|Vijaya Kanaparthi et.al.|[2401.15715](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15715)| Continuous innovations profoundly impact the financial and commercial domains, reshaping conventional business practices. Among the disruptive forces, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain technology stand out prominently. This study aims to evaluate the integration of blockchain, AI, and ML within financial accounting practices. It suggests a potential revolutionary impact on financial accounting through the adoption of blockchain technology and ML, promising reduced accounting expenses, heightened precision, real-time financial reporting capabilities, and expeditious auditing processes. AI's role in automating repetitive financial accounting tasks assists organizations in circumventing the need for additional staff, thereby minimizing associated costs. Consequently, to bolster efficiency, businesses are increasingly embracing blockchain technology and AI applications in their financial accounting operations. |
|**2024-01-28**|**Generative AI-enabled Blockchain Networks: Fundamentals, Applications, and Case Study**|Cong T. Nguyen et.al.|[2401.15625](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15625)| Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address critical challenges of blockchain technology, including scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems. |
|**2024-01-31**|**Unsealing the secrets of blockchain consensus: A systematic comparison of the formal security of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake**|Iván Abellán Álvarez et.al.|[2401.14527](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14527)| With the increasing adoption of decentralized information systems based on a variety of permissionless blockchain networks, the choice of consensus mechanism is at the core of many controversial discussions. Ethereum's recent transition from (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS)-based consensus has further fueled the debate on which mechanism is more favorable. While the aspects of energy consumption and degree of (de-)centralization are often emphasized in the public discourse, seminal research has also shed light on the formal security aspects of both approaches individually. However, related work has not yet comprehensively structured the knowledge about the security properties of PoW and PoS. Rather, it has focused on in-depth analyses of specific protocols or high-level comparative reviews covering a broad range of consensus mechanisms. To fill this gap and unravel the commonalities and discrepancies between the formal security properties of PoW- and PoS-based consensus, we conduct a systematic literature review over 26 research articles. Our findings indicate that PoW-based consensus with the longest chain rule provides the strongest formal security guarantees. Nonetheless, PoS can achieve similar guarantees when addressing its more pronounced tradeoff between safety and liveness through hybrid approaches. |

Although Web 3.0 is undoubtedly an essential component of the future Internet, it currently faces critical challenges, including decentralized data collection and management. To overcome these challenges, blockchain has emerged as one of the core technologies for the future development of Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based information management framework, namely Smart Blockchain-based Web, to manage information in Web 3.0 effectively, enhance the security and privacy of users data, bring additional profits, and incentivize users to contribute information to the websites. Particularly, SBW utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage the decentralized data collection process for Web 3.0 effectively. Moreover, in this framework, we develop an effective consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Stake to reward the user's information contribution and conduct game theoretical analysis to analyze the users behavior in the considered system. Additionally, we conduct simulations to assess the performance of SBW and investigate the impact of critical parameters on information contribution. The findings confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our proposed consensus mechanism can incentivize the nodes and users to contribute more information to our systems. |
|**2024-01-31**|**CHIRON: Accelerating Node Synchronization without Security Trade-offs in Distributed Ledgers**|Ray Neiheiser et.al.|[2401.14278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14278)| Blockchain performance has historically faced challenges posed by the throughput limitations of consensus algorithms. Recent breakthroughs in research have successfully alleviated these constraints by introducing a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution. The move toward independent optimization of the consensus layer has shifted attention to the execution layer.   While concurrent transaction execution is a promising solution for increasing throughput, practical challenges persist. Its effectiveness varies based on the workloads, and the associated increased hardware requirements raise concerns about undesirable centralization. This increased requirement results in full nodes and stragglers synchronizing from signed checkpoints, decreasing the trustless nature of blockchain systems.   In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Chiron, a system designed to extract execution hints for the acceleration of straggling and full nodes. Notably, Chiron achieves this without compromising the security of the system or introducing overhead on the critical path of consensus. Evaluation results demonstrate a notable speedup of up to 30%, effectively addressing the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment. The quantification of this speedup is achieved through realistic blockchain benchmarks derived from a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum and Solana workloads, constituting an independent contribution. |

To ensure successful cooperation, road users must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore, vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or misbehaving nodes, while also considering inherent constraints of the wireless medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading with minimal overhead. To achieve this, we employ blockchain techniques, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based mechanics. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the VEE extension in overcoming the challenges posed by the distributed and opportunistic nature of wireless vehicular communications. |

However, risk management frameworks, including regulatory ones, have been largely absent. In this paper, we address the critical question of measuring and managing risk in stablecoin protocols, which operate on public blockchain infrastructure. The on-chain environment makes it possible to monitor risk and automate its management via transparent smart-contracts in real-time. We propose two risk metrics covering capitalization and liquidity of stablecoin protocols. We then explore in a case-study type analysis how our risk management framework can be applied to DAI, the biggest decentralized stablecoin by market capitalisation to-date, governed by MakerDAO. Based on our findings, we recommend that the protocol explores implementing automatic capital buffer adjustments and dynamic maturity gap matching. Our analysis demonstrates the practical benefits for scalable (prudential) risk management stemming from real-time availability of high-quality, granular, tamper-resistant on-chain data in the digital asset space. We name this approach Crypto Asset-Liability Management (CALM). |
|**2024-01-24**|**Designing Redistribution Mechanisms for Reducing Transaction Fees in Blockchains**|Sankarshan Damle et.al.|[2401.13262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13262)| Blockchains deploy Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to determine which user transactions to include in blocks and determine their payments (i.e., transaction fees). Increasing demand and scarce block resources have led to high user transaction fees. As these blockchains are a public resource, it may be preferable to reduce these transaction fees. To this end, we introduce Transaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs) -- redistributing VCG payments collected from such TFM as rebates to minimize transaction fees. Classic redistribution mechanisms (RMs) achieve this while ensuring Allocative Efficiency (AE) and User Incentive Compatibility (UIC). Our first result shows the non-triviality of applying RM in TFMs. More concretely, we prove that it is impossible to reduce transaction fees when (i) transactions that are not confirmed do not receive rebates and (ii) the miner can strategically manipulate the mechanism. Driven by this, we propose \emph{Robust} TFRM (\textsf{R-TFRM}): a mechanism that compromises on an honest miner's individual rationality to guarantee strictly positive rebates to the users. We then introduce \emph{robust} and \emph{rational} TFRM (\textsf{R} $^2$ \textsf{-TFRM}) that uses trusted on-chain randomness that additionally guarantees miner's individual rationality (in expectation) and strictly positive rebates. Our results show that TFRMs provide a promising new direction for reducing transaction fees in public blockchains. |

Such information is typically not directly observed but plays a key role in the learning task performance. In turn, lack of time dimension in knowledge encoding mechanisms for time-dependent data leads to frequent model updates, poor learning performance, and, as a result, subpar decision-making. Here we propose a new approach to a time-aware knowledge representation mechanism that notably focuses on implicit time-dependent topological information along multiple geometric dimensions. In particular, we propose a new approach, named \textit{Temporal MultiPersistence} (TMP), which produces multidimensional topological fingerprints of the data by using the existing single parameter topological summaries. The main idea behind TMP is to merge the two newest directions in topological representation learning, that is, multi-persistence which simultaneously describes data shape evolution along multiple key parameters, and zigzag persistence to enable us to extract the most salient data shape information over time. We derive theoretical guarantees of TMP vectorizations and show its utility, in application to forecasting on benchmark traffic flow, Ethereum blockchain, and electrocardiogram datasets, demonstrating the competitive performance, especially, in scenarios of limited data records. In addition, our TMP method improves the computational efficiency of the state-of-the-art multipersistence summaries up to 59.5 times. |
|**2024-01-22**|**Monitoring the Future of Smart Contracts**|Margarita Capretto et.al.|[2401.12093](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12093)| Blockchains are decentralized systems that provide trustable execution guarantees. Smart contracts are programs written in specialized programming languages running on blockchains that govern how tokens and cryptocurrency are sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke other smart contracts during the execution of transactions always initiated by external users.   Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified, so techniques like runtime verification are very appealing for improving their reliability. However, the conventional model of computation of smart contracts is transactional: once operations commit, their effects are permanent and cannot be undone.   In this paper, we proposed the concept of future monitors which allows monitors to remain waiting for future transactions to occur before committing or aborting. This is inspired by optimistic rollups, which are modern blockchain implementations that increase efficiency (and reduce cost) by delaying transaction effects. We exploit this delay to propose a model of computation that allows (bounded) future monitors. We show our monitors correct respect of legacy transactions, how they implement future bounded monitors and how they guarantee progress. We illustrate the use of future bounded monitors to implement correctly multi-transaction flash loans. |

Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about donors' motivations in these charity fundraisers, potentially resulting in a negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of perceived strategic generosity) and based on an individual's social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT 're-listers' experience significant penalties in the market regarding the prices they can command for their other NFTs, particularly among those who are more socially exposed. Finally, we report the results of a scenario-based online experiment, which again support our findings, highlighting that the re-listing a charity NFT for sale at a profit leads others to perceive their initial donation as strategic generosity and reduces those others' willingness to purchase NFTs from the donor. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly. |

This family exhibits two interesting benefits, if used as a platform for large-scale, instant, retail payment systems, such as CBDCs: Technically, the solution offers state-of-the-art guarantees of fault-tolerance and integrity, while providing a latency and throughput comparable to centralized systems; from a business perspective, the solution perfectly suits the 3-tier architecture of the current banking ecosystem (central banks / commercial banks / retail users), assigning a pivotal and peculiar role to the members of each tier. Furthermore, the cryptographic privacy of payments for retail users -- typical of PCNs such as the public Lightning Network -- is largely (possibly fully) retained. We study the system by simulating a scaled-down version of a hypothetical European CBDC, exploring the trade-offs among liquidity locked by market operators, payment success rate, throughput, latency, and load on the underpinning blockchain. |

Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications.   We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts.   zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests, zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.   zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains. It allows billions of users to produce \textit{verifiable digital content leveraging their existing digital identities}, e.g., email address. For example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any party.   We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. |
|**2024-01-21**|**Understanding the Security Risks of Decentralized Exchanges by Uncovering Unfair Trades in the Wild**|Jiaqi Chen et.al.|[2401.11547](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11547)| DEX, or decentralized exchange, is a prominent class of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on blockchains, attracting a total locked value worth tens of billions of USD today.   This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study that uncovers unfair trades on popular DEX services on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By joining and analyzing 60 million transactions, we find 671,400 unfair trades on all six measured DEXes, including Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve. Out of these unfair trades, we attribute 55,000 instances, with high confidence, to token thefts that cause a value loss of more than 3.88 million USD. Furthermore, the measurement study uncovers previously unknown causes of extractable value and real-world adaptive strategies to these causes. Finally, we propose countermeasures to redesign secure DEX protocols and to harden deployed services against the discovered security risks. |

However, vulnerabilities in this mission-critical code have led to significant exploitations and asset losses. Thorough automated security analysis of smart contracts is thus imperative. This paper introduces LLM4Fuzz to optimize automated smart contract security analysis by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to intelligently guide and prioritize fuzzing campaigns. While traditional fuzzing suffers from low efficiency in exploring the vast state space, LLM4Fuzz employs LLMs to direct fuzzers towards high-value code regions and input sequences more likely to trigger vulnerabilities. Additionally, LLM4Fuzz can leverage LLMs to guide fuzzers based on user-defined invariants, reducing blind exploration overhead. Evaluations of LLM4Fuzz on real-world DeFi projects show substantial gains in efficiency, coverage, and vulnerability detection compared to baseline fuzzing. LLM4Fuzz also uncovered five critical vulnerabilities that can lead to a loss of more than $247k. |

Depending on individual interests, wallets explore and purchase NFTs in one or more image collections. Among many potential factors of shaping purchase trajectories, this paper specifically examines how visual similarities between collections affect wallets' explorations. Our model shows that wallets' explorations are not random but tend to favor collections having similar visual features to their previous purchases. The model also predicts the extent to which the next collection is close to the most recent collection of purchases with respect to visual features. These results are expected to enhance and support recommendation systems for the NFT market. |

Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the present supply chain market today includes various companies involving integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority, intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and IoT. |

Modern information systems are heterogeneous in nature and have an inherent security vulnerability, which is susceptible to data interception and data modification due to unsecured communication data pipelines between connected endpoints. This re-search article presents a blockchain-based model for securing data pipelines in a heterogeneous information system using an integrated multi-hazard early warning system (MHEWS) as a case study. The proposed model utilizes the inherent security features of blockchain technology to address the security and privacy concerns that arise in data pipelines. The model is designed to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in a decentralized manner. The model is evaluated in a hybrid environment using a prototype implementation and simulation experiments with outcomes that demonstrate advantages over traditional approaches for a tamper-proof and immutable data pipeline for data authenticity and integrity using a confidential ledger. |

This gap underlines the pressing necessity for a protocol that not only enables seamless cross-platform messaging but also allows direct messaging to wallet addresses, fostering interoperability and privacy across diverse platforms. SendingNetwork addresses this need by creating a reliable and secure decentralized communication network, targeting essential challenges like privacy protection, scalability, efficiency, and composability. Central to our approach is the incorporation of edge computing to form an adaptive relay network with the modular libp2p library. We introduce a dynamic group chat encryption mechanism based on the Double Ratchet algorithm for secure communication and propose a Delegation scheme for efficient message processing in large group chats, enhancing both resilience and scalability. Our theoretical analyses affirm the Delegation scheme's superior performance. To bolster system stability and encourage node participation, we integrate two innovative consensus mechanisms: "Proof of Relay" for validating message relay workload based on the novel KZG commitment, and "Proof of Availability" for ensuring network consistency and managing incentives through Verkle trees. Our whitepaper details the network's key components and architecture, concluding with a roadmap and a preview of future enhancements to SendingNetwork. |

PoW blockchain faces the problem of centralization due to the formation of mining pools, where miners mine blocks as a group and distribute rewards. The rationale is to reduce the risk (variance) in reward while obtaining the same expected block reward. In this work, we address the problem of centralization due to mining pools in PoW blockchain. We propose a two-player game between the new miner joining the system and the PoW blockchain system.   We model the utility for the incoming miner as a combination of (i) expected block reward, (ii) risk, and (iii) cost of switching between different mining pools. With this utility structure, we analyze the equilibrium strategy of the incoming miner for different BRMs: (a) memoryless -- block reward is history independent (e.g., Bitcoin) (b) retentive: block reward is history-dependent (e.g., Fruitchains). For memoryless BRMs, we show that depending on the coefficient of switching cost $c$, the protocol is decentralized when $c = 0$ and centralized when $c > \underline{c}$ . In addition, we show the impossibility of constructing a memoryless BRM where solo mining gives a higher payoff than forming/joining mining pools. While retentive BRM in Fruitchains reduces risk in solo mining, the equilibrium strategy for incoming miners is still to join mining pools, leading to centralization. We then propose our novel retentive BRM -- \textsf{Decent-BRM}. We show that under \textsf{Decent-BRM}, incoming miners obtain higher utility in solo mining than joining mining pools. Therefore, no mining pools are formed, and the Pow blockchain using \textsf{Decent-BRM} is decentralized. |

Most of the existing work on remote integrity checking focuses on static archival data and therefore cannot be applied to cases where dynamic data updates are more common. Additionally, existing auditing schemes suffer from performance bottlenecks and scalability issues. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel dynamic auditing scheme for centralized cloud environments leveraging an enhanced version of the B-tree. Our proposed scheme achieves the immutable characteristic of a decentralized system (i.e., blockchain technology) while effectively addressing the synchronization and performance challenges of such systems. Unlike other static auditing schemes, our scheme supports dynamic insert, update, and delete operations. Also, by leveraging an enhanced B-tree, our scheme maintains a balanced tree after any alteration to a certain file, improving performance significantly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms both traditional Merkle Hash Tree-based centralized auditing and decentralized blockchain-based auditing schemes in terms of block modifications (e.g., insert, delete, update), block retrieval, and data verification time. |

Macpherson et.al.|[2401.08302](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08302)| We study a new "laminated" queueing model for orders on batched trading venues such as decentralised exchanges. The model aims to capture and generalise transaction queueing infrastructure that has arisen to organise MEV activity on public blockchains such as Ethereum, providing convenient channels for sophisticated agents to extract value by acting on end-user order flow by performing arbitrage and related HFT activities. In our model, market orders are interspersed with orders created by arbitrageurs that under idealised conditions reset the marginal price to a global equilibrium between each trade, improving predictability of execution for liquidity traders.   If an arbitrageur has a chance to land multiple opportunities in a row, he may attempt to manipulate the execution price of the intervening market order by a probabilistic blind sandwiching strategy. To study how bad this manipulation can get, we introduce and bound a price manipulation coefficient that measures the deviation from global equilibrium of local pricing quoted by a rational arbitrageur. We exhibit cases in which this coefficient is well approximated by a "zeta value' with interpretable and empirically measurable parameters. |
|**2024-01-15**|**Playing the MEV Game on a First-Come-First-Served Blockchain**|Burak Öz et.al.|[2401.07992](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07992)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) searching has gained prominence on the Ethereum blockchain since the surge in Decentralized Finance activities. In Ethereum, MEV extraction primarily hinges on fee payments to block proposers. However, in First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) blockchain networks, the focus shifts to latency optimizations, akin to High-Frequency Trading in Traditional Finance. This paper illustrates the dynamics of the MEV extraction game in an FCFS network, specifically Algorand. We introduce an arbitrage detection algorithm tailored to the unique time constraints of FCFS networks and assess its effectiveness. Additionally, our experiments investigate potential optimizations in Algorand's network layer to secure optimal execution positions.   Our analysis reveals that while the states of relevant trading pools are updated approximately every six blocks on median, pursuing MEV at the block state level is not viable on Algorand, as arbitrage opportunities are typically executed within the blocks they appear. Our algorithm's performance under varying time constraints underscores the importance of timing in arbitrage discovery. Furthermore, our network-level experiments identify critical transaction prioritization strategies for Algorand's FCFS network. Key among these is reducing latency in connections with relays that are well-connected to high-staked proposers. |

This paper thoroughly compares and analyzes two blockchain-based decentralized storage networks (DSNs), which are crucial foundations for DApp and blockchain ecosystems. The study examines their respective mechanisms for data persistence, strategies for enforcing data retention, and token economics. In addition to delving into technical details, the suitability of each storage solution for decentralized application development is assessed, taking into consideration network performance, storage costs, and existing use cases. By evaluating these factors, the paper aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these technologies in supporting the desirable properties of truly decentralized blockchain applications. In conclusion, the findings of this research are discussed and synthesized, offering valuable perspectives on the capabilities of these technologies. It sheds light on their potential to facilitate the development of DApps and provides an understanding of the ongoing trends in blockchain development. |

Existing defense mechanisms typically focus on detecting and reacting to malicious transactions executed by attackers that target victim contracts. However, with the emergence of private transaction pools where transactions are sent directly to miners without first appearing in public mempools, current detection tools face significant challenges in identifying attack activities effectively.   Based on the fact that most attack logic rely on deploying one or more intermediate smart contracts as supporting components to the exploitation of victim contracts, in this paper, we propose a new direction for detecting DeFi attacks that focuses on identifying adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions. Our approach allows us to leverage common attack patterns, code semantics and intrinsic characteristics found in malicious smart contracts to build the LookAhead system based on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and a transformer model that is able to effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones, and make just-in-time predictions of potential zero-day attacks. Our contributions are three-fold: First, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of features extracted and constructed from recent contracts deployed on the Ethereum and BSC blockchains. Secondly, we design a condensed representation of smart contract programs called Pruned Semantic-Control Flow Tokenization (PSCFT) and use it to train a combination of ML models that understand the behaviour of malicious codes based on function calls, control flows and other pattern-conforming features. Lastly, we provide the complete implementation of LookAhead and the evaluation of its performance metrics for detecting adversarial contracts. |

In particular, the recently proposed Streamlet protocol provides a surprisingly simple and streamlined consensus approach, which crystallizes years of research in simplifying and improving classical consensus protocols. While the simplicity of Streamlet is a major accomplishment, the protocol lacks certain practical features, such as supporting a stable block proposer, and it makes strong assumptions, such as synchronized clocks and the implicit echoing of all messages. Most importantly, it requires sending $O(N^3)$ messages per block in a network of $N$ nodes, which poses a significant challenge to its application in larger networks. To address these limitations, we introduce Pipelet, a practical streamlined consensus protocol. Pipelet employs the same block-finalization rule as Streamlet, but attains state-of-the-art performance in terms of communication complexity and provides features that are crucial for practical applications, such as clock synchronization and stable block proposers. At the same time, Pipelet retains the simplicity of Streamlet, which presents significant practical advantages, such as ease of implementation and verification. |

|**2024-10-24**|**Send Message to the Future? Blockchain-based Time Machines for Decentralized Reveal of Locked Information**|Zhuolun Li et.al.|[2401.05947](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05947)| Conditional information reveal systems automate the release of information upon meeting specific predefined conditions, such as time or location. This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design, and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a secret sharing scheme with reveal-verifiability, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that "sends messages in the future" with highly accurate decryption times. Notably, the proposed secret sharing scheme applies to other applications requiring verifiability of revealed secret shares. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe. Using real-world election data, we also demonstrate the applicability of this innovative system in e-voting, illustrating its capacity to secure and ensure fair electronic voting processes. |
|**2024-01-11**|**STAKESURE: Proof of Stake Mechanisms with Strong Cryptoeconomic Safety**|Soubhik Deb et.al.|[2401.05797](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05797)| As of July 15, 2023, Ethererum, which is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain [1] has around 410 Billion USD in total assets on chain (popularly referred to as total-value-locked, TVL) but has only 33 Billion USD worth of ETH staked in securing the underlying consensus of the chain [2]. A preliminary analysis might suggest that as the amount staked is far less (11x less) than the value secured, the Ethereum blockchain is insecure and "over-leveraged" in a purely cryptoeconomic sense. In this work, we investigate how Ethereum, or, more generally, any PoS blockchain can be made secure despite this apparent imbalance. Towards that end, we attempt to formalize a model for analyzing the cryptoeconomic safety of PoS blockchain, which separately analyzes the cost-of-corruption, the cost incurred by an attacker, and the profit-from-corruption, the profit gained by an attacker. We derive sharper bounds on profit-from-corruption, as well as new confirmation rules that significantly decrease this upper-bound. We evaluate cost-of-corruption and profit-from-corruption only from the perspective of attacking safety. Finally, we present a new "insurance" mechanism, STAKESURE, for allocating the slashed funds in a PoS system, that has several highly desirable properties: solving common information problem in existing blockchains, creating a mechanism for provably safe bridging, and providing the first sharp solution for automatically adjusting how much economic security is sufficient in a PoS system. Finally, we show that the system satisfies a notion of strong cryptoeconomic safety, which guarantees that no honest transactor ever loses money, and creates a closed system of Karma, which not only ensures that the attacker suffers a loss of funds but also that the harmed parties are sufficiently compensated. |

We also report significant sample-to-sample variations of the distribution of holding times, which can be best characterized as multiscaling, with power-law exponents varying between $0.3$ and $2.5$ depending on bitcoin price regimes. We document significant differences between the distributions of book-to-market and of realized returns, showing that traders obtain far from optimal performance. We also report strong direct qualitative and quantitative evidence of the disposition effect in the Bitcoin Blockchain data. Defining age-dependent transaction flows as the fraction of bitcoins that are traded at a given time and that were born (last traded) at some specific earlier time, we document that the time-averaged transaction flow fraction has a power law dependence as a function of age, with an exponent close to $-1.5$ , a value compatible with priority queuing theory. We document the existence of multifractality on the measure defined as the normalized number of bitcoins exchanged at a given time. |

Just like a double-edged sword, it also inadvertently becomes the safety net and breeding ground for illicit activities. Among them, cryptocurrencies have been prevalently abused to receive illicit income while evading regulations. Despite the continuing efforts to combat illicit activities, there is still a lack of an in-depth understanding regarding the characteristics and dynamics of cryptocurrency abuses on the dark web. In this work, we conduct a multi-dimensional and systematic study to track cryptocurrency-related illicit activities and campaigns on the dark web. We first harvest a dataset of 4,923 cryptocurrency-related onion sites with over 130K pages. Then, we detect and extract the illicit blockchain transactions to characterize the cryptocurrency abuses, targeting features from single/clustered addresses and illicit campaigns. Throughout our study, we have identified 2,564 illicit sites with 1,189 illicit blockchain addresses, which account for 90.8 BTC in revenue. Based on their inner connections, we further identify 66 campaigns behind them. Our exploration suggests that illicit activities on the dark web have strong correlations, which can guide us to identify new illicit blockchain addresses and onions, and raise alarms at the early stage of their deployment. |

This concept seeks to efficiently utilise budgeted staking rewards to attract and sustain liquidity through a risk-structuring engine and incentive allocation strategy, both of which are designed to maximise capital efficiency. The proposed protocol serves the dual objective of: (i) capital creation by attracting risk capital efficiently and maximising its operational utility for intrinsic DeFi applications, thereby asserting sustainability; and (ii) enhancing the adopting blockchain network's economic security by augmenting their staking (PoS) mechanism with a harmonious layer seeking to attract a diversity of digital assets. Finally, the protocol's conceptual framework, as detailed in the appendix, is extended to encompass service fee credits. This extension capitalises on the network's auxiliary services to disperse incentives and attract liquidity, ensuring the network achieves and maintains the critical usage threshold essential for its sustained operational viability and progressive growth. |
|**2024-01-09**|**Expiring Assets in Automated Market Makers**|Kenan Wood et.al.|[2401.04289](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04289)| An automated market maker (AMM) is a state machine that manages pools of assets, allowing parties to buy and sell those assets according to a fixed mathematical formula. AMMs are typically implemented as smart contracts on blockchains, and its prices are kept in line with the overall market price by arbitrage: if the AMM undervalues an asset with respect to the market, an "arbitrageur" can make a risk-free profit by buying just enough of that asset to bring the AMM's price back in line with the market.   AMMs, however, are not designed for assets that expire: that is, assets that cannot be produced or resold after a specified date. As assets approach expiration, arbitrage may not be able to reconcile supply and demand, and the liquidity providers that funded the AMM may have excessive exposure to risk due to rapid price variations.   This paper formally describes the design of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for assets that expire, combining aspects of AMMs and limit-order books. We ensure liveness and market clearance, providing mechanisms for liquidity providers to control their exposure to risk and adjust prices dynamically in response to situations where arbitrage may fail. |

This paper provides an overview of Nigeria's ICT journey, underscoring its central role in sustainable economic prosperity. We explore the potential of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT), revealing the remarkable opportunities on the horizon. We stress the urgency of achieving digital inclusivity, bridging the urban-rural gap, and reducing the technological divide, all of which are critical as Nigeria marks its sixtieth year. We intend to prove the invaluable opportunities of ICT for policymakers, business leaders, and educational institutes as Nigeria looks towards enduring economic development in this digital age. Specifically, we envision a dynamic landscape where emerging technologies are set to redefine industries, supercharge economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for every Nigerian. |

Its integration into the healthcare ecosystem has helped overcome numerous difficulties and constraints faced by healthcare systems. This has been notably demonstrated in the meticulous management of electronic health records (EHR) and their access rights, as well as in its capabilities in terms of security, scalability, flexibility, and interoperability with other systems. This article undertakes the study and analysis of the most commonly adopted approaches in healthcare data management systems using blockchain technology. An evaluation is then conducted based on a set of observed common characteristics, distinguishing one approach from the others. The results of this analysis highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach, thus facilitating the choice of the method best suited to the readers' specific case study. Furthermore, for effective implementation in the context of e-health, we emphasize the existence of crucial challenges, such as the incomplete representation of major stakeholders in the blockchain network, the lack of regulatory flexibility to ensure legal interoperability by country, and the insufficient integration of an official regulatory authority ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards. To address these challenges, it is necessary to establish close collaboration between regulators, technology developers, and healthcare stakeholders. |

M. et.al.|[2401.03552](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03552)| Federated Learning (FL) has recently arisen as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. According to this novel framework, multiple participants train a global model collaboratively, coordinating with a central aggregator without sharing their local data. As FL gains popularity in diverse domains, security, and privacy concerns arise due to the distributed nature of this solution. Therefore, integrating this strategy with Blockchain technology has been consolidated as a preferred choice to ensure the privacy and security of participants.   This paper explores the research efforts carried out by the scientific community to define privacy solutions in scenarios adopting Blockchain-Enabled FL. It comprehensively summarizes the background related to FL and Blockchain, evaluates existing architectures for their integration, and the primary attacks and possible countermeasures to guarantee privacy in this setting. Finally, it reviews the main application scenarios where Blockchain-Enabled FL approaches have been proficiently applied. This survey can help academia and industry practitioners understand which theories and techniques exist to improve the performance of FL through Blockchain to preserve privacy and which are the main challenges and future directions in this novel and still under-explored context. We believe this work provides a novel contribution respect to the previous surveys and is a valuable tool to explore the current landscape, understand perspectives, and pave the way for advancements or improvements in this amalgamation of Blockchain and Federated Learning. |

Successfully detecting anomalies within Blockchain transactions is essential for bolstering trust in digital payments. However, the task of anomaly detection in Blockchain transaction data is challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of illicit transactions. Although several studies have been conducted in the field, a limitation persists: the lack of explanations for the model's predictions. This study seeks to overcome this limitation by integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and anomaly rules into tree-based ensemble classifiers for detecting anomalous Bitcoin transactions. The Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed to measure the contribution of each feature, and it is compatible with ensemble models. Moreover, we present rules for interpreting whether a Bitcoin transaction is anomalous or not. Additionally, we have introduced an under-sampling algorithm named XGBCLUS, designed to balance anomalous and non-anomalous transaction data. This algorithm is compared against other commonly used under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. Finally, the outcomes of various tree-based single classifiers are compared with those of stacking and voting ensemble classifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that: (i) XGBCLUS enhances TPR and ROC-AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art under-sampling and over-sampling techniques, and (ii) our proposed ensemble classifiers outperform traditional single tree-based machine learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, TPR, and FPR scores. |
|**2024-01-05**|**Towards a zk-SNARK compiler for Wolfram language**|Armando Cruz et.al.|[2401.02935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02935)| Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-Proofs) are communication protocols by which a prover can demonstrate to a verifier that it possesses a solution to a given public problem without revealing the content of the solution. Arbitrary computations can be transformed into an interactive zk-Proof so anyone is convinced that it was executed correctly without knowing what was executed on, having huge implications for digital currency. Despite this, interactive proofs are not suited for blockchain applications but novel protocols such as zk-SNARKs have made zero-knowledge ledgers like Zcash possible. This project builds upon Wolfram's ZeroKnowledgeProofs paclet and implements a zk-SNARK compiler based on Pinocchio protocol. |
|**2024-01-05**|**An Analysis of Avalanche Consensus**|Ignacio Amores-Sesar et.al.|[2401.02811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02811)| A family of leaderless, decentralized consensus protocols, called Snow consensus was introduced in a recent whitepaper by Yin et al. These protocols address limitations of existing consensus methods, such as those using proof-of-work or quorums, by utilizing randomization and maintaining some level of resilience against Byzantine participants. Crucially, Snow consensus underpins the Avalanche blockchain, which provides a popular cryptocurrency and a platform for running smart contracts.   Snow consensus algorithms are built on a natural, randomized routine, whereby participants continuously sample subsets of others and adopt an observed majority value until consensus is achieved. Additionally, Snow consensus defines conditions based on participants' local views and security parameters. These conditions indicate when a party can confidently finalize its local value, knowing it will be adopted by honest participants.   Although Snow consensus algorithms can be formulated concisely, there is a complex interaction between randomization, adversarial influence, and security parameters, which requires a formal analysis of their security and liveness. Snow protocols form the foundation for Avalanche-type blockchains, and this work aims to increase our understanding of such protocols by providing insights into their liveness and safety characteristics. First, we analyze these Snow protocols in terms of latency and security. Second, we expose a design issue where the trade-off between these two is unfavorable. Third, we propose a modification of the original protocol where this trade-off is much more favorable. |

These schemes represent a departure from traditional cryptographic paradigms, with HPPK leveraging the security of homomorphic symmetric encryption across two hidden rings without reliance on NP-hard problems. HPPK can be viewed as a specialized variant of Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC), intricately associated with two vector spaces: the polynomial vector space for the secret exchange and the multivariate vector space for randomized encapsulation.   The unique integration of asymmetric, symmetric, and homomorphic cryptography within HPPK necessitates a careful examination of its performance metrics. This study focuses on the thorough benchmarking of HPPK KEM and DS across key cryptographic operations, encompassing key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. The results highlight the exceptional efficiency of HPPK, characterized by compact key sizes, cipher sizes, and signature sizes. The use of symmetric encryption in HPPK enhances its overall performance. Key findings underscore the outstanding performance of HPPK KEM and DS across various security levels, emphasizing their superiority in crucial cryptographic operations. This research positions HPPK as a promising and competitive solution for post-quantum cryptographic applications in a wide range of applications, including blockchain, digital currency, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. |

Consensus protocols have been augmented with different notion of fair ordering in order to counter the problem. Out of all practical protocols, the most efficient BFT consensus requires $O(nTL + n^2T)$ communication complexity, where $n$ is number node, $T$ is number of transactions and $L$ is average transaction size. In this work, we propose a new system of BFT fair ordering protocols, Travelers, that substantially reduce the communication complexity. The proposed system of protocols satisfy a new notion of fair ordering, called probabilistic fair ordering, which is an extension to some existing notions of fairness. The new notion allows a small probability of error $\epsilon$, that adversary can insert some transactions at any location in a block, but for the remaining $1-\epsilon$ the a modified version of ordering linearizability holds. Our mechanism neither require a dissemination network nor direct submissions to all consensus nodes. The key innovation comes from a routing protocol, that is both flexible and efficient. We construct a protocol with $O(c\log({n})TL + n^2)$ communication complexity with $\epsilon = 1/n^c$ for some system parameter $c\ge 1$ . |

Despite their rapid adoption, limited research has been conducted to understand the underlying code structure of these applications. In particular, each dApp is composed of multiple smart contracts, each containing a number of functions that can be called to trigger a specific event, e.g., a token transfer. In this paper, we reconstruct and analyse the network of contracts and functions calls within the dApp, which is helpful to unveil vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attackers. We show how decentralization is architecturally implemented, identifying common development patterns and anomalies that could influence the system's robustness and efficiency. We find a consistent network structure characterized by modular, self-sufficient contracts and a complex web of function interactions, indicating common coding practices across the blockchain community. Critically, a small number of key functions within each dApp play a pivotal role in maintaining network connectivity, making them potential targets for cyber attacks and highlighting the need for robust security measures. |
|**2024-01-03**|**Architectural Design for Secure Smart Contract Development**|Myles Lewis et.al.|[2401.01891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01891)| As time progresses, the need for more secure applications grows exponentially. The different types of sensitive information that is being transferred virtually has sparked a rise in systems that leverage blockchain. Different sectors are beginning to use this disruptive technology to evaluate the risks and benefits. Sectors like finance, medicine, higher education, and wireless communication have research regarding blockchain. Futhermore, the need for security standards in this area of research is pivotal. In recent past, several attacks on blockchain infrastructures have resulted in hundreds of millions dollars lost and sensitive information compromised. Some of these attacks include DAO attacks, bZx attacks, and Parity Multisignature Wallet Double Attacks which targeted vulnerabilities within smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These attacks exposed the weaknesses of current smart contract development practices which has led to the increase in distrust and adoption of systems that leverage blockchain for its functionality. In this paper, I identify common software vulnerabilities and attacks on blockchain infrastructures, thoroughly detail the smart contract development process and propose a model for ensuring a stronger security standard for future systems leveraging smart contracts. The purpose for proposing a model is to promote trust among end users in the system which is a foundational element for blockchain adoption in the future. |

However, the increasing numbers of EVs pose significant challenges to the electrical grids. In addition, the number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to meet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure. Recently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from DERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs. Accommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution systems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and resilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the critical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems with grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency in DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution systems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and algorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market clearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain technology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other models from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the policies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and challenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs. A roadmap for future research and sharing strategies is provided to guide policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders toward a sustainable, resilient, and efficient energy market by integrating P2P technology into EVCIs and MGs. |

In contrast to financial markets, ruled by traditional corporations, DeFi is completely transparent as it keeps records of all transactions that occur in the network and makes them publicly available. The availability of the data represents an opportunity to analyze and understand the market from the complexity that emerges from the interactions of the actors (users, bots and companies) operating in the embedded market. In this paper we focus on the Ethereum network and our main goal is to show that the properties of the underlying transaction network provide further and useful information to forecast the evolution of the market. We aim to separate the non redundant effects of the blockchain transaction network properties from classic technical indicators and social media trends in the future price of Ethereum. To this end, we build two machine learning models to predict the future trend of the market. The first one serves as a base model and considers a set of the most relevant features according to the current scientific literature including technical indicators and social media trends. The second model considers the features of the base model, together with the network properties computed from the transaction networks. We found that the full model outperforms the base model and can anticipate 46 more rises in the price than the base model and 19 more falls. |
|**2024-10-14**|**The Boomerang protocol: A Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Incentive Protocol**|Ralph Ankele et.al.|[2401.01353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01353)| In the era of data-driven economies, incentive systems and loyalty programs, have become ubiquitous in various sectors, including advertising, retail, travel, and financial services. While these systems offer advantages for both users and companies, they necessitate the transfer and analysis of substantial amounts of sensitive data. Privacy concerns have become increasingly pertinent, necessitating the development of privacy-preserving incentive protocols. Despite the rising demand for secure and decentralised systems, the existing landscape lacks a comprehensive solution.   In this work, we propose the BOOMERANG protocol, a novel decentralised privacy-preserving incentive protocol that leverages cryptographic black box accumulators to securely and privately store user interactions within the incentive system. Moreover, the protocol employs zero-knowledge proofs to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy. To further enhance public verifiability and transparency, we utilise a smart contract on a Layer 1 blockchain to verify these zero-knowledge proofs. The careful combination of black box accumulators and zero-knowledge proofs makes the BOOMERANG protocol highly efficient. |
|**2024-01-08**|**PPBFL: A Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model**|Yang Li et.al.|[2401.01204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01204)| With the rapid development of machine learning and a growing concern for data privacy, federated learning has become a focal point of attention. However, attacks on model parameters and a lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning. Therefore, we propose A Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and encourage active participation of nodes in model training. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing protection against tampering. Within the blockchain, we introduce a Proof of Training Work (PoTW) consensus algorithm tailored for federated learning, aiming to incentive training nodes. This algorithm rewards nodes with greater computational power, promoting increased participation and effort in the federated learning process. A novel adaptive differential privacy algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models. This safeguards the privacy of local data at training clients, preventing malicious nodes from launching inference attacks. Additionally, it enhances the security of the global model, preventing potential security degradation resulting from the combination of numerous local models. The possibility of security degradation is derived from the composition theorem. By introducing reverse noise in the global model, a zero-bias estimate of differential privacy noise between local and global models is achieved. Furthermore, we propose a new mix transactions mechanism utilizing ring signature technology to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL, compared to baseline methods, not only exhibits superior model performance but also achieves higher security. |
|**2024-01-01**|**Automated Invariant Generation for Solidity Smart Contracts**|Ye Liu et.al.|[2401.00650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00650)| Smart contracts are computer programs running on blockchains to automate the transaction execution between users. The absence of contract specifications poses a real challenge to the correctness verification of smart contracts. Program invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the execution, which characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, INVCON+, for Solidity smart contracts. INVCON+ extends the existing invariant detector, InvCon, to automatically produce verified contract invariants based on both dynamic inference and static verification. Unlike INVCON+, InvCon only produces likely invariants, which have a high probability to hold, yet are still not verified against the contract code. Particularly, INVCON+ is able to infer more expressive invariants that capture richer semantic relations of contract code. We evaluate INVCON+ on 361 ERC20 and 10 ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as common ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that INVCON+ efficiently produces high-quality invariant specifications, which can be used to secure smart contracts from common vulnerabilities. |

Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its nodes into parallel shards, yet it's vulnerable to the $1\%$ attacks where dishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing security with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional optimization. This paper introduces a Trust-based and DRL-driven (\textsc{TbDd}) framework, crafted to counter shard collusion risks and dynamically adjust node allocation, enhancing throughput while maintaining network security. With a comprehensive trust evaluation mechanism, \textsc{TbDd} discerns node types and performs targeted resharding against potential threats. The model maximizes tolerance for dishonest nodes, optimizes node movement frequency, ensures even node distribution in shards, and balances sharding risks. Rigorous evaluations prove \textsc{TbDd}'s superiority over conventional random-, community-, and trust-based sharding methods in shard risk equilibrium and reducing cross-shard transactions. |

However, given the high sensitivity of the industry to the security of industrial control system networks and IIoT, the use of software-defined networking (SDN) technology can provide improved security and automation of communication processes. Despite this, the architecture of SDN can give rise to various security threats. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider the impact of these threats on SDN-based IIoT environments. Unlike previous research, which focused on security in IIoT and SDN architectures separately, we propose an integrated method including two components that work together seamlessly for better detecting and preventing security threats associated with SDN-based IIoT architectures. The two components consist in a convolutional neural network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented as an SDN application and a Blockchain-based system (BS) to empower application layer and network layer security, respectively. A significant advantage of the proposed method lies in jointly minimizing the impact of attacks such as command injection and rule injection on SDN-based IIoT architecture layers. The proposed IDS exhibits superior classification accuracy in both binary and multiclass categories. |

Without a third-party interface or what is known as a Blockchain Oracle, it can not interact with the external world. This Oracle plays a crucial role by feeding extrinsic data into the Blockchain, ensuring that Smart Contracts operate accurately in real time. The Oracle problem arises from the inherent difficulty in verifying the truthfulness of the data sourced by these Oracles. The genuineness of a Blockchain Oracle is paramount, as it directly influences the Blockchain's reliability, credibility, and scalability. To tackle these challenges, a strategy rooted in Byzantine fault tolerance {\phi} is introduced. Furthermore, an autonomous system for sustainability and audibility, built on heuristic detection, is put forth. The effectiveness and precision of the proposed strategy outperformed existing methods using two real-world datasets, aimed to meet the authenticity standards for Blockchain Oracles. |

Web 3.0 is driven by secure keys, typically represented in hexadecimal, that are pseudo-randomly generated by an initialization vector and complex computational algorithms. We demonstrate that the statistical physical Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) scheme eliminates the additional computational power by naturally generating truly random binary keys to drive the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that are appended to an Ethereum blockchain. |
|**2023-12-28**|**Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Public Key Searchable Encryption with Strong Traceability**|Yue Han et.al.|[2312.16954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16954)| Public key searchable encryption (PKSE) scheme allows data users to search over encrypted data. To identify illegal users, many traceable PKSE schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot trace the keywords which illegal users searched and protect users' privacy simultaneously. In some practical applications, tracing both illegal users' identities and the keywords which they searched is quite important to against the abuse of data. It is a challenge to bind users' identities and keywords while protecting their privacy. Moreover, existing traceable PKSE schemes do not consider the unforgeability and immutability of trapdoor query records, which can lead to the occurrence of frame-up and denying. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving PKSE with strong traceability (BP3KSEST) scheme. Our scheme provides the following features: (1) authorized users can authenticate to trapdoor generation center and obtain trapdoors without releasing their identities and keywords; (2) when data users misbehave in the system, the trusted third party (TTP) can trace both their identities and the keywords which they searched; (3) trapdoor query records are unforgeable; (4) trapdoor query records are immutable because records are stored in blockchain. Notably, this scheme is suitable to the scenarios where privacy must be considered, e.g., electronic health record (EHR). We formalize both the definition and security model of our BP3KSEST scheme, and present a concrete construction. Furthermore, the security of the proposed scheme is formally proven. Finally, the implementation and evaluation are conducted to analyze its efficiency. |

ANKA utilizes state-of-the-art technologies, namely blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Within this marketplace, users who possess surplus energy actively offer their excess energy for trading. Concurrently, consumers can readily explore the energy options available and make purchases according to their individual preferences while taking into consideration the location of the offered energy and voltage compatibility. In addition, we provide a comparison between a centralized traditional market and our proposed solution, identifying that the cost of deploying and operating ANKA is less than the centralized approach. We also position ANKA in comparison to the recent blockchain-based decentralized energy marketplaces by considering the metrics of blockchain type, scope, trading entities and the presence of third parties. |

In this paper we introduce an innovative methodology designed to detect wash trading activities beyond surface-level transactions. Our approach integrates NFT ownership traces with the Ethereum Transaction Network, encompassing the complete historical record of all Ethereum account normal transactions. By analyzing both networks, our method offers a notable advancement over techniques proposed by existing research. We analyzed the wash trading activity of 7 notable NFT collections. Our results show that wash trading in unregulated NFT markets is an underestimated concern and is much more widespread both in terms of frequency as well as volume. Excluding the Meebits collection, which emerged as an outlier, we found that wash trading constituted up to 25% of the total trading volume. Specifically, for the Meebits collection, a staggering 93% of its total trade volume was attributed to wash trading. |
|**2023-12-27**|**Vulnerability Scanners for Ethereum Smart Contracts: A Large-Scale Study**|Christoph Sendner et.al.|[2312.16533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16533)| Ethereum smart contracts, which are autonomous decentralized applications on the blockchain that manage assets often exceeding millions of dollars, have become primary targets for cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, such vulnerabilities led to substantial financial losses exceeding a billion of US dollars. To counter these threats, various tools have been developed by academic and commercial entities to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our study investigates the gap between the effectiveness of existing security scanners and the vulnerabilities that still persist in practice. We compiled four distinct datasets for this analysis. The first dataset comprises 77,219 source codes extracted directly from the blockchain, while the second includes over 4 million bytecodes obtained from Ethereum Mainnet and testnets. The other two datasets consist of nearly 14,000 manually annotated smart contracts and 373 smart contracts verified through audits, providing a foundation for a rigorous ground truth analysis on bytecode and source code. Using the unlabeled datasets, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 17 vulnerability scanners, revealing considerable discrepancies in their findings. Our analysis of the ground truth datasets indicated poor performance across all the tools we tested. This study unveils the reasons for poor performance and underscores that the current state of the art for smart contract security falls short in effectively addressing open problems, highlighting that the challenge of effectively detecting vulnerabilities remains a significant and unresolved issue. |

This work aims to empirically study LN's fee revenue for network participants. Under realistic assumptions on payment amounts, routing algorithms and traffic distribution, we analyze the economic returns of the network's largest routing nodes which currently hold the network together, and assess whether the centralizing tendency is incentive-compatible from an economic viewpoint. Moreover, since recent literature has proved that participation is economically irrational for the majority of large nodes, we evaluate the long-term impact on the network topology when participants start behaving rationally. |
|**2024-03-25**|**Blockchain-Envisioned Post-Quantum Secure Sanitizable Signature for Audit Logs Management**|Vikas Srivastava et.al.|[2312.16322](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16322)| Audit logs are one of the most important tools for transparently tracking system events and maintaining continuous oversight in corporate organizations and enterprise business systems. There are many cases where the audit logs contain sensitive data, or the audit logs are enormous. In these situations, dealing with a subset of the data is more practical than the entire data set. To provide a secure solution to handle these issues, a sanitizable signature scheme (SSS) is a viable cryptographic primitive. Herein, we first present the first post-quantum secure multivariate-based SSS, namely Mul-SAN. Our proposed design provides unforgeability, privacy, immutability, signer accountability, and sanitizer accountability under the assumption that the MQ problem is NP-hard. Mul-SAN is very efficient and only requires computing field multiplications and additions over a finite field for its implementation. Mul-SAN presents itself as a practical method to partially delegate control of the authenticated data in avenues like the healthcare industry and government organizations. We also explore using Blockchain to provide a tamper-proof and robust audit log mechanism. |

The permissioned layer-2, by relying on the public consensus of the underlying network, assures the security and integrity of the transactions and ensures interoperability with domestic CBDCs implementations. Multiple Layer-3s operate various Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and compete with each other for the lowest costs. To provide insights into the practical implications of the system, simulations of trading costs are conducted based on historical FX rates, with Project Mariana as a benchmark. The study shows that, even with liquidity fragmentation, a multi-layer and multi-AMM setup is more cost-efficient than a single AMM. |

Blockchains are known for their distinctive features, such as decentralized architecture, tamper-proof data structures, and traceable transactions. These features make Blockchain a preferred choice of platform for developing applications in financial service areas. Meanwhile, some questions have been raised regarding Blockchain's suitability to compete with or even replace existing financial systems. This paper provides insights into the current progress of Blockchain applications in insurance, banking, payments, asset trading, loans, remittances, the Internet of Things (IoT) for the finance industry, financial inclusions, and enterprise-level interaction in finance and governance. We review the barriers to widespread Blockchain adoption, especially the risks when transaction fees dominate mining rewards. By comparing the emerging Blockchain technologies and incentive issues related to real-world applications, we hope that this paper can serve as a valuable source of reference for Blockchain researchers and developers in financial service areas. |
|**2023-12-24**|**Blockchain Smart Contract Threat Detection Technology Based on Symbolic Execution**|Chang Chu et.al.|[2312.15392](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15392)| The security of smart contracts, which are an important part of blockchain technology, has attracted much attention. In particular, reentrancy vulnerability, which is hidden and complex, poses a great threat to smart contracts. In order to improve the existing detection methods, which exhibit low efficiency and accuracy, in this paper, we propose a smart contract threat detection technology based on symbolic execution. In this method, first, the recursive descent algorithm is used to recover the basic blocks of contract code and control flow diagram, and static type inference is performed for static single assignment (SSA) variables. Then, the control flow diagram is encoded into constrained horn clause (CHC) constraints in combination with the symbolic execution technology. Model checking is conducted for the generated constraints using an automatic theorem prover based on the abstraction refinement technique for fast static detection of common security threats in smart contracts. Compared with existing detection methods, the method proposed in this paper allows the detection of both the checks-effects-interactions pattern and the vulnerability in relation to reentrant locks. It can simulate the state changes of reentrant locks as well as other global variables in multiple recursive transactions. The experimental results show that this method significantly increases both detection efficiency and accuracy, improving the security of smart contracts. |

It is designed to reduce theft and losses on the blockchain by allowing a victim to recover their stolen or lost assets during the recovery window. When an honest recipient receives an ERC-20R asset, they must wait until the recovery windows elapses (say, 24 hours), before they can unwrap the asset back to its base ERC-20 form. We argue that many DeFi services will likely refuse to accept unsettled recoverable assets because they can interfere with their normal operations. Consequently, when Alice receives an ERC-20R token, she must wait 24 hours before she can use it with a DeFi service. But what if Alice is willing to pay a fee to exchange the wrapped token for an unwrapped ERC-20 token that can be used right away? In this paper we explore how to design a pool to exchange an unsettled ERC-20R asset for a base ERC-20 of the same asset. Designing such a pool raises several challenging questions and we present our solutions. |

The phenomenon of sextortion is now widely studied by psychologists, sociologists, criminologists, etc. The findings have been translated into scattered help from NGOs, specialized law enforcement units, and therapists, who usually do not coordinate their efforts among each other. This paper addresses the gap of lacking coordination systems to effectively and efficiently use modern information technologies that align the efforts of scattered and non-aligned sextortion help organizations. Consequently, this paper not only investigates the goals, incentives, and disincentives for a system design and development that not only governs effectively and efficiently diverse cases of sextortion victims, but also leverages artificial intelligence in a targeted manner. It explores how AI and, in particular, autonomous cognitive entities can improve victim profiles analysis, streamline support mechanisms, and provide intelligent insight into sextortion cases. Furthermore, the paper conceptually studies the extent to which such efforts can be monetized in a sustainable way. Following a novel design methodology for the design of trusted blockchain decentralized applications, the paper presents a set of conceptual requirements and system models based on which it is possible to deduce a best-practice technology stack for rapid implementation deployment. |
|**2023-12-21**|**Dynamic Mining Interval to Improve Blockchain Throughput**|Hou-Wan Long et.al.|[2312.14038](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14038)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi), propelled by Blockchain technology, has revolutionized traditional financial systems, improving transparency, reducing costs, and fostering financial inclusion. However, transaction activities in these systems fluctuate significantly and the throughput can be effected. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Mining Interval (DMI) mechanism that adjusts mining intervals in response to block size and trading volume to enhance the transaction throughput of Blockchain platforms. Besides, in the context of public Blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, a shift towards transaction fees dominance over coin-based rewards is projected in near future. As a result, the ecosystem continues to face threats from deviant mining activities such as Undercutting Attacks, Selfish Mining, and Pool Hopping, among others. In recent years, Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies were proposed to allocate transactions dynamically based on fees thereby stabilizing block incentives. However, DTS' utilization of Merkle tree leaf nodes can reduce system throughput. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach for combining DMI and DTS. Besides, we also discuss the DMI selection mechanism for adjusting mining intervals based on various factors. |
|**2024-05-20**|**How Does Stake Distribution Influence Consensus? Analyzing Blockchain Decentralization**|Shashank Motepalli et.al.|[2312.13938](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13938)| In the PoS blockchain landscape, the challenge of achieving full decentralization is often hindered by a disproportionate concentration of staked tokens among a few validators. This study analyses this challenge by first formalizing decentralization metrics for weighted consensus mechanisms. An empirical analysis across ten permissionless blockchains uncovers significant weight concentration among validators, underscoring the need for an equitable approach. To counter this, we introduce the Square Root Stake Weight (SRSW) model, which effectively recalibrates staking weight distribution. Our examination of the SRSW model demonstrates notable improvements in the decentralization metrics: the Gini index improves by 37.16% on average, while Nakamoto coefficients for liveness and safety see mean enhancements of 101.04% and 80.09%, respectively. This research is a pivotal step toward a more fair and equitable distribution of staking weight, advancing the decentralization in blockchain consensus mechanisms. |

A Delphi Study**|Giulio Caldarelli et.al.|[2312.13774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13774)| Given the rising interest in the circular economy and blockchain hype, numerous integrations were proposed. However, studies on the practical feasibility were scarce, and the assumptions of blockchain potential in the circular economy were rarely questioned. With the help of eleven of the most prominent blockchain experts, the present study critically analyzed technology integration in many areas of the circular economy to forecast their possible outcomes. Delphi's technique is leveraged to reach a consensus among experts' visions and opinions. Results support the view that some circular economy integrations are unlikely to succeed, while others if specific conditions are met, may prove to be successful in the long run. |
|**2024-06-10**|**Automated Market Maker on the XRP Ledger**|Firas Dahi et.al.|[2312.13749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13749)| Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a transformative force in the financial sector, with Automated Market Makers (AMMs) playing a crucial role in facilitating asset exchange and liquidity provision. However, most AMMs operate on the Ethereum blockchain and face challenges such as high transaction fees and price synchronization issues mainly due to Ethereum scalability issues.   This paper addresses these limitations by investigating the performance of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) integrated at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. Using game-theoretic simulations, we compared the XRPL-AMM to a Generic CPMM-based AMM (G-AMM) on Ethereum, akin to established players like Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation. The results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM outperforms in terms of price synchronization with external markets, lower slippage, reduced impermanent loss, and improved returns for liquidity providers, particularly under volatile market conditions. The unique Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) of the XRPL-AMM further enhances its efficiency by incentivizing beneficial arbitrage. These findings highlight the potential of protocol-level AMM integration.   To the best of our knowledge, the XRPL-AMM is one of the first AMMs built directly at the protocol level of a blockchain. Therefore, this inaugural study ventures into the unexplored domain of evaluating AMMs with protocol-level integration compared to traditional smart contracts implementations. |

However, some vulnerabilities persist, notably front-running by malicious actors who exploit transaction information to gain financial advantage. Consensus with a fair order aims at preventing such attacks, and in particular, the differential order fairness property addresses this problem and connects fair ordering to the validity of consensus. The notion is implemented by the Quick Order-Fair Atomic Broadcast (QOF) protocol (Cachin et al., FC '22). This paper revisits the QOF protocol and describes a modular implementation that uses a generic consensus component. Moreover, an empirical evaluation is performed to compare the performance of QOF to a consensus protocol without fairness. Measurements show that the increased complexity comes at a cost, throughput decreases by at most 5%, and latency increases by roughly 50ms, using an emulated ideal network. This paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of practical aspects regarding differential order fairness with the QOF protocol and also connects this with similar fairness-imposing protocols like Themis and Pompe. |

Utilizing Rothwell and Zegveld's taxonomy of twelve innovation policy tools, this study offers a nuanced comparison of domestic blockchain policies, dissecting supply, environment, and demand-driven policy dimensions to distill prevailing strategic orientations towards blockchain healthcare adoption. The findings indicate that blockchain technology has seen rapid growth in the healthcare industry. However, a certain misalignment exists between the corporate and policy layers in terms of supply and demand. While companies focus more on technological applications, existing policies are geared towards regulations and governance. Government emphasis lies on legal supervision through environmental policies, aiming to guide the standardization and regulation of blockchain technology. This maintains a balance between encouraging innovation and market and legal regulatory order, thereby providing a reference for the development of the distributed intelligent healthcare industry in our country. |
|**2023-12-19**|**FairFlow Protocol: Equitable Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) mitigation in Ethereum**|Dipankar Sarkar et.al.|[2312.12654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12654)| Ethereum has emerged as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) due to its robust smart contract capabilities. One of the critical issues in the Ethereum ecosystem is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a concept that has gained significant attention in the blockchain community. However, MEV has remained a major challenge with significant implications for the platform's operation and integrity. This paper introduces the FairFlow protocol, a novel framework designed to mitigate the effects of MEV within Ethereum's existing infrastructure. The protocol aims to provide a more equitable environment, preventing exploitation by miners or validators, and protecting user data. The combined approach of auction-based block space allocation and randomized transaction ordering significantly reduces the potential for MEV exploitation. |

Although bridges are becoming increasingly popular, they are still in their infancy and have been attacked multiple times recently, causing significant financial loss. Although there are numerous reports online explaining each of the incidents on cross-chain bridges, they are scattered over the Internet, and there is no work that analyzes the security landscape of cross-chain bridges in a holistic manner. To fill the gap, in this paper, we performed a systematic study of cross-chain bridge security issues. First, we summarize the characteristics of existing cross-chain bridges, including their usages, verification mechanisms, communication models, and three categorizations. Based on these characteristics, we identify 12 potential attack vectors that attackers may exploit. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that categorizes cross-chain attacks in the past two years into 10 distinct types, and then provide explanations for each vulnerability type, accompanied by Solidity code examples. We also discuss existing and potential defenses, as well as open questions and future research directions on cross-chain bridges. We believe that this systematization can shed light on designing and implementing cross-chain bridges with higher security and, more importantly, facilitating future research on building a better cross-chain bridge ecosystem. |

Flanery et.al.|[2312.12268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12268)| With the natural evolution of the web, the need for decentralization has rendered the current centralized education system out of date. The student does not "own" their credentials, as the only way their accomplishments are directly linked to their person and considered valuable is by verification through a stamp of an expensive, prestigious institution. However, going to a university is no longer the only way to acquire an education; open-source learning material is widely available and accessible through the internet. However, our society does not deem these methods of education as verifiable if they do not include a degree or certificate. Additionally, a valid certificate for the vast majority of open-source courses costs a few hundred dollars to obtain. The centralized nature of education inadvertently places students in underprivileged communities at a disadvantage in comparison to students in economically advantaged communities, thus a decentralized approach to education would eliminate the vast majority of such discrepancies. In the present paper, we integrate Decentralized Identity (DID) with Web 3.0 to upload credentials linked directly to the user. Each credential is appended to an Ethereum blockchain that, by design, cannot be altered once uploaded. We include DID document based access controls to display the candidate's upload and verification history. Finally, we utilize TLS protocols to provide a secure connection to the internet for ensuring non-fungibility of credentials and authentication of users. |
|**2024-09-16**|**Elliptic Curve Pairing Stealth Address Protocols**|Marija Mikic et.al.|[2312.12131](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12131)| Protecting the privacy of blockchain transactions is extremely important for users. Stealth address protocols (SAP) allow users to receive assets via stealth addresses that they do not associate with their stealth meta-addresses. SAP can be generated using different cryptographic approaches. DKSAP uses an elliptic curve multiplication and hashing of the resulting shared secret. Another approach is to use a elliptic curve pairing. This paper presents four SA protocols that use elliptic curve pairing as a cryptographic solution. ECPDKSAPs are pairing-based protocols that include viewing key and spending key, while ECPSKSAP is a pairing-based protocol that uses a single key with which spending and the viewing key are derived. We find that ECPDKSAPs give significantly better results than DKSAP with the view tag. The best results are achieved with Protocol 3 (Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual Key Stealth Address Protocol), which is Ethereum-friendly. ECPSKSAP is significantly slower, but it provides an interesting theoretical result as it uses only one private key. |

Nevertheless, this technique introduces various privacy concerns, including pseudonymity, Sybil attacks, and potential susceptibilities to quantum computing, to name a few. In response to these challenges, innovative privacy-enhancing solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and stealth addresses (SA) have been developed. Among the various schemes, SA stands out as it prevents the association of a blockchain transaction's output with the recipient's public address, thereby ensuring transactional anonymity. However, the basic SA schemes have exhibited vulnerabilities to key leakage and quantum computing attacks. To address these shortcomings, we present a pioneering solution - Homomorphic Encryption-based Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (HE-DKSAP), which can be further extended to Fully HE-DKSAP (FHE-DKSAP). By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, HE-DKSAP introduces a novel approach to safeguarding transaction privacy and preventing potential quantum computing attacks. This paper delves into the core principles of HE-DKSAP, highlighting its capacity to enhance privacy, scalability, and security in programmable blockchains. Through a comprehensive exploration of its design architecture, security analysis, and practical implementations, this work establishes a privacy-preserving, practical, and efficient stealth address protocol via additively homomorphic encryption. |

However, current DTNs networking frameworks pose a number of challenges especially when applied in scenarios that require high communication efficiency and multimodal data processing. First, current DTNs frameworks are unavoidable regarding high resource consumption and communication congestion because of original bit-level communication and high-frequency computation, especially distributed learning-based DTNs. Second, current machine learning models for DTNs are domain-specific (e.g. E-health), making it difficult to handle DT scenarios with multimodal data processing requirements. Last but not least, current security schemes for DTNs, such as blockchain, introduce additional overheads that impair the efficiency of DTNs. To address the above challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM) empowered DTNs networking framework, LLM-Twin. First, we design the mini-giant model collaboration scheme to achieve efficient deployment of LLM in DTNs, since LLM are naturally conducive to processing multimodal data. Then, we design a semantic-level high-efficiency, and secure communication model for DTNs. The feasibility of LLM-Twin is demonstrated by numerical experiments and case studies. To our knowledge, this is the first to propose LLM-based semantic-level digital twin networking framework. |

Despite stringent regulations like HIPAA, significant gaps in policy compliance often remain undetected until a data breach occurs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel blockchain-powered, smart contract-based access control model. This model is specifically designed to enforce patient-provider agreements (PPAs) and other relevant policies, thereby ensuring both policy compliance and provenance. Our approach integrates components of informed consent into PPAs, employing blockchain smart contracts to automate and secure policy enforcement. The authorization module utilizes these contracts to make informed access decisions, recording all actions in a transparent, immutable blockchain ledger. This system not only ensures that policies are rigorously applied but also maintains a verifiable record of all actions taken, thus facilitating an easy audit and proving compliance. We implement this model in a private Ethereum blockchain setup, focusing on maintaining the integrity and lineage of policies and ensuring that audit trails are accurately and securely recorded. The Proof of Compliance (PoC) consensus mechanism enables decentralized, independent auditor nodes to verify compliance status based on the audit trails recorded. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in a simulated healthcare environment. The results show that our approach not only strengthens policy compliance and provenance but also enhances the transparency and accountability of the entire process. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive, blockchain-based solution to a longstanding problem in healthcare data management, offering a robust framework for ensuring policy compliance and provenance through smart contracts and blockchain technology. |

Its true potential is not practically utilized yet. In a very short period of time, it has evolved twice - Smart contracts and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAG based blockchains currently referred to as Blockchain 3.0 solves many issues in the current conventional blockchain technologies including transaction fees, transaction approval times and scalability. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of blockchain implementations based on DAG including IOTA, NxT, Byteball, Nano, DAGCoin, Fantom, XDAG and Caixapay. We discuss limitations of both conventional and DAG based blockchains and suggest when to prefer DAG based blockchains. |

Starting with the Proof-of-Work, there have been various versions of consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Each of these algorithms focuses on different aspects to ensure efficient and reliable processing of transactions. Blockchain operates in a decentralized manner where there is no central authority and the network is composed of diverse users. This openness creates the potential for malicious nodes to disrupt the network in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to embed a mechanism within the blockchain network to constantly monitor, identify, and eliminate these malicious nodes. However, there is no one-size-fits-all mechanism to identify all malicious nodes. Hence, the dynamic adaptability of the blockchain network is important to maintain security and reliability at all times. This paper introduces MRL-PoS, a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. MRL-PoS employs reinforcement learning for dynamically adjusting to the behavior of all users. It incorporates a system of rewards and penalties to eliminate malicious nodes and incentivize honest ones. Additionally, MRL-PoS has the capability to learn and respond to new malicious tactics by continually training its agents. |

Utilizing an immutable endpoint, append-only verification modules, and fully-configurable verification infrastructure, LayerZero provides the security, configurability, and extensibility necessary to achieve omnichain interoperability. LayerZero enforces strict application-exclusive ownership of protocol security and cost through its novel trust-minimized modular security framework which is designed to universally support all blockchains and use cases. Omnichain applications (OApps) built on the LayerZero protocol achieve frictionless blockchain-agnostic interoperation through LayerZero's universal network semantics. |

Software patterns have been proposed to summarize upgradeable smart contract best practices. However, research is missing on the comparison of these upgradeable smart contract patterns, especially regarding gas costs related to deployment and execution. This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of gas costs associated with two prevalent upgradeable smart contract patterns: the Proxy and diamond patterns. The Proxy pattern utilizes a Proxy pointing to a logic contract, while the diamond pattern enables a Proxy to point to multiple logic contracts. We conduct a comparative analysis of gas costs for both patterns in contrast to a traditional non-upgradeable smart contract. We derive from this analysis a theoretical contribution in the form of two consolidated blockchain patterns and a corresponding decision model. By so doing we hope to contribute to the broader understanding of upgradeable smart contract patterns. |

Blockchain consensus mechanisms (CMs) are key to enabling nodes in a wireless network to achieve consistency without any trusted entity. However, consensus reliability will be seriously affected by the instability of communication links in wireless networks. Meanwhile, it is difficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. Energy-intensive blockchain functions can quickly drain the power of nodes, thus degrading consensus performance. Fortunately, a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can solve the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages over the radio frequency (RF) signal emitted from a primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption, and the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. Such an approach is useful for almost all vote-based CMs, such as the Practical Byzantine Fault-tolerant (PBFT)-like and the RAFT-like CMs. This paper proposes symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC) by transforming 6 PBFT-like and 4 RAFT-like state-of-the-art (SOTA) CMs to demonstrate universality. These new CMs will benefit from mutualistic transmission relationships in SR, making full use of the limited spectrum resources in WBN. Simulation results show that SBC can increase the consensus success rate of PBFT-like and RAFT-like by 54.1% and 5.8%, respectively, and reduce energy consumption by 9.2% and 23.7%, respectively. |

Currently, cloud providers lack simple, efficient, and secure implementation of provisioning solutions that meet these challenges. Multi-cloud federation is a promising approach. In this paper, we evaluate the application of private and public blockchain networks for multi-cloud federation. We compare the performance of blockchain-based federation in private and public blockchain networks and their integration with a production-ready orchestration solution. Our results show that the public blockchain needs approximately 91 seconds to complete the federation procedure compared to the 48 seconds in the private blockchain scenario. |

Despite being a secured network, blockchains have some tradeoffs such as high latency, low throughput, and transaction failures. One of the core problems behind these is improper management of "conflicting transactions", which is also known as "contention". When there is a large pool of pending transactions in a blockchain and some of them are conflicting, a situation of contention occurs, and as a result, the latency of the network increases, and a substantial amount of resources are wasted which results in low throughput and transaction failures. In this paper, we proposed ConChain, a novel blockchain scheme that combines transaction parallelism and an intelligent dependency manager to minimize conflicting transactions in blockchain networks as well as improve performance. ConChain is also capable of ensuring proper defense against major attacks due to contention. |

In our framework, {we design a low-latency reputation-based proof-of-stake (RPoS) consensus protocol to select highly reliable blockchain-enabled BSs to securely store MEC user requests and prevent data tampering attacks.} {We formulate the MEC resource allocation optimization as a constrained Markov decision process that balances minimum processing latency and denial-of-service (DoS) probability}. {We use the MEC aggregated features as the DRL input to significantly reduce the high-dimensionality input of the remaining service processing time for individual MEC requests. Our designed constrained DRL effectively attains the optimal resource allocations that are adapted to the dynamic DoS requirements. We provide extensive simulation results and analysis to} validate that our BC-DRL framework achieves higher security, reliability, and resource utilization efficiency than benchmark blockchain consensus protocols and {MEC} resource allocation algorithms. |

This paper introduces a streamlined analytical framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), in this instance open-access generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, offering an efficient solution with deeper insights into community dynamics. The framework aids moderators in identifying pseudonymous actor intent, moderating toxic behavior, rewarding desired actions to avoid unintended consequences of blockchain-based gaming, and gauging community sentiment as communities venture into metaverse platforms and plan for hypergrowth. This framework strengthens community controls, eases onboarding, and promotes a common moral mission across communities while reducing agency costs by 95 pct. Highlighting the transformative role of generative AI, the paper emphasizes its potential to redefine the cost of cultural production. It showcases the utility of GPTs in digital community management, expanding their implications in cultural economics and transmedia storytelling. |

Typically, approaches in this field fall into two categories: either executing the entire process model on the blockchain or using the blockchain primarily to enforce or monitor the exchange of messages between participants. Our work proposes a novel approach that sits between these two methods.   We introduce a centralized process model extended with blockchain annotations, detailing the tasks of each participating organization and the extent to which blockchain technology is needed to secure task execution. This model also includes all critical data objects and specifies how their handling should be protected by the blockchain.   This technical report outlines a systematic three-step method for automatically decentralizing this comprehensive model into individual local process models for each organization, coupled with a separate process model for the blockchain. This decentralized structure effectively replicates the original global process model.   Our transformation approach is rule-based, focusing on creating a platform-inde-pendent model first, then a platform-specific model. Subsequently, we project the platform-specific model to obtain one model for the blockchain and one model for each participating organization. |

For example, one of their most critical applications is to provide seamless wireless communication services in remote rural areas. Thus, it is substantial to identify and consider the different security challenges in the research and development associated with advanced UAV-based B5G/6G architectures. Following this requirement, the present study thoroughly examines the security considerations about UAVs in relation to the architectural framework of the 5G/6G system, the technologies that facilitate its operation, and the concerns surrounding privacy. It exhibits security integration at all the protocol stack layers and analyzes the existing mechanisms to secure UAV-based B5G/6G communications and its energy and power optimization factors. Last, this article also summarizes modern technological trends for establishing security and protecting UAV-based systems, along with the open challenges and strategies for future research work. |

Decentralized pub/sub aims to provide this functionality without relying on centralized control or global network state information, enabling message propagation among nodes in a coordinated manner. Efficiency in pub/sub services entails ensuring that subscribers receive published messages promptly. We introduce Topiary, a rapid and scalable protocol designed for decentralized applications' pub/sub systems. Topiary autonomously learns an efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) topology tailored to the publish/subscribe network. It does so by analyzing peers' interactions with their neighbors. Inspired by concepts from the multi-armed bandit problem, Topiary strikes an optimal balance between maintaining connections with well-connected neighbors and exploring new connections within the network, based on their topical needs. Through experimental evaluations, Topiary has shown a 50% reduction in broadcast latency while achieving an interested topic coverage of over 98%, marking it as a promising solution for efficient decentralized pub/sub networks. |

In our view, such centralization is an overlooked risk of smart contracts that underlies well-known smart contract security incidents. Critically, mitigating the known vulnerability of missing permission verification by implementing authorization patterns can in turn introduce centralization. To delineate the issue, we define centralization risk and describe smart contract source code patterns for Ethereum and Algorand that can introduce it to smart contracts. We explain under which circumstances the centralization can be exploited. Finally, we discuss implications of centralization risk for different smart contract stakeholders. |

Those include optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, information oracles, and app-specific chains. This work presents an analysis of layer 2 blockchain strategies determining the optimal times for publishing transactions on the root chain. There is a trade-off between waiting for a better layer 1 gas price and the urgency to finalize layer 2 transactions. We present a model for the problem that captures this trade-off, generalizing previous works, and we analyze the properties of optimal publishing strategies. We show that such optimal strategies hold a computable simple form for a large class of cost functions. |

We perceive Federated Learning as a hierarchical structure, a federation of nodes with validators as the head. The process of validation is done through consensus by employing Novelty Detection and Snowball protocol, to identify valuable and relevant updates while filtering out potentially malicious or irrelevant updates, thus preventing Model Poisoning attacks. The opinion of the validators is recorded in blockchain and trust score is calculated. In case of lack of consensus, trust score is used to determine the impact of validators on the global model. A hyperparameter is introduced to guide the model generation process, either to rely on consensus or on trust score. This approach ensures transparency and reliability in the aggregation process and allows the global model to benefit from insights of most trusted nodes. In the training phase, the combination of IPFS , PGP encryption provides : a) secure and decentralized storage b) mitigates single point of failure making this system reliable and c) resilient against man in the middle attack. The system is realized by implementing in python and Foundry for smart contract development. Global Model is tested against data poisoning by flipping the labels and by introducing malicious nodes. Results found to be similar to that of Flower. |

The future policy of the company is to enlarge the offer of its services to nearby communities that are unable to set up and maintain their own network and software structures. This paper presents thus a possible architecture model to support small municipalities in supplying public services to citizens, with the aid of SED Spa.

In this paper, we introduce a novel notion, the Internet of Responsibilities, for accountability management. Our method sorts through the list of responsibilities with respect to hazardous positions. The positions are interconnected using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) indicating the hierarchy of responsibilities in the organization. In addition, the system detects and collects responsibilities, and represents risk areas in terms of the positions of the responsibility nodes. Finally, an automatic reminder and assignment system is used to enforce a strict responsibility control without human intervention. Using blockchain technology, we further extend our system with the capability to store, recover and encrypt responsibility data. We show that through the application of the Internet of Responsibility network model driven by Big Data, enterprise and government agencies can attain a highly secured and safe workplace. Therefore, our model offers a combination of interconnected responsibilities, accountability, monitoring, and safety which is crucial for the protection of employees and the success of organizations. |

Traditional centralized FL systems suffer from serious issues. To address these concerns, decentralized federated learning (DFL) systems have been introduced in recent years. With the help of blockchains, they attempt to achieve more integrity and efficiency. However, privacy preservation remains an uncovered aspect of these systems. To tackle this, as well as to scale the blockchain-based computations, we propose a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based aggregator (zkDFL). This allows clients to share their large-scale model parameters with a trusted centralized server without revealing their individual data to other clients. We utilize blockchain technology to manage the aggregation algorithm via smart contracts. The server performs a ZKP algorithm to prove to the clients that the aggregation is done according to the accepted algorithm. Additionally, the server can prove that all inputs from clients have been used. We evaluate our approach using a public dataset related to the wearable Internet of Things. As demonstrated by numerical evaluations, zkDFL introduces verifiability of the correctness of the aggregation process and enhances the privacy protection and scalability of DFL systems, while the gas cost has significantly declined. |

|**2023-12-07**|**Dynamic Data-Driven Digital Twins for Blockchain Systems**|Georgios Diamantopoulos et.al.|[2312.04226](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04226)| In recent years, we have seen an increase in the adoption of blockchain-based systems in non-financial applications, looking to benefit from what the technology has to offer. Although many fields have managed to include blockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption of blockchain, in general, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-off between decentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous work, we have shown that using a digital twin for dynamically managing blockchain systems during runtime can be effective in managing the trilemma trade-off. Our Digital Twin leverages DDDAS feedback loop, which is responsible for getting the data from the system to the digital twin, conducting optimisation, and updating the physical system. This paper examines how leveraging DDDAS feedback loop can support the optimisation component of the trilemma benefiting from Reinforcement Learning agents and a simulation component to augment the quality of the learned model while reducing the computational overhead required for decision-making. |

Users can manipulate their crypto assets by simply sending emails with no need to manage keys. These emails are verified using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) along with their attached digital signatures that the sender domain server (SDS) generates according to DomainKeys Identified Mail. Unless the SDS forges the emails, the crypto assets remain secure in the proposed system. Moreover, the existing SDSs can be used as is by outsourcing additional work to a third party that is not necessarily trusted. The system supports various functions to manipulate crypto assets. We produced a tool for variable-regex mapping (VRM) that enables developers to build a new function without ZKP skills. For example, using the tool, we built a demo application where users can exchange crypto assets via Uniswap only with emails. The published version of this paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC56567.2023.10174932. |

However, DNS is vulnerable to some malicious attacks, including DNS cache poisoning, which redirects users to malicious websites displaying offensive or illegal content. Existing countermeasures often suffer from at least one of the following weakness: weak attack resistance, high overhead, or complex implementation. To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a blockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the forged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution process. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the credibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based incentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation. Importantly, TI-DNS is easy to be adopted as it only requires modifications to the resolver side of current DNS infrastructure. Finally, we develop a prototype and evaluate it against alternative solutions. The result demonstrates that TI-DNS effectively and efficiently solves DNS cache poisoning. |
|**2023-12-05**|**Blockchain Participation Games**|Pyrros Chaidos et.al.|[2312.02769](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02769)| We study game-theoretic models for capturing participation in blockchain systems. Permissionless blockchains can be naturally viewed as games, where a set of potentially interested users is faced with the dilemma of whether to engage with the protocol or not. Engagement here implies that the user will be asked to complete certain tasks, whenever they are selected to contribute (typically according to some stochastic process) and be rewarded if they choose to do so. Apart from the basic dilemma of engaging or not, even more strategic considerations arise in settings where users may be able to declare participation and then retract before completing their tasks (but are still able to receive rewards) or are rewarded independently of whether they contribute. Such variations occur naturally in the blockchain setting due to the complexity of tracking ``on-chain'' the behavior of the participants.   We capture these participation considerations offering a series of models that enable us to reason about the basic dilemma, the case where retraction effects influence the outcome and the case when payments are given universally irrespective of the stochastic process. In all cases we provide characterization results or necessary conditions on the structure of Nash equilibria. Our findings reveal that appropriate reward mechanisms can be used to stimulate participation and avoid negative effects of free riding, results that are in line but also can inform real world blockchain system deployments. |

Tokens are typically distributed to select users as a "reward" for engaging with the protocol, aiming to foster long-term community loyalty and sustained economic activity. Despite their prevalence, there is limited understanding of what makes an airdrop successful. This paper outlines the design space for airdrops and proposes key outcomes for an effective strategy. We analyze on-chain data from six large-scale airdrops to assess their success and find that a substantial portion of tokens is often sold off by "airdrop farmers." Based on this analysis, we highlight common pitfalls and offer guidelines for improving airdrop design. |

This paper presents MPFUZZ, the first mempool fuzzer to find asymmetric DoS bugs by symbolically exploring mempool state space and optimistically estimating the promisingness an intermediate state is in reaching bug oracles. Compared to the baseline blockchain fuzzers, MPFUZZ achieves a > 100x speedup in finding known DETER exploits. Running MPFUZZ on six major Ethereum clients leads to the discovering of new mempool vulnerabilities, which exhibit a wide variety of sophisticated patterns including stealthy mempool eviction and mempool locking. Rule-based mitigation schemes are proposed against newly discovered vulnerabilities. |

By amalgamating technologies like sensors and cloud computing, the IoV paves the way for optimized traffic management, heightened vehicle safety, and the birth of novel business paradigms. However, this growth is shadowed by significant security concerns, especially in the communication and payment sectors. Addressing the pressing need for secure Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and payments amidst rising cyber threats, this research introduces the Ethereum based Secure Payment and Communication Solution (ESP2CS). Utilizing Ethereum as a middleware, ESP2CS ensures robust and secure V2X interactions. The solution is complemented by an Android Auto application for vehicles, streamlining inter vehicle communication, parking space detection, and transaction management. Furthermore, dedicated Android applications are developed for parking space renters and the parking IoT system. Preliminary evaluations underscore ESP2CS's superior cost effectiveness, integrity and consistency over contemporary solutions, with Ethereum bolstering both security and efficiency. |

The use of blockchain technology in medical Internet of things systems can be considered a safe and novel solution to overcome such challenges. Patients with movement disorders require multi-disciplinary management and must continuously receive medical care from a specialist. Due to the increasing costs of face-to-face treatment, especially during the pandemic, patients would highly benefit from remote monitoring and management. The proposed work presents a model for blockchain-based remote management systems for patients with movement disorders, especially those with Parkinson's disease. The model ensures a high level of integrity and decreases the security risks of medical data sharing. |

Instead of spamming hashing operations to mine blocks, miners will be running Monte Carlo simulations to support a real-world HEP experiment with useful data. The block problems will be defined by a Root Authority which is represented by a HEP experiment like CBM. The focus in this publication is a mechanism that allows the Root Authority to select a winner from a list of nodes that solved a block problem. The mechanism is designed so that winner selection is deterministic, fair and transparent. This mechanism allows every node to verify the fairness of the winner selection process without giving the nodes a tool to be able to improve their own winning chances. |

Due to the transparency of permissionless blockchains, opportunistic traders can compete to earn revenue by extracting Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which undermines both the consensus security and efficiency of blockchain systems. The Flashbots bundle mechanism further aggravates the MEV competition because it empowers opportunistic traders with the capability of designing more sophisticated MEV extraction. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on DeFi MEV activities in Flashbots bundle by developing ActLifter, a novel automated tool for accurately identifying DeFi actions in transactions of each bundle, and ActCluster, a new approach that leverages iterative clustering to facilitate us to discover known/unknown DeFi MEV activities. Extensive experimental results show that ActLifter can achieve nearly 100% precision and recall in DeFi action identification, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, with the help of ActCluster, we obtain many new observations and discover 17 new kinds of DeFi MEV activities, which occur in 53.12% of bundles but have not been reported in existing studies |

Technological advances have brought major improvements to the operations of financial services. While these advances promote improved accessibility and convenience, traditional finance shortcomings like lack of transparency and moral hazard frictions continue to plague centralized platforms, imposing societal costs. In this paper, we argue how these shortcomings and frictions are being mitigated by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We delve into the workings of smart contracts, the backbone of DeFi transactions, with an emphasis on those underpinning token exchange and lending services. We highlight the pros and cons of the novel form of decentralized governance introduced via the ownership of governance tokens. Despite its potential, the current DeFi infrastructure introduces operational risks to users, which we segment into five primary categories: consensus mechanisms, protocol, oracle, frontrunning, and systemic risks. We conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to focus on the scalability of existing blockchains, the improved design and interoperability of DeFi protocols, and the rigorous auditing of smart contracts. |

Lee et.al.|[2312.00902](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00902)| Data science and artificial intelligence have become an indispensable part of scientific research. While such methods rely on high-quality and large quantities of machine-readable scientific data, the current scientific data infrastructure faces significant challenges that limit effective data curation and sharing. These challenges include insufficient return on investment for researchers to share quality data, logistical difficulties in maintaining long-term data repositories, and the absence of standardized methods for evaluating the relative importance of various datasets. To address these issues, this paper presents the Lennard Jones Token, a blockchain-based proof-of-concept solution implemented on the Ethereum network. The token system incentivizes users to submit optimized structures of Lennard Jones particles by offering token rewards, while also charging for access to these valuable structures. Utilizing smart contracts, the system automates the evaluation of submitted data, ensuring that only structures with energies lower than those in the existing database for a given cluster size are rewarded. The paper explores the details of the Lennard Jones Token as a proof of concept and proposes future blockchain-based tokens aimed at enhancing the curation and sharing of scientific data. |
|**2023-12-01**|**Crystal: Enhancing Blockchain Mining Transparency with Quorum Certificate**|Jianyu Niu et.al.|[2312.00741](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00741)| Researchers have discovered a series of theoretical attacks against Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus; the most damaging ones are selfish mining, double-spending, and consistency delay attacks. These attacks have one common cause: block withholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates to resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees from miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set of signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has to publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block withholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee election in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a reward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and evaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and double-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the total computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a probability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the success probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal end-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be introduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that prevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety proof. |

Aviation electronics (avionics) systems stand out as the application area of informatics methods in solving aviation problems or providing different capabilities to aircrafts. Avionics systems are electronic systems used in air and space vehicles for many purposes such as surveillance, navigation and communication. In this study, the applicability of blockchain technology as a new approach in the development of avionics systems is discussed, and in this regard, a method inspired by the previously implemented applications in electronic flight systems is proposed to help evaluate the applicability of this technology in new avionics system designs. The potential of blockchain for solving the problems especially in basic services, communication, navigation and flight management systems; the problem structures for which application of this technology would be a reliable solution; and the superiority and inferiority of its use in avionic systems are explained. A guiding paper is proposed for aviation engineers/experts to make a decision on applying blockchain into avionics systems. |

Moreover, the immutability of Blockchain technology makes deployed smart contracts unfixable for the whole life of the Blockchain itself. The lack of complete and up-to-date resources that explain those vulnerabilities in detail has also contributed to increasing the number of vulnerabilities in Blockchain. In addition, the lack of a standardized nomination of the existing vulnerabilities has made redundant research and made developers more confused. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the most complete list of smart contract vulnerabilities that exist in the most popular Blockchains with a detailed explanation of each one of them. In addition, we propose a new codification system that facilitates the communication of those vulnerabilities between developers and researchers. This codification, help identify the most uncovered vulnerabilities to focus on in future research. Moreover, the discussed list of vulnerabilities covers multiple Blockchain and could be used for even future built Blockchains. |

For instance, ChatGPT has attracted more than 100 million users in three months. Since the model training requires a lot of data and computing power, a well-performing deep learning model is behind a huge effort and cost. Facing various model attacks, unauthorized use and abuse from the network that threaten the interests of model owners, in addition to considering legal and other administrative measures, it is equally important to protect the model's copyright from the technical means. By using the model watermarking technology, we point out the possibility of building a unified platform for model ownership verification. Given the application history of blockchain in copyright verification and the drawbacks of a centralized third-party, this paper considers combining model watermarking technology and blockchain to build a unified model copyright protection platform. By a new solution we called Tokenized Model, it protects the model's copyright by reliable ownership record and verification mechanism. It also promotes the financial value of model by constructing the model's transaction process and contribution shares of a model. In the typical case study, we also study the various performance under usual scenario to verify the effectiveness of this platform. |

However, there are two thorny problems caused by unprotected communication methods: "parameter-leakage" and "inefficient-communication". This article proposes Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FBChain) model for federated learning parameter communication to overcome the above two problems. First, we utilize the immutability of blockchain to store the global model and hash value of local model parameters in case of tampering during the communication process, protect data privacy by encrypting parameters, and verify data consistency by comparing the hash values of local parameters, thus addressing the "parameter-leakage" problem. Second, the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm comprehensively selects nodes with the higher weighted link speed to aggregate global model and package blocks, thereby solving the "inefficient-communication" problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FBChain model and its ability to improve model communication efficiency in federated learning. |

The Safe-House is badly needed since there are many ongoing hacks and security concerns in the DeFi space right now. The Safe-House is a piece of engineering sophistication that utilizes existing blockchain principles to bring about greater security when customer assets are moved around. The Safe-House logic is easily implemented as smart contracts on any decentralized system. The amount of funds at risk from both internal and external parties -- and hence the maximum one time loss -- is guaranteed to stay within the specified limits based on cryptographic fundamentals.   To improve the safety of the Safe-House even further, we adapt the one time password (OPT) concept to operate using blockchain technology. Well suited to blockchain cryptographic nuances, our secondary advancement can be termed the one time next time password (OTNTP) mechanism. The OTNTP is designed to complement the Safe-House making it even more safe.   We provide a detailed threat assessment model -- discussing the risks faced by DeFi protocols and the specific risks that apply to blockchain fund management -- and give technical arguments regarding how these threats can be overcome in a robust manner. We discuss how the Safe-House can participate with other external yield generation protocols in a secure way. We provide reasons for why the Safe-House increases safety without sacrificing the efficiency of operation. We start with a high level intuitive description of the landscape, the corresponding problems and our solutions. We then supplement this overview with detailed discussions including the corresponding mathematical formulations and pointers for technological implementation. This approach ensures that the article is accessible to a broad audience. |

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for a blockchain-based decentralized system designed to tackle the escalating challenge of digital content integrity. The proposed system integrates advanced deep learning algorithms with the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where authenticity can be verified without relying on a single centralized authority. Furthermore, the system utilizes smart contracts for dynamic algorithm management and token-based incentives further enhances the system's effectiveness and adaptability. The decentralized architecture of the system democratizes the process of verifying digital content and introduces a novel approach to combat deepfakes. The collaborative and adjustable nature of this system sets a new benchmark for digital media integrity, offering a more robust digital media environment. |

A JIT liquidity provider (LP) monitors pending swap orders in public mempools of blockchains to sandwich orders of their choice with liquidity, depositing right before and withdrawing right after the order. Our game-theoretic model with asymmetrically informed agents reveals that a JIT LP's presence does not always enhance liquidity pool depth, as one might expect. While passive LPs face adverse selection by informed arbitrageurs, a JIT LP's ability to detect pending orders for toxic order flow prior to liquidity provision lets them avoid being adversely selected. JIT LPs thus only provide liquidity to uninformed orders and crowd out passive LPs when order volume is not sufficiently elastic to pool depth, possibly reducing overall market liquidity. We show that using a two-tiered fee structure which transfers a part of a JIT LP's fee revenue to passive LPs or allowing for JIT LPs to compete \`{a} la Cournot are potential solutions to mitigate the negative effects of JIT liquidity. |

It offers a theoretical framework and addresses a critical challenge facing decentralized governance by developing a method to identify Sybils, or spurious identities. Sybils pose significant organizational sustainability threats to DAOs and other, commons-based online communities, and threat models are identified. The experimental method uses an autoencoder architecture and graph deep learning techniques to identify Sybil activity in a DAO governance dataset (snapshot.org). Specifically, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) learned voting behaviours and a fast vector clustering algorithm used high-dimensional embeddings to identify similar nodes in a graph. The results reveal that deep learning can effectively identify Sybils, reducing the voting graph by 2-5%. This research underscores the importance of Sybil resistance in DAOs, identifies challenges and opportunities for forensics and analysis of anonymous networks, and offers a novel perspective on decentralized governance, informing future policy, regulation, and governance practices. |

The rise of blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined evolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting opportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market misconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by addressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by discussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of novel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and taxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis and empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi, shedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we investigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for DeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need enhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the regulatory perimeter. |

Since PCNs only allow path-based transactions, effective, secure routing protocols that find a path between a sender and receiver are fundamental to PCN operations. In this paper, we propose RACED, a routing protocol that leverages the idea of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to route transactions in PCNs in a fast and secure way. Our experiments on real-world transaction datasets show that RACED gives an average transaction success ratio of 98.74%, an average pathfinding time of 31.242 seconds, which is $1.65*10^3$, $1.8*10^3$, and $4*10^2$ times faster than three other recent routing protocols that offer comparable security/privacy properties. We rigorously analyze and prove the security of RACED in the Universal Composability framework. |
|**2023-11-29**|**Emergent Outcomes of the veToken Model**|Thomas Lloyd et.al.|[2311.17589](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17589)| Decentralised organisations use blockchains as a basis for governance: they use on-chain transactions to allocate voting weight, publish proposals, cast votes, and enact the results.   However, blockchain-based governance structures have challenges, mostly notably, the need to align the short-term outlook of pseudononymous voters with the long-term growth and success of the decentralised organisation. The Vote-Escrowed Token (veToken) model attempts to resolve this tension by requiring voters to escrow or lock tokens of value for an extended period in exchange for voting weight.   In this paper, we describe the veToken model and analyse its emergent outcomes. We show that voting behaviour follows bribes set by higher-level protocols, and that the cost per vote varies depending on how it is acquired. We describe the implementation of the veToken model by Curve Finance, a popular automated market maker for stablecoins, and the ecosystem of protocols that has arisen on top of this implementation. We show that voting markets such as Votium largely determine the outcome of fortnightly votes held by Convex Finance, and we show that Frax Finance, a stablecoin issuer, plays a central role in the ecosystem even though they directly lock relatively few tokens with Curve. Instead, they indirectly lock tokens through yield aggregators such as Convex Finance and purchase voting weight through voting markets such as Votium.   Although the veToken model in isolation is straight-forward and easily explained, it leads to many complex and emergent outcomes. Decentralised organisations should consider these outcomes before adopting the model. |

Also, suppose that each participant $P_i$ knows a secret value $x_i\in\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we will propose a protocol that enables the participants in this setup to calculate the value $y=H(m,x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_n)$ of a hash function $H:\mathcal{X}^{n+1}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}$ such that the function $H$ is a one-way function, participants in $P\backslash\{P_i\}$ cannot obtain $x_i$, participants other than the data owner cannot obtain $m$, and the hash value $y=H(m,x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_n)$ remains the same regardless the order of the secret $x_i$ values. |

Interoperability not only enhances the usability and reach of individual chains but also fosters collaboration, unlocking new opportunities for decentralized applications. In this paper, we introduce Eden, the parallel-verified messaging protocol powering SparkleX. Eden is an elastic, decentralized envoy network built on a zero-knowledge MapReduce framework (i.e., ZK-MapReduce), enabling ultra-fast, secure, and fully decentralized cross-chain communication. We explore Eden's design, its robust security model, and the innovative mechanisms that ensure its elasticity and resilience, even in demanding network environments. |
|**2023-11-29**|**Asynchronous Merkle Trees**|Anoushk Kharangate et.al.|[2311.17441](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17441)| Merkle trees have become a widely successful cryptographic data structure. Enabling a vast variety of applications from checking for inconsistencies in databases like Dynamo to essential tools like Git to large scale distributed systems like Bitcoin and other blockchains. There have also been various versions of Merkle trees like Jellyfish Merkle Trees and Sparse Merkle Trees designed for different applications. However, one key drawback of all these Merkle trees is that with a large data set the cost of computing the tree increases significantly, moreover insert operations on a single leaf require re-building the entire tree. For certain use cases building the tree this way is acceptable, however in environments where compute time needs to be as low as possible and where data is processed in parallel, we are presented with a need for asynchronous computation. This paper proposes a solution where given a batch of data that has to be processed concurrently, a Merkle Tree can be constructed from the batch asynchronously without needing to recalculate the tree for every insert. |
|**2023-11-28**|**Blockchain-based Zero Trust on the Edge**|Cem Bicer et.al.|[2311.16744](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16744)| Internet of Things (IoT) devices pose significant security challenges due to their heterogeneity (i.e., hardware and software) and vulnerability to extensive attack surfaces. Today's conventional perimeter-based systems use credential-based authentication (e.g., username/password, certificates, etc.) to decide whether an actor can access a network. However, the verification process occurs only at the system's perimeter because most IoT devices lack robust security measures due to their limited hardware and software capabilities, making them highly vulnerable. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) extended with blockchain to further enhance security. The blockchain component serves as an immutable database for storing users' requests and is used to verify trustworthiness by analyzing and identifying potentially malicious user activities. We discuss the framework, processes of the approach, and the experiments carried out on a testbed to validate its feasibility and applicability in the smart city context. Lastly, the evaluation focuses on non-functional properties such as performance, scalability, and complexity. |

Therefore, the present work describes MinIndy, a tool designed to simplify the installation and configuration of Hyperledger Indy networks. This simplification will allow people with a lower level of expertise to create their Indy networks. Which makes it a viable alternative for organizations looking to adopt Hyperledger Indy Blockchain networks with less effort. |

Reasons for the difficulty of benchmarking blockchains include, for example, the high number of system parameters to configure and the effort to deploy a blockchain network. In addition, performance data, which mostly comes from system vendors, is often intransparent. We investigate and evaluate the performance of seven permissioned blockchain systems using different parameter settings in a reproducible manner. We employ an end-to-end approach, where the clients sending the transactions are fully involved in the data collection approach. Our results highlight the peculiarities and limitations of the systems under investigation. Due to the insights given, our work forms the basis for continued research to optimise the performance of blockchain systems. |

Contrary to popular belief, it raises security and privacy issues as it is used to collect data from consumers or automated systems. Numerous articles are published that discuss issues like centralised control systems and potential alternatives like integration with blockchain. Although a few recent surveys focused on the challenges and solutions facing the IoT ecosystem, most of them did not concentrate on the threats, difficulties, or blockchain-based solutions. Additionally, none of them focused on blockchain and IoT integration challenges and attacks. In the context of the IoT ecosystem, overall security measures are very important to understand the overall challenges. This article summarises difficulties that have been outlined in numerous recent articles and articulates various attacks and security challenges in a variety of approaches, including blockchain-based solutions and so on. More clearly, this contribution consolidates threats, access control issues, and remedies in brief. In addition, this research has listed some attacks on public blockchain protocols with some real-life examples that can guide researchers in taking preventive measures for IoT use cases. Finally, a future research direction concludes the research gaps by analysing contemporary research contributions. |

By analysing news and social media content, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we assess the impact of public sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model to detect bullish and bearish trends, significantly advancing beyond traditional sentiment analysis. Additionally, we systematically compare a range of pre-trained and fine-tuned deep learning NLP models against conventional dictionary-based sentiment analysis methods. Another key contribution of our work is the adoption of local extrema alongside daily price movements as predictive targets, reducing trading frequency and portfolio volatility. Our findings demonstrate that integrating textual data into cryptocurrency price forecasting not only improves forecasting accuracy but also consistently enhances the profitability and Sharpe ratio across various validation scenarios, particularly when applying deep learning NLP techniques. The entire codebase of our experiments is made available via an online repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crypto-forecasting-public |

Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose significant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these attack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities, then strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures their transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included in the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a comprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running attacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter each type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method named FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary Classification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions within decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate classification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement, insertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting front-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%. |

Federated learning (FL) and blockchain technologies have emerged as promising approaches to address these challenges by enabling decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving model training on distributed data sources. In this paper, we present a novel IoT solution that combines the incremental learning vector quantization algorithm (XuILVQ) with Ethereum blockchain technology to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing, model training, and prototype storage in a distributed environment. Our proposed architecture addresses the shortcomings of existing blockchain-based FL solutions by reducing computational and communication overheads while maintaining data privacy and security. We assess the performance of our system through a series of experiments, showcasing its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning tasks in IoT settings. |

It formally characterizes a novel class of distributed objects that only requires a First In First Out (FIFO) order on the object operations from each process (taken individually). The formalization leverages Mazurkiewicz traces to define legal sequences of operations and ensure both Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) and Pipleline Consistency (PC). The paper presents a generic algorithm that implements this novel class of distributed objects both in a crash- and Byzantine setting. It also illustrates the practical interest of the proposed approach using four instances of this class of objects, namely money transfer, Petri nets, multi-sets, and concurrent work stealing dequeues. |

Driven by the latest advances in cutting-edge technologies, Web 3.0 is moving towards a more open, decentralized, intelligent, and interconnected network. However, increasingly widespread data breaches have raised awareness of online privacy and security of personal data. Additionally, since Web 3.0 is a sophisticated and complex convergence, the technical details behind it are not as clear as the characteristics it presents. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth exploration of Web 3.0 from the perspectives of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and edge computing. Specifically, we begin with summarizing the evolution of the Internet and providing an overview of these three key technological factors. Afterward, we provide a thorough analysis of each technology separately, including its relevance to Web 3.0, key technology components, and practical applications. We also propose decentralized storage and computing solutions by exploring the integration of technologies. Finally, we highlight the key challenges alongside potential research directions. Through the combination and mutual complementation of multiple technologies, Web 3.0 is expected to return more control and ownership of data and digital assets back to users. |
|**2024-07-03**|**Gradual Verification for Smart Contracts**|Haojia Sun et.al.|[2311.13351](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13351)| Blockchains facilitate secure resource transactions through smart contracts, yet these digital agreements are prone to vulnerabilities, particularly when interacting with external contracts, leading to substantial monetary losses. Traditional verification techniques fall short in providing comprehensive security assurances, especially against re-entrancy attacks, due to the unavailable implementations of external contracts. This paper introduces an incremental approach: gradual verification. We combine static and dynamic verification techniques to enhance security, guarantee soundness and flexibility, and optimize resource usage in smart contract interactions. By implementing a prototype for gradually verifying Algorand smart contracts via the pyTEAL language, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, contributing to the safe and efficient execution of smart contracts. |
|**2023-11-21**|**Serial Monopoly on Blockchains**|Noam Nisan et.al.|[2311.12731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12731)| We study the following problem that is motivated by Blockchains where ``miners'' are serially given the monopoly for assembling transactions into the next block. Our model has a single good that is sold repeatedly every day where new demand for the good arrives every day. The novel element in our model is that all unsatisfied demand from one day remains in the system and is added to the new demand of the next day. Every day there is a new monopolist that gets to sell a fixed supply $s$ of the good and naturally chooses to do so at the monopolist's price for the combined demand. What will the dynamics of the prices chosen by the sequence of monopolists be? What level of efficiency will be obtained in the long term?   We start with a non-strategic analysis of users' behavior and our main result shows that prices keep fluctuating wildly and this is an endogenous property of the model and happens even when demand is stable with nothing stochastic in the model. These price fluctuations underscore the necessity of an analysis under strategic behavior of the users, which we show results in the prices being stable at the market equilibrium price. |
|**2023-11-21**|**Heuristics for Detecting CoinJoin Transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain**|Hugo Schnoering et.al.|[2311.12491](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12491)| This research delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and its associated blockchain, which records all transactions since its inception. While this ensures integrity and transparency, the transparent nature of Bitcoin potentially compromises users' privacy rights. To address this concern, users have adopted CoinJoin, a method that amalgamates multiple transaction intents into a single, larger transaction to bolster transactional privacy. This process complicates individual transaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis heuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on identifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin implementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting distinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study delves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming to develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the blockchain. Our exhaustive analysis covers transactions up to block 760,000, offering a comprehensive insight into CoinJoin transactions and their implications for Bitcoin blockchain analysis. |

Given the imminent quantum computing adversarial scenario, conventional cryptographic methods face vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's secure randomness, we adopt post-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for synthesizing pseudo-random sequences. Considering computational costs and resultant on-chain gas costs, we suggest a bifurcated architecture for VRF design, optimizing interactions between on-chain and off-chain. Our approach employs a secure ring signature supported by NIZK proof and a delegated key generation method, inspired by the Chaum-Pedersen equality proof and the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Our VRF scheme integrates multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DID), ensuring both security and randomness. We elucidate the security and privacy aspects of our VRF scheme, analyzing temporal and spatial complexities. We also approximate the entropy of the VRF scheme and detail its implementation in a Solidity contract. Also, we delineate a method for validating the VRF's proof, matching for the contexts requiring both randomness and verification. Conclusively, using the NIST SP800-22 of the statistical randomness test suite, our results exhibit a 98.86% pass rate over 11 test cases, with an average p-value of 0.5459 from 176 total tests. |

Banks and remittance organisations have shown a growing interest in exploring blockchain's potential advantages over traditional practices. This paper presents a data-driven predictive decision support approach as an innovative artefact designed for the blockchain-oriented remittance industry. Employing a theory-generating Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we have uncovered the emergence of predictive capabilities driven by transactional big data. The artefact integrates predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) to enable real-time remittance monitoring, empowering management decision-makers to address challenges in the uncertain digitised landscape of blockchain-oriented remittance companies. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this research not only enhances the security of the remittance ecosystem but also lays the foundation for future predictive decision support solutions, extending the potential of predictive analytics to other domains. Additionally, the generated theory from the artifact's implementation enriches the DSR approach and fosters grounded and stakeholder theory development in the information systems domain. |

Federated learning lays the groundwork for collaborative research in areas where the data is sensitive. Federated learning has several implications for real-world problems. In times of crisis, when real-time decision-making is critical, federated learning allows multiple entities to work collectively without sharing sensitive data. This distributed approach enables us to leverage information from multiple sources and gain more diverse insights. This paper is a systematic review of the literature on privacy-preserving machine learning in the last few years based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, we have presented an extensive review of supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms, ensemble methods, meta-heuristic approaches, blockchain technology, and reinforcement learning used in the framework of federated learning, in addition to an overview of federated learning applications. This paper reviews the literature on the components of federated learning and its applications in the last few years. The main purpose of this work is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of federated learning from the machine learning point of view. A discussion of some open problems and future research directions in federated learning is also provided. |

However, the increasing transaction volumes and limited on-chain storage underscore scalability as a key challenge hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Fortunately, off-chain networks that enable transactions outside the blockchain show promising potential to mitigate the scalability challenge. Off-chain solutions that address blockchain scalability hurdles, such as payment channel networks, facilitate secure and fast off-chain transactions, thus relieving the main chain's strain. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of key technologies, solutions, and challenges of off-chain networks. First, we introduce the background of off-chain networks encompassing design motivation, framework, overview, and application scenarios. We then review the key issues and technologies associated with off-chain networks. Subsequently, we summarize the mainstream solutions for the corresponding key issues. Finally, we discuss some research challenges and open issues in this area. |

This provides a total ordering on a set of global transactions. However, total ordering is not enough to satisfy application semantics under the Byzantine fault model. This is due to the fact that malicious miners and clients can collaborate to add their own transactions ahead of correct clients' transactions in order to gain application level and financial advantages. These attacks fall under the umbrella of front-running attacks. Therefore, total ordering is not strong enough to preserve application semantics. In this paper, we propose causality preserving total order as a solution to this problem. The resulting Blockchains will be stronger than traditional consensus based blockchains and will provide enhanced security ensuring correct application semantics in a Byzantine setting. |

This evaluation was conducted with the recent Diablo benchmark suite, a framework to evaluate the performance of different blockchains on the same ground. By tuning network delays in our controlled environment we were able to reproduce performance trends obtained in geo-distributed settings, hence demonstrating the relevance of bare metal evaluations to better understand blockchain performance. |

Consensus applications include fundamental services for the environments of the Cloud and Blockchain, and in such challenging environments, malicious behaviors are often modeled as adversarial Byzantine faults.   At OPODIS 2010, Mostefaoui and Raynal (in short MR) presented a Byzantine-tolerant solution to consensus in which the decided value cannot be a value proposed only by Byzantine processes. MR has optimal resilience coping with up to t < n/3 Byzantine nodes over n processes. MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from a finite set of values) assuming the availability of a single Binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from the set {0,1}).   This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an even more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine, self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact).   To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution for intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. Our solution has a O(t) stabilization time from arbitrary transient faults. |

However, the underlying infrastructure of this decentralized ecosystem often relies on centralized cloud providers, creating a paradoxical concentration of value and power. This paper investigates the mechanics of value accrual and extraction within the Web3 ecosystem, focusing on the roles and revenues of centralized clouds. Through an analysis of publicly available material, we elucidate the financial implications of cloud services in purportedly decentralized contexts. We further explore the individual's perspective of value creation and accumulation, examining the interplay between user participation and centralized monetization strategies. Key findings indicate that while blockchain technology has the potential to significantly reduce infrastructure costs for financial services, the current Web3 landscape is marked by a substantial reliance on cloud providers for hosting, scalability, and performance. |
|**2024-05-24**|**SeDe: Balancing Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance by Selective De-Anonymization**|Naveen Sahu et.al.|[2311.08167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08167)| Privacy is one of the essential pillars for the widespread adoption of blockchains, but public blockchains are transparent by nature. Modern analytics techniques can easily subdue the pseudonymity feature of a blockchain user. Some applications have been able to provide practical privacy protections using privacy-preserving cryptography techniques. However, malicious actors have abused them illicitly, discouraging honest actors from using privacy-preserving applications as "mixing" user interactions and funds with anonymous bad actors, causing compliance and regulatory concerns.   In this paper, we propose a framework that balances privacy-preserving features by establishing a regulatory and compliant framework called Selective De-Anonymization (SeDe). The adoption of this framework allows privacy-preserving applications on blockchains to de-anonymize illicit transactions by recursive traversal of subgraphs of linked transactions. Our technique achieves this without leaving de-anonymization decisions or control in the hands of a single entity but distributing it among multiple entities while holding them accountable for their respective actions. To instantiate, our framework uses threshold encryption schemes and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). |
|**2023-11-15**|**All Byzantine Agreement Problems are Expensive**|Pierre Civit et.al.|[2311.08060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08060)| Byzantine agreement, arguably the most fundamental problem in distributed computing, operates among n processes, out of which t < n can exhibit arbitrary failures. The problem states that all correct (non-faulty) processes must eventually decide (termination) the same value (agreement) from a set of admissible values defined by the proposals of the processes (validity). Depending on the exact version of the validity property, Byzantine agreement comes in different forms, from Byzantine broadcast to strong and weak consensus, to modern variants of the problem introduced in today's blockchain systems. Regardless of the specific flavor of the agreement problem, its communication cost is a fundamental metric whose improvement has been the focus of decades of research. The Dolev-Reischuk bound, one of the most celebrated results in distributed computing, proved 40 years ago that, at least for Byzantine broadcast, no deterministic solution can do better than Omega(t^2) exchanged messages in the worst case. Since then, it remained unknown whether the quadratic lower bound extends to seemingly weaker variants of Byzantine agreement. This paper answers the question in the affirmative, closing this long-standing open problem. Namely, we prove that any non-trivial agreement problem requires Omega(t^2) messages to be exchanged in the worst case. To prove the general lower bound, we determine the weakest Byzantine agreement problem and show, via a novel indistinguishability argument, that it incurs Omega(t^2) exchanged messages. |

To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making and blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message exchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message broadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission delay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network. Therefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed structure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach consistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus cannot be directly deployed. This article reviews several existing consensus mechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms that apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in CAS. To deploy wireless-adapted consensus, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based message structure to build a non-equivocation data dissemination protocol for CAS, which has resilience against message loss and unpredictable forwarding latency. Finally, we enhance this protocol by developing a two-dimension DAG-based strategy to achieve partial order for blockchain and total order for the distributed service model SMR. |

In this paper we propose a softmax aggregation blockchain based federated learning framework. First, we propose a new blockchain based federated learning architecture that utilizes the well-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on an existing blockchain network to select validators and miners to aggregate the participants' updates and compute the blocks. Second, to ensure the robustness of the aggregation process, we design a novel softmax aggregation method based on approximated population loss values that relies on our specific blockchain architecture. Additionally, we show our softmax aggregation technique converges to the global minimum in the convex setting with non-restricting assumptions. Our comprehensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing robust aggregation algorithms in various settings by large margins. |

The current centralized data-sharing paradigm in these systems raises particular concerns about data privacy. Recognizing these challenges, the shift towards decentralized interactions in technology, as echoed by the principles of Industry 5.0, becomes paramount. This work is closely aligned with these principles, emphasizing decentralized, human-centric, and secure technological interactions in an interconnected vehicular ecosystem. To embody this, we propose a practical approach that merges two emerging technologies: Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain. The integration of these technologies enables the creation of a decentralized vehicular network. In this setting, vehicles can learn from each other without compromising privacy while also ensuring data integrity and accountability. Initial experiments show that compared to conventional decentralized federated learning techniques, our proposed approach significantly enhances the performance and security of vehicular networks. The system's accuracy stands at 91.92\%. While this may appear to be low in comparison to state-of-the-art federated learning models, our work is noteworthy because, unlike others, it was achieved in a malicious vehicle setting. Despite the challenging environment, our method maintains high accuracy, making it a competent solution for preserving data privacy in vehicular networks. |
|**2023-11-10**|**Deep Learning meets Blockchain for Automated and Secure Access Control**|Asma Jodeiri Akbarfam et.al.|[2311.06236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06236)| Access control is a critical component of computer security, governing access to system resources. However, designing policies and roles in traditional access control can be challenging and difficult to maintain in dynamic and complex systems, which is particularly problematic for organizations with numerous resources. Furthermore, traditional methods suffer from issues such as third-party involvement, inefficiency, and privacy gaps, making transparent and dynamic access control an ongoing research problem. Moreover detecting malicious activities and identifying users who are not behaving appropriately can present notable difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose DLACB, a Deep Learning Based Access Control Using Blockchain, as a solution to decentralized access control. DLACB uses blockchain to provide transparency, traceability, and reliability in various domains such as medicine, finance, and government while taking advantage of deep learning to not rely on predefined policies and eventually automate access control. With the integration of blockchain and deep learning for access control, DLACB can provide a general framework applicable to various domains, enabling transparent and reliable logging of all transactions. As all data is recorded on the blockchain, we have the capability to identify malicious activities. We store a list of malicious activities in the storage system and employ a verification algorithm to cross-reference it with the blockchain. We conduct measurements and comparisons of the smart contract processing time for the deployed access control system in contrast to traditional access control methods, determining the time overhead involved. The processing time of DLBAC demonstrates remarkable stability when exposed to increased request volumes. |

Fries et.al.|[2311.05966](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05966)| We propose a lean and functional transaction scheme to establish a secure delivery-versus-payment across two blockchains, where a) no intermediary is required and b) the operator of the payment chain/payment system has a small overhead and does not need to store state. The main idea comes with two requirements: First, the payment chain operator hosts a stateless decryption service that allows decrypting messages with his secret key. Second, a "Payment Contract" is deployed on the payment chain that implements a function transferAndDecrypt(uint id, address from, address to, string keyEncryptedSuccess, string keyEncryptedFail) that processes the (trigger-based) payment and emits the decrypted key depending on the success or failure of the transaction. The respective key can then trigger an associated transaction, e.g. claiming delivery by the buyer or re-claiming the locked asset by the seller. |

Such attention is a consequence of the revenue that can be generated from MEV, as well as the risks MEV poses to the fundamental value proposition of the underlying blockchain technology. In this work, we provide an information-theoretic formulation of MEV. With this formulation, we make common statements about MEV mathematically rigorous. For example, we show that i) all non-trivial blockchains and decentralised applications must generate MEV; ii) how MEV can be reduced at the expense of user expressibility; and iii) how MEV can be good or bad from an information theoretic standpoint. |

Tackling scalability while preserving the security and decentralization of the network is a significant challenge. To deliver effective scaling solutions, Ethereum achieved a major protocol improvement, including a change in the consensus mechanism towards Proof of Stake. This improvement aimed a vast reduction of the hardware requirements to run a node, leading to significant sustainability benefits with a lower network energy consumption. This work analyzes the resource usage behavior of different clients running as Ethereum consensus nodes, comparing their performance under different configurations and analyzing their differences. Our results show higher requirements than claimed initially and how different clients react to network perturbations. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between the consensus clients, including their strong points and limitations. |

We then construct a hybrid quantum-classical search algorithm and analyze its success probability. Regarding the former, for search problems that are allowed to have multiple solutions and in which the input is sampled according to arbitrary distributions we establish their hybrid quantum-classical query complexities -- i.e., given a fixed number of classical and quantum queries, determine what is the probability of solving the search task. At a technical level, our results generalize the framework for hybrid quantum-classical search algorithms proposed by Rosmanis. Namely, for an arbitrary distribution $D$ on Boolean functions, the probability an algorithm equipped with $\tau_c$ classical and $\tau_q$ quantum queries succeeds in finding a preimage of $1$ for a function sampled from $D$ is at most $\nu_D \cdot(2\sqrt{\tau_c} + 2\tau_q + 1)^2$, where $\nu_D$ captures the average (over $D$) fraction of preimages of $1$. As applications of our hardness results, we first revisit and generalize the security of the Bitcoin protocol called the Bitcoin backbone, to a setting where the adversary has both quantum and classical capabilities, presenting a new hybrid honest majority condition necessary for the protocol to properly operate. Secondly, we examine the generic security of hash functions against hybrid adversaries. Regarding our second contribution, we design a hybrid algorithm which first spends all of its classical queries and in the second stage runs a ``modified Grover'' where the initial state depends on the distribution $D$ . We show how to analyze its success probability for arbitrary target distributions and, importantly, its optimality for the uniform and the Bernoulli distribution cases. |

This paper explores how smart contracts and blockchain can be used to create a transparent and secure ledger for tracking charitable donations. We highlight the limitations of traditional donation systems and how a blockchain-based system can help overcome these challenges. The functionality of smart contracts in donation tracking, offering advantages such as automation, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced accountability, is elucidated. The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology is emphasized for increased transparency and fraud prevention. While elucidating the benefits, we also address challenges in implementing such a system, including the need for technical expertise and security considerations. By fostering trust and accountability, a donation-tracking system in Web 3.0, empowered by smart blockchain networks, aims to catalyze a profound positive impact in the realm of philanthropy. |

The dynamics of ledger's development can be mathematically represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this paper, we study a DAG model which considers batch arrivals and random delay of attachment. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of this model by letting the arrival rate goes to infinity and the inter arrival time goes to zero. We establish that the number of leaves in the DAG and various random variables characterizing the vertices in the DAG can be approximated by its fluid limit, represented as delayed partial differential equations. Furthermore, we establish the stable state of this fluid limit and validate our findings through simulations. |

Many scholars are dedicated to improving its verifiability, scalability, and performance based on sharding techniques, including grouping nodes and handling cross-shard transactions. However, they ignore the node vulnerability problem, i.e., there is no guarantee that nodes will not be maliciously controlled throughout their life cycle. Facing this challenge, we propose RecAGT, a novel identification scheme aimed at reducing communication overhead and identifying potential malicious nodes. First, shard testable codes are designed to encode the original data in case of a leak of confidential data. Second, a new identity proof protocol is presented as evidence against malicious behavior. Finally, adaptive group testing is chosen to identify malicious nodes. Notably, our work focuses on the internal operation within the committee and can thus be applied to any sharding permissioned blockchains. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can effectively identify malicious nodes with low communication and computational costs. |

In this article, we investigate the decentralization in the governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) using the Gini coefficient as an indicator of inequality among the token owners. This metric is analyzed in the context of Return on Investment (ROI) for companies in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Our goal is to understand whether the level of "real" decentralization in blockchain-based governance affects financial efficiency, and to explore the benefits and possible limitations of such an approach. This analysis allows for a deeper understanding of the significance and impact of decentralization on the functioning and productivity of organizations in the DeFi sector, and to determine the extent to which this impact is positively or negatively reflected in their success and profitability. Additionally, the results of this analysis will provide a fuller understanding of the dynamics and potential of blockchain for organization governance. |

It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances. |

The blockchain (BC) guarantees task-offloading privacy, but cost reduction, queueing delays, and redundancy elimination remain open problems. This paper presents a redundancy-aware BC-based approach for the metaverse's partial computation offloading (PCO). Specifically, we formulate a joint BC redundancy factor (BRF) and PCO problem to minimize computation costs, maximize incentives, and meet delay and BC offloading constraints. We proved this problem is NP-hard and transformed it into two subproblems based on their temporal correlation: real-time PCO and Markov decision process-based BRF. We formulated the PCO problem as a multiuser game, proposed a decentralized algorithm for Nash equilibrium under any BC redundancy state, and designed a double deep Q-network-based algorithm for the optimal BRF policy. The BRF strategy is updated periodically based on user computation demand and network status to assist the PCO algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing schemes, resulting in a remarkable 47% reduction in cost overhead, delivering approximately 64% higher rewards, and achieving convergence in just a few training episodes. |

In particular, the "Superbonus 110" tax relief in 2020, offering a generous 110% deduction for expenses related to energy efficiency improvements and seismic risk reduction in buildings, has played a pivotal role. However, the surge in construction activities has also brought about an unfortunate increase in fraudulent activities. To address this challenge, our research introduces a practical system for monitoring and managing the entire process of the Superbonus 110 tax credit, from its initiation to redemption. This system leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to streamline tax credit management and incorporates controllers based on a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation architecture, bolstered by a Multi-agent System. The outcome of our work is a system capable of establishing a tokenomics framework that caters to the needs and functionalities of both investors and operators. Moreover, it features a robust control system to prevent inadvertent errors like double spending, overspending, and deceitful practices such as false claims of completed work. The collaborative approach between the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation and the Multi-agent System enhances trust and security levels among participants in a competitive environment where potential fraudsters might attempt to exploit the system. It also enables comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the entire Superbonus process. In the realm of engineering, our project represents an innovative fusion of blockchain technology and Multi-agent Systems, advancing the application of artificial intelligence. This integration guarantees the validation, recording, and execution of transactions with a remarkable level of trust and transparency. |

While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of their governance mechanisms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research articles, we develop a taxonomy to categorize these governance issues. We collect and build a dataset of 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies, categorizing their governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. We conducted a thorough analysis of governance issues and identified vulnerabilities in governance design and implementation, e.g., voting sybil attack and proposal front-running. Our findings highlight a significant observation: the disparity between smart contract code and DeFi whitepapers plays a central role in these governance issues. As an initial step to address the challenges of code-whitepaper consistency checks for DeFi applications, we built a machine-learning-based prototype, and validated its performance on eight widely used DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Our study culminates in providing several key practical implications for various DeFi stakeholders, including developers, users, researchers, and regulators, aiming to deepen the understanding of DeFi governance issues and contribute to the robust growth of DeFi systems. |

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency. |

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis remains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized expert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted data.   Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise predictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data repositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent privacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution harnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy, facilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI analysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection architecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various issues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI images.   Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly on the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost constraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain securely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our decentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease predictions. By merging the strengths of blockchain, AI, and anomaly detection, our system represents a pioneering step towards revolutionizing disease diagnostics. |

Ever since the inception of Bitcoin, blockchain teams have incorporated the concept of open source code as a fundamental principle, thus making the majority of blockchain-based projects' code and version control data available for analysis. We define health in open source software projects to be a combination of the concepts of sustainability, robustness, and niche occupation. Sustainability is further divided into interest and engagement. This work uses exploratory factor analysis to identify latent constructs that are representative of general public interest or popularity in software, and software robustness within open source blockchain projects. We find that interest is a combination of stars, forks, and text mentions in the GitHub repository, while a second factor for robustness is composed of a criticality score, time since last updated, numerical rank, and geographic distribution. Cross validation of the dataset is carried out with good support for the model. A structural model of software health is proposed such that general interest positively influences developer engagement, which, in turn, positively predicts software robustness. The implications of structural equation modelling in the context of software engineering and next steps are discussed. |

Our strategy involves developing blockchain-based NFT certifications that can be shared with institutions or employers using blockchain addresses. Students may access the data created by each individual institute in a single platform, filter the view of the relevant courses according to their requirements, and mint their certificate metadata as NFTs. This method provides accountability of access, comprehensive records that are permanently maintained in IPFS, and verifiable provenance for creating, distributing, and accessing certificates. It also makes it possible to share certificates more safely and efficiently. By incorporating trust factors through data provenance, our system provides a countermeasure against issues such as fake and duplicate certificates. It addresses the challenge of the traditional certificate verification processes, which are lengthy manual process. With this system, students can manage and validate their academic credentials from multiple institutions in one location while ensuring authenticity and confidentiality using digital signatures and hashing for data protection against unauthorized access. Overall, our suggested system ensures data safety, accountability, and confidentiality while offering a novel approach to certificate distribution. |

Maciel et.al.|[2310.19999](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19999)| Interoperability has been a focus of attention over at least four decades, with the emergence of several interoperability types (or levels), diverse models, frameworks, and solutions, also as a result of a continuous effort from different domains. The current heterogeneity in technologies such as blockchain, IoT and new application domains such as Industry 4.0 brings not only new interaction possibilities but also challenges for interoperability. Moreover, confusion and ambiguity in the current understanding of interoperability types exist, hampering stakeholders' communication and decision making. This work presents an updated panorama of software-intensive systems interoperability with particular attention to its types. For this, we conducted a tertiary study that scrutinized 37 secondary studies published from 2012 to 2023, from which we found 36 interoperability types associated with 117 different definitions, besides 13 interoperability models and six frameworks in various domains. This panorama reveals that the concern with interoperability has migrated from technical to social-technical issues going beyond the software systems' boundary and still requiring solving many open issues. We also address the urgent actions and also potential research opportunities to leverage interoperability as a multidisciplinary research field to achieve low-coupled, cost-effective, and interoperable systems. |

In the present work we study capitalization, floor price, the number of transactions, the inter-transaction times, and the transaction volume value of a few selected popular token collections. The results show that the fluctuations of all these quantities are characterized by heavy-tailed probability distribution functions, in most cases well described by the stretched exponentials, with a trace of power-law scaling at times, long-range memory, and in several cases even the fractal organization of fluctuations, mostly restricted to the larger fluctuations, however. We conclude that the NFT market - even though young and governed by a somewhat different mechanisms of trading - shares several statistical properties with the regular financial markets. However, some differences are visible in the specific quantitative indicators. |

Existing methods typically record transactions happening in a supply chain on a single blockchain and are limited in their ability to deal with different levels of data visibility. To address this limitation, we present FoodFresh -- a multi-chain consortium where organizations store immutable data on their blockchains. A decentralized hub coordinates the cross-chain exchange of digital assets among the heterogeneous blockchains. Mechanisms for enabling blockchain interoperability help to preserve the benefits of independent sovereign blockchains while allowing for data sharing across blockchain boundaries. |

Traditional authentication methods are no longer considered reliable due to their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Biometric authentication, particularly fingerprint authentication, has emerged as a promising alternative, but it raises concerns about the storage and use of biometric data, as well as centralized storage, which could make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based fingerprint authentication system is proposed that integrates zk-SNARKs, which are zero-knowledge proofs that enable secure and efficient authentication without revealing sensitive biometric information. A KNN-based approach on the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets is used to generate a cancelable template for secure, faster, and robust biometric registration and authentication which is stored using the Interplanetary File System. The proposed approach provides an average accuracy of 99.01%, 98.97% and 98.52% over the FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets respectively for fingerprint authentication. Incorporation of zk-SNARK facilitates smaller proof size. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to provide a secure and efficient solution for blockchain-based identity management. |

A secured identity management system ensures both security and the efficient provision of services for the host nation and the donor organizations. Realizing the benefits, a handful of studies enriched the blockchain-based security identification for refugees. The research studies presented the introductory, conceptual, and practical solution related to the blockchain-based smart contract. There is a common agreement in the studies that blockchain-based smart contract not only streamlines refugee identity verification but also safeguards against unauthorized entries. Since it is a technology as well, it has been essential to know the present status of the technology in the social context. In such a situation it becomes essential to review the existing research studies to provide insight for future studies. In this study, we reviewed current studies using a thematic approach. Our findings suggest researchers are more inclined to provide conceptual models as the models are important in advancing technology; however, the models need to be implemented for practical advances. However, the main contribution of this study is that this study gathers current efforts in smart contract-based refugee identity management. This study is important for the refugee host nations as well as for stakeholders. Knowledge gained from the study is expected to provide insight into how the technology can be developed using existing theory and implementation frameworks. |

Jeenath Laila et.al.|[2310.18668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18668)| In the digital age, it is crucial to make sure that financial transactions are as secure and reliable as possible. This abstract offers a ground-breaking method that combines smart contracts, blockchain technology, FaceNet512 for improved face recognition, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for speech authentication to create a system for video and audio verification that is unmatched. Smart contracts and the immutable ledger of the blockchain are combined to offer a safe and open environment for financial transactions. FaceNet512 and GMM offer multi-factor biometric authentication simultaneously, enhancing security to new heights. By combining cutting-edge technology, this system offers a strong defense against identity theft and illegal access, establishing a new benchmark for safe financial transactions. |

Understanding the Security of Coin-based Voting Governance**|Chao Li et.al.|[2310.18596](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18596)| Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model. |

By integrating GAI into modern Internet of Things (IoT), Generative Internet of Things (GIoT) is emerging and holds immense potential to revolutionize various aspects of society, enabling more efficient and intelligent IoT applications, such as smart surveillance and voice assistants. In this article, we present the concept of GIoT and conduct an exploration of its potential prospects. Specifically, we first overview four GAI techniques and investigate promising GIoT applications. Then, we elaborate on the main challenges in enabling GIoT and propose a general GAI-based secure incentive mechanism framework to address them, in which we adopt Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) for incentive mechanism designs and apply blockchain technologies for secure GIoT management. Moreover, we conduct a case study on modern Internet of Vehicle traffic monitoring, which utilizes GDMs to generate effective contracts for incentivizing users to contribute sensing data with high quality. Finally, we suggest several open directions worth investigating for the future popularity of GIoT. |
|**2024-10-30**|**Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus**|Sam Blackshear et.al.|[2310.18042](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18042)| Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration. |

As a virtual world independent of the real world, the metaverse will provide users with a variety of virtual activities that bring great convenience to society. In addition, the metaverse can facilitate digital twins, which offers transformative possibilities for the industry. Thus, the metaverse has attracted the attention of the industry, and a huge amount of capital is about to be invested. However, the development of the metaverse is still in its infancy and little research has been undertaken so far. We describe the development of the metaverse. Next, we introduce the architecture of the socially beneficial metaverse (SB-Metaverse) and we focus on the technologies that support the operation of SB-Metaverse. In addition, we also present the applications of SB-Metaverse. Finally, we discuss several challenges faced by SB-Metaverse which must be addressed in the future. |

To collect relevant insights into systems' behavior, we observe many evaluation frameworks focusing mainly on the system under test throughput. However, these frameworks often need more comprehensiveness and generality, particularly in adopting a distributed applications' cross-layer approach. This work analyses in detail the requirements for distributed systems assessment. We summarize these findings into a structured methodology and experimentation framework called METHODA. Our approach emphasizes setting up and assessing a broader spectrum of distributed systems and addresses a notable research gap. We showcase the effectiveness of the framework by evaluating four distinct systems and their interaction, leveraging a diverse set of eight carefully selected metrics and 12 essential parameters. Through experimentation and analysis we demonstrate the framework's capabilities to provide valuable insights across various use cases. For instance, we identify that a combination of Trusted Execution Environments with threshold signature scheme FROST introduces minimal overhead on the performance with average latency around \SI{40}{\ms}. We showcase an emulation of realistic systems behavior, e.g., Maximal Extractable Value is possible and could be used to further model such dynamics. The METHODA framework enables a deeper understanding of distributed systems and is a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners navigating the complex landscape of modern computing infrastructures. |

However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures. |

However, achieving consensus among nodes and packaging blocks in blockchain networks is a complex task that requires efficient and secure consensus algorithms. The DPoS consensus algorithm has emerged as a popular choice due to its fast transaction processing and high throughput. Despite these advantages, the algorithm still suffers from weaknesses such as centralization and vulnerability to long-range attacks, which can compromise the integrity of the blockchain network.   To combat these problems, we developed an Enhanced Anti-Long-Range Attack DPoS algorithm (HL-DPoS). First, we split nodes into pieces to reduce centralization issues while giving witness nodes the power to report and benefit from malicious node's reports, maintaining high efficiency and high security. Second, we propose a validation method in HL-DPoS that compares consensuses transactions with the longest chain to detect long-range attacks. Algorithm analysis and simulation experiment results demonstrate that our HL-DPoS consensus algorithm improves security while achieving better consensus performance. |

However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized FL server. This article proposed a bi-level blockchained architecture for secure federated learning-based traffic prediction. The bottom and top layer blockchain store the local model and global aggregated parameters accordingly, and the distributed homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging (DHFA) scheme addresses the secure computation problems. We propose the partial private key distribution protocol and a partially homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme to achieve the distributed privacy-preserving federated averaging model. We conduct extensive experiments to measure the running time of DHFA operations, quantify the read and write performance of the blockchain network, and elucidate the impacts of varying regional group sizes and model complexities on the resulting prediction accuracy for the online traffic flow prediction task. The results indicate that the proposed system can facilitate secure and decentralized federated learning for real-world traffic prediction tasks. |

Kamkuemah et.al.|[2310.14600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14600)| Non-fungible tokens, NFT, have been used to record ownership of real estate, art, digital assets, and more recently to serve legal notice. They provide an important and accessible non-financial use of cryptocurrency's blockchain but are peculiar because ownership by NFT confers no rights over the asset. This work shows that it is possible to specify that peculiar property by combining functional and epistemic properties. Suitability of the specification is evaluated by proof that the blockchain implementation conforms to it, and by its use in an analysis of serving legal notice. |

Federated learning, which stores data in distributed nodes and shares only model parameters, has gained significant attention for addressing this concern. However, a challenge arises in federated learning due to the Byzantine Attack Problem, where malicious local models can compromise the global model's performance during aggregation. This article proposes the Blockchain-based Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning (BRLF) model that combines federated learning with blockchain technology. This integration enables traceability of malicious models and provides incentives for locally trained clients. Our approach involves selecting the aggregation node based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, and we perform spectral clustering and calculate the average gradient within each cluster, validating its accuracy using local dataset of the aggregation nodes. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superior byzantine robustness of our secure aggregation algorithm compared to other baseline byzantine robust aggregation methods, and proved our proposed model effectiveness in addressing the resource consumption problem. |

As the sentiment expressed on social media platforms can significantly influence cryptocurrency discussions and market movements, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and predicting market trends. Motivated by the aim to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy in the cryptocurrency domain, this paper investigates fine-tuning techniques on large language models. This paper also investigates the efficacy of supervised fine-tuning and instruction-based fine-tuning on large language models for unseen tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a significant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% after fine-tuning, highlighting the potential of this technique in optimizing pre-trained language model efficiency. Additionally, the impact of instruction tuning on models of varying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from instruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In contrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to the complete utilization of model capacity. To gain deeper insight about how instruction works with these language models, this paper presents an experimental investigation into the response of an instruction-based model under different instruction tuning setups. The investigation demonstrates that the model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple instructions. This performance significantly outperforms its accuracy under long and complex instructions by over 12%, thereby effectively highlighting the profound significance of instruction characteristics in maximizing model performance. |

Buoyed by the excitement around secure decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies, the last decade has witnessed numerous constructions of TLP variants and related applications (e.g., cost-efficient blockchain designs, randomness beacons, e-voting, etc.).   In this poster, we first extend the notion of TLP by formally defining the "time-lock public key encryption" (TLPKE) scheme. Next, we introduce and construct a "tight short-lived signatures" scheme using our TLPKE. Furthermore, to test the validity of our proposed schemes, we do a proof-of-concept implementation and run detailed simulations. |

This article proposes the conceptual model called PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two main components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data curation/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the private training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its applicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the existing model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we employed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or randomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively evaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of public database and resources, during each update when new information is added for training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy for private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain, private information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures such as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy vs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and obfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely, the use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational complexity and high training latency. We believe that the proposed model could be used as a benchmark for proposing privacy preserving LLMs for generative AI tools. |

In this paper, we introduce VDKMS (Vehicular Decentralized Key Management System), a novel Decentralized Key Management System designed specifically as an infrastructure for Cellular Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) networks, utilizing a blockchain-based approach. The proposed VDKMS addresses the challenges of secure communication, privacy preservation, and efficient key management in V2X scenarios. It integrates blockchain technology, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to enable secure and trustworthy V2X applications among vehicles, infrastructures, and networks. We first provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components, protocols, and workflows, covering aspects such as provisioning, registration, verification, and authorization. We then present a detailed performance evaluation, discussing the security properties and compatibility of the proposed solution, as well as a security analysis. Finally, we present potential applications in the vehicular ecosystem that can leverage the advantages of our approach. |

Despite the ubiquity of these graphs in real-world scenarios, it's usually impractical for us to obtain the whole real-time graphs due to privacy concerns and technical limitations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of {\it Live Graph Lab} for temporal graphs, which enables open, dynamic and real transaction graphs from blockchains. Among them, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most prominent parts of blockchain over the past several years. With more than \$40 billion market capitalization, this decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction activities, which naturally forms a complicated transaction network. However, there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its dynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of measurements are presented to understand the properties of the NFT ecosystem. Through comparisons with social, citation, and web networks, our analyses give intriguing findings and point out potential directions for future exploration. Finally, we also study machine learning models in this live graph to enrich the current datasets and provide new opportunities for the graph community.

This voluminous data stream requires a significant amount of network bandwidth and extensive storage infrastructure. Additionally, local data processing demands substantial manpower and hardware investments. Data isolation across different healthcare institutions hinders cross-institutional collaboration in clinics and research. In this work, we anticipate an innovative MRI system and its four generations that integrate emerging distributed cloud computing, 6G bandwidth, edge computing, federated learning, and blockchain technology. This system is called Cloud-MRI, aiming at solving the problems of MRI data storage security, transmission speed, AI algorithm maintenance, hardware upgrading, and collaborative work. The workflow commences with the transformation of k-space raw data into the standardized Imaging Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Raw Data (ISMRMRD) format. Then, the data are uploaded to the cloud or edge nodes for fast image reconstruction, neural network training, and automatic analysis. Then, the outcomes are seamlessly transmitted to clinics or research institutes for diagnosis and other services. The Cloud-MRI system will save the raw imaging data, reduce the risk of data loss, facilitate inter-institutional medical collaboration, and finally improve diagnostic accuracy and work efficiency. |

Existing protocols overlook diverse adversarial attacks, limiting transaction throughput. This paper presents Reticulum, a groundbreaking sharding protocol addressing this issue, boosting blockchain scalability.   Reticulum employs a two-phase approach, adapting transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks. It comprises "control" and "process" shards in two layers. Process shards contain at least one trustworthy node, while control shards have a majority of trusted nodes. In the first phase, transactions are written to blocks and voted on by nodes in process shards. Unanimously accepted blocks are confirmed. In the second phase, blocks without unanimous acceptance are voted on by control shards. Blocks are accepted if the majority votes in favor, eliminating first-phase opponents and silent voters. Reticulum uses unanimous voting in the first phase, involving fewer nodes, enabling more parallel process shards. Control shards finalize decisions and resolve disputes.   Experiments confirm Reticulum's innovative design, providing high transaction throughput and robustness against various network attacks, outperforming existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks. |

This shift is characterized by the need to accommodate dynamic participation, contrasting the traditional approach of a static set of continuously online participants. Works like Bitcoin and the sleepy model have set the stage for this evolving framework.   Notable contributions from Momose and Ren (CCS 2022) and subsequent works have introduced Total-Order Broadcast protocols leveraging Graded Agreement primitives and supporting dynamic participation. However, these approaches often require multiple phases of voting per decision, creating a potential bottleneck for real-world large-scale systems.   Addressing this, our paper introduces TOB-SVD, a novel Total-Order Broadcast protocol in the sleepy model, which is resilient to up to 1/2 of adversarial participants. TOB-SVD requires only a single phase of voting per decision in the best case and achieves lower expected latency compared to existing approaches offering the same optimal adversarial resilience. This work paves the way to more practical Total-Order Broadcast protocols to be implemented in real-world systems where a large number of participants are involved simultaneously and their participation level might fluctuate over time. |

It presents a comprehensive risk management framework developed in collaboration with financial institutions, blockchain development teams and regulators that applies a traditional risk management taxonomy to address certain overlooked blockchain protocol risks. The approach offers a structured way to identify, measure, monitor and report blockchain protocol risks. The paper provides real-world use cases to demonstrate the practicality and implementation of the proposed framework. The findings of this work contribute to the evolving understanding of blockchain protocol risks and provide valuable insights on how these risks affect the adoption of DLT by financial institutions. |

To overcome this limitation, many blockchains employ relayers, external applications capable of transporting data between different blockchains. Typically, the process of relaying data is permissionless and multiple independent relayers work concurrently to transport the same information between two blockchains. While this model increases the reliability of data delivery by providing redundancy, it also introduces challenges that have not been previously discussed. In this work, we bridge this gap by discussing the shortcomings of permissionless cross-chain relaying systems and identifying three issues that adversely impact their performance, scalability and security. We take the first step towards addressing issues that hinder performance and scalability by proposing a novel protocol to enable coordination among independent relayers. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion about the trade-offs associated with the design of relayer coordination protocols for permissionless settings. Through this work we provide a foundation for improving cross-chain relaying services. |

With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the Blockchain-empowered Heterogeneous Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel light-weight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We also dive into the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with Non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. The experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm. |

Jalalzai et.al.|[2310.09663](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09663)| Low latency is one of the most desirable features of partially synchronous Byzantine consensus protocols. Existing low-latency protocols have achieved consensus with just two communication steps by reducing the maximum number of faults the protocol can tolerate (from $f = \frac{n-1}{3}$ to $f = \frac{n+1}{5}$), \textcolor{black}{by relaxing protocol safety guarantees}, or by using trusted hardware like Trusted Execution Environment. Furthermore, these two-step protocols don't support rotating leaders and low-cost view change (leader replacement), which are important features of many blockchain use cases. In this paper, we propose a protocol called VBFT which achieves consensus in just two communication steps without sacrificing desirable features. In particular, VBFT tolerates $f = \frac{n-1}{3}$ faults (which is the best possible), guarantees strong safety for honest leaders, and requires no trusted hardware. Moreover, VBFT supports leader rotation and low-cost view change, thereby improving prior art on multiple axes. |

This paper focuses on protecting the lowest level layer in the blockchain, particularly the P2P network that allows the nodes to communicate and share information. The P2P network layer may be vulnerable to several families of attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), eclipse attacks, or Sybil attacks. This layer is prone to threats inherited from traditional P2P networks, and it must be analyzed and understood by collecting data and extracting insights from the network behavior to reduce those risks. We introduce Tikuna, an open-source tool for monitoring and detecting potential attacks on the Ethereum blockchain P2P network, at an early stage. Tikuna employs an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect attacks and alert users. Empirical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves detection performance, with the ability to detect and classify attacks, including eclipse attacks, Covert Flash attacks, and others that target the Ethereum blockchain P2P network layer, with high accuracy. Our research findings demonstrate that Tikuna is a valuable security tool for assisting operators to efficiently monitor and safeguard the status of Ethereum validators and the wider P2P network |

Wen et.al.|[2310.09143](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09143)| In the era of digital markets, the challenge for consumers is discerning quality amidst information asymmetry. While traditional markets use brand mechanisms to address this issue, transferring such systems to internet-based P2P markets, where misleading practices like fake ratings are rampant, remains challenging. Current internet platforms strive to counter this through verification algorithms, but these efforts find themselves in a continuous tug-of-war with counterfeit actions.   Exploiting the transparency, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology, this paper introduces a robust reputation voting system grounded in it. Unlike existing blockchain-based reputation systems, our model harnesses an intrinsically economically incentivized approach to bolster agent integrity. We optimize this model to mirror real-world user behavior, preserving the reputation system's foundational sustainability. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, using both uniform and power-law distributions enabled by an innovative inverse transform method, we traverse a broad parameter landscape, replicating real-world complexity. The findings underscore the promise of a sustainable, transparent, and formidable reputation mechanism. Given its structure, our framework can potentially function as a universal, sustainable oracle for offchain-onchain bridging, aiding entities in perpetually cultivating their reputation. Future integration with technologies like Ring Signature and Zero Knowledge Proof could amplify the system's privacy facets, rendering it particularly influential in the ever-evolving digital domain. |

The idea is to recognize the authenticity of a copy or digital document issued by an institution in a foreign country and detect forgeries. Certificates, financial records, health records, official papers and others are often required to be attested from multiple entities in distinct locations. However, in this digital era where most applications happen online, and document copies are uploaded, the traditional signature and seal methods are obsolete. In a matter of minutes and with a simple photo editor, a certificate or document copy may be plagiarized or forged. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized approach to record and verify transactions without the need for huge infrastructure investment. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based nostrification system, where awarding institutions generate a digital certificate, store in a public but permissioned blockchain, where students and other stakeholders may verify. We present a thorough discussion and formal evaluation of the proposed system. |

For efficient P2P trading, a free market for trading needs to be established while ensuring the information reliability, security, and privacy. Blockchain has been used to provide this framework, but it consumes very high energy and is slow. Further, until now, no blockchain model has considered the role of conventional electric utility companies in P2P trading. In this paper, we have introduced a credit blockchain that reduces energy consumption by employing a new mechanism to update transactions and increases speed by providing interest free loans to buyers. This model also integrates the electric utility companies within the P2P trading framework, thereby increasing members trading options. We have also discussed the pricing strategies for trading. All the above assertions have been verified through simulations, demonstrating that this model will promote P2P trading by providing enhanced security, speed, and greater trading options. The proposed model will also help trade energy at prices beneficial for both sellers and buyers. |
|**2023-10-13**|**Liveness Checking of the HotStuff Protocol Family**|Jérémie Decouchant et.al.|[2310.09006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09006)| Byzantine consensus protocols aim at maintaining safety guarantees under any network synchrony model and at providing liveness in partially or fully synchronous networks. However, several Byzantine consensus protocols have been shown to violate liveness properties under certain scenarios. Existing testing methods for checking the liveness of consensus protocols check for time-bounded liveness violations, which generate a large number of false positives. In this work, for the first time, we check the liveness of Byzantine consensus protocols using the temperature and lasso detection methods, which require the definition of ad-hoc system state abstractions. We focus on the HotStuff protocol family that has been recently developed for blockchain consensus. In this family, the HotStuff protocol is both safe and live under the partial synchrony assumption, while the 2-Phase Hotstuff and Sync HotStuff protocols are known to violate liveness in subtle fault scenarios. We implemented our liveness checking methods on top of the Twins automated unit test generator to test the HotStuff protocol family. Our results indicate that our methods successfully detect all known liveness violations and produce fewer false positives than the traditional time-bounded liveness checks. |

This has been a long-overlooked gap, as existing studies have primarily focused on inter-committee (validator set) behaviors and activities, while neglecting the dynamic formation of committees, especially for individual stakeholders seeking reliable validators. Our study bridges this gap by diving into the delegation process (normal users delegate their small-value tokens to delegatees who later act as validators) before entering an actual consensus phase.   We propose a Bayesian model to quantify normal users' trust in delegatees, which we further incorporate into a game-theoretical model to simulate users' reactions against a set of critical factors identified through extensive research (including 10+ staking service provider as well as 30+ PoS blockchains). Our results reveal that users tend to choose their delegatees and utilize their tokens by carefully weighing the delegation cost, the behaviors of other users, and the reputation of delegatees, ultimately reaching a Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, the collective trend significantly increases the likelihood of token concentration on a small number of delegatees. |
|**2023-10-13**|**HybridChain: Fast, Accurate, and Secure Transaction Processing with Distributed Learning**|Amirhossein Taherpour et.al.|[2310.08839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08839)| In order to fully unlock the transformative power of distributed ledgers and blockchains, it is crucial to develop innovative consensus algorithms that can overcome the obstacles of security, scalability, and interoperability, which currently hinder their widespread adoption. This paper introduces HybridChain that combines the advantages of sharded blockchain and DAG distributed ledger, and a consensus algorithm that leverages decentralized learning. Our approach involves validators exchanging perceptions as votes to assess potential conflicts between transactions and the witness set, representing input transactions in the UTXO model. These perceptions collectively contribute to an intermediate belief regarding the validity of transactions. By integrating their beliefs with those of other validators, localized decisions are made to determine validity. Ultimately, a final consensus is achieved through a majority vote, ensuring precise and efficient validation of transactions. Our proposed approach is compared to the existing DAG-based scheme IOTA and the sharded blockchain Omniledger through extensive simulations. The results show that IOTA has high throughput and low latency but sacrifices accuracy and is vulnerable to orphanage attacks especially with low transaction rates. Omniledger achieves stable accuracy by increasing shards but has increased latency. In contrast, the proposed HybridChain exhibits fast, accurate, and secure transaction processing, and excellent scalability. |

In contrast to existing works for coded blockchains, especially blockchain-of-things, the proposed scheme is more realistic, practical, and secure while achieving high throughput. This is accomplished by: 1) modeling the variety of transactions using a reward model, based on which an optimization problem is solved to select transactions that are more accessible and cheaper computational-wise to be processed together; 2) a transaction-based and lightweight consensus algorithm that emphasizes on using the minimum possible number of miners for processing the transactions; and 3) employing the raptor codes with linear-time encoding and decoding which results in requiring lower storage to maintain the blockchain and having a higher throughput. We provide detailed analysis and simulation results on the proposed scheme and compare it with the state-of-the-art coded IoT blockchain schemes including Polyshard and LCB, to show the advantages of our proposed scheme in terms of security, storage, decentralization, and throughput. |
|**2024-03-25**|**The Implications of Decentralization in Blockchained Federated Learning: Evaluating the Impact of Model Staleness and Inconsistencies**|Francesc Wilhelmi et.al.|[2310.07471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07471)| Blockchain promises to enhance distributed machine learning (ML) approaches such as federated learning (FL) by providing further decentralization, security, immutability, and trust, which are key properties for enabling collaborative intelligence in next-generation applications. Nonetheless, the intrinsic decentralized operation of peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes leads to an uncharted setting for FL, whereby the concepts of FL round and global model become meaningless, as devices' synchronization is lost without the figure of a central orchestrating server. In this paper, we study the practical implications of outsourcing the orchestration of FL to a democratic setting such as in a blockchain. In particular, we focus on the effects that model staleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on the training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we evaluate the blockchained FL operation by applying two different ML models (ranging from low to high complexity) on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and focus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions. Our results show the high impact of model inconsistencies on the accuracy of the models (up to a ~35% decrease in prediction accuracy), which underscores the importance of properly designing blockchain systems based on the characteristics of the underlying FL application. |
|**2023-10-11**|**A Microgrid Trading Framework Based on PoC Consensus**|Lianghaojie Zhou et.al.|[2310.07165](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07165)| In the field of energy Internet, blockchain-based distributed energy trading mode is a promising way to replace the traditional centralized trading mode. However, the current power blockchain platform based on public chain has problems such as low consensus efficiency and waste of computing resources. The energy trading platform based on the consortium chain has problems such as inability to attract users to join and collusion between alliances. We propose a microgrid trading framework based on proof of contribution (PoC). According to the contribution value, we randomly select nodes based on weights through verifiable random functions (VRF) in each round of consensus to form the next round of consensus committee. The proposed electricity trading framework not only improves the consensus efficiency of the blockchain, but also is suitable as an incentive mechanism to attract users to participate in the power blockchain. Experiments show that our framework is effective and the contribution value we designed is reasonable. Through our framework, we can motivate users to participate and make energy transactions more fair. |
|**2023-10-11**|**Decentralization of Energy Systems with Blockchain: Bridging Top-down and Bottom-up Management of the Electricity Grid**|Sakshi Mishra et.al.|[2310.07103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07103)| For more than a century, the grid has operated in a centralized top-down fashion. However, as distributed energy resources (DERs) penetration grows, the grid edge is increasingly infused with intelligent computing and communication capabilities. Thus, the bottom-up approach to grid operations inclined toward decentralizing energy systems will likely gain momentum alongside the existing centralized paradigm. Decentralization refers to transferring control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. It is not a new concept - in energy systems context or otherwise. In the energy systems context, however, the complexity of this multifaceted concept increases manifolds due to two major reasons - i) the nature of the commodity being traded (the electricity) and ii) the enormity of the traditional electricity sector's structure that builds, operates, and maintains this capital-intensive network. In this work, we aim to highlight the need for and outline a credible path toward restructuring the current operational architecture of the electricity grid in view of the ongoing decentralization trends with an emphasis on peer-to-peer energy trading. We further introduce blockchain technology in the context of decentralized energy systems problems. We also suggest that blockchain is an effective technology for facilitating the synergistic operations of top-down and bottom-up approaches to grid management. |
|**2024-03-11**|**Secure Decentralized Learning with Blockchain**|Xiaoxue Zhang et.al.|[2310.07079](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07079)| Federated Learning (FL) is a well-known paradigm of distributed machine learning on mobile and IoT devices, which preserves data privacy and optimizes communication efficiency. To avoid the single point of failure problem in FL, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed to use peer-to-peer communication for model aggregation, which has been considered an attractive solution for machine learning tasks on distributed personal devices. However, this process is vulnerable to attackers who share false models and data. If there exists a group of malicious clients, they might harm the performance of the model by carrying out a poisoning attack. In addition, in DFL, clients often lack the incentives to contribute their computing powers to do model training. In this paper, we proposed Blockchain-based Decentralized Federated Learning (BDFL), which leverages a blockchain for decentralized model verification and auditing. BDFL includes an auditor committee for model verification, an incentive mechanism to encourage the participation of clients, a reputation model to evaluate the trustworthiness of clients, and a protocol suite for dynamic network updates. Evaluation results show that, with the reputation mechanism, BDFL achieves fast model convergence and high accuracy on real datasets even if there exist 30\% malicious clients in the system. |

It is well known that no blockchain protocol can provide both to sleepy (intermittently online) clients under adversarial majority. However, safety is more critical in that a single safety violation can cause users to lose money. At the same time, liveness must not be lost forever. We show that, in a synchronous network, it is possible to maintain safety for all clients even during adversarial majority, and recover liveness after honest majority is restored. Our solution takes the form of a recovery gadget that can be applied to any protocol with certificates (such as HotStuff, Streamlet, Tendermint, and their variants). |
|**2024-05-24**|**BBCA-CHAIN: Low Latency, High Throughput BFT Consensus on a DAG**|Dahlia Malkhi et.al.|[2310.06335](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06335)| This paper presents a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol powered by BBCA, a lightly modified Byzantine Consistent Broadcast (BCB) primitive. BBCA provides a Complete-Adopt semantic through an added probing interface to allow either aborting the broadcast by correct nodes or exclusively, adopting the message consistently in case of a potential delivery. It does not introduce any extra types of messages or additional communication costs to BCB.   BBCA is harnessed into BBCA-CHAIN to make direct commits on a chained backbone of a causally ordered graph of blocks, without any additional voting blocks or artificial layering. With the help of Complete-Adopt, the additional knowledge gained from the underlying BCB completely removes the voting latency in popular DAG-based protocols. At the same time, causal ordering allows nodes to propose blocks in parallel and achieve high throughput. BBCA-CHAIN thus closes up the gap between protocols built by consistent broadcasts (e.g., Bullshark) to those without such an abstraction (e.g., PBFT/HotStuff), emphasizing their shared fundamental principles.   Using a Bracha-style BCB as an example, we fully specify BBCA-CHAIN with simplicity, serving as a solid basis for high-performance replication systems (and blockchains). |

Among them, the AI language model represented by ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve people in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in consulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee the authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are also hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover, the content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is difficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security issues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and affect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain technology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI. This paper mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain for LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process, and identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this paper also reviews the potential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier communication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic spectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined and the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early realization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community. |

With the increasing number of global and Turkish investors, it is evident that interest in digital assets will continue to rise sustainably, even in the face of financial fluctuations. However, it remains uncertain whether consumers perceive blockchain technology's ease of use and usefulness when purchasing cryptocurrencies. This study aims to explain blockchain technology's perceived ease of use and usefulness in cryptocurrency purchases by considering factors such as quality customer service, reduced costs, efficiency, and reliability. To achieve this goal, data were obtained from 463 participants interested in cryptocurrencies in different regions of Turkey. The data were analyzed using SPSS Process Macro programs. The analysis results indicate that perceived ease of use and usefulness mediate the effects of customer service and reduced costs, efficiency, and security on purchase intention. |

Once data owners share their data with others, though, it is no longer possible for them to control how their data are used. To address this issue, we propose a usage control architecture to monitor compliance with usage control policies. To this end, our solution relies on blockchain and trusted execution environments. We demonstrate the potential of the architecture by describing the various workflows needed to realize a motivating use case scenario for data markets. Additionally, we discuss the merits of the approach from privacy, security, integrateability, and affordability perspectives. |

FL effectively integrates cloud infrastructure to transfer ML models onto edge servers using blockchain technology. Through this mechanism, it guarantees the streamlined processing and data storage requirements of both centralized and decentralized systems, with an emphasis on scalability, privacy considerations, and cost-effective communication. In current FL implementations, data owners locally train their models, and subsequently upload the outcomes in the form of weights, gradients, and parameters to the cloud for overall model aggregation. This innovation obviates the necessity of engaging Internet of Things (IoT) clients and participants to communicate raw and potentially confidential data directly with a cloud center. This not only reduces the costs associated with communication networks but also enhances the protection of private data. This survey conducts an analysis and comparison of recent FL applications, aiming to assess their efficiency, accuracy, and privacy protection. However, in light of the complex and evolving nature of FL, it becomes evident that additional research is imperative to address lingering knowledge gaps and effectively confront the forthcoming challenges in this field. In this study, we categorize recent literature into the following clusters: privacy protection, resource allocation, case study analysis, and applications. Furthermore, at the end of each section, we tabulate the open areas and future directions presented in the referenced literature, affording researchers and scholars an insightful view of the evolution of the field. |

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided disaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief networks by swiftly assessing affected areas and timely delivering lifesaving supplies. To meet the growing demands for collaborative, trust-free, and transparent UDRN services, blockchain-based UDRNs emerge as a promising approach through immutable ledgers and distributed smart contracts. However, several efficiency and security challenges hinder the deployment of blockchain-based UDRNs, including the lack of cooperation between smart contracts, lack of dynamic audit for smart contract vulnerabilities, and low forensics robustness against transaction malleability attacks. Towards efficient and secure blockchain-based UDRNs, this paper presents potential solutions: (i) a series of collaborative smart contracts for coordinated relief management, (ii) a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown contract vulnerabilities; and (iii) a robust transaction forensics strategy with on/off-chain cooperation to resist transaction malleability attacks. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we outline key open research issues crucial to advancing this emerging field. |

With the advent of blockchain technologies and the proliferation of web3 paradigms of decentralised applications, smart contracts have been very instrumental in enabling developers to build applications that reside on decentralised blockchains. Despite the huge interest and potential of smart contracts, there is still a significant knowledge and skill gap that developers need to cross in order to build web3 applications. In light of this, we introduce MazzumaGPT, a large language model that has been optimised to generate smart contract code and aid developers to scaffold development and improve productivity. As part of this research, we outline the optimisation and fine-tuning parameters, evaluate the model's performance on functional correctness and address the limitations and broader impacts of our research. |

How to analyse the utility of opinion leaders' influence in realizing assets on the blockchain and adopt a compliant regulatory scheme is worth exploring and pondering. Taking Musk's call on social media to buy Dogecoin as an example, this paper uses an event study to empirically investigate the phenomenon in which opinion leaders use ICOs (initial coin offerings) to exert influence. The results show that opinion leaders can use ICOs to influence the price of token assets with money and data traffic in their social network. They can obtain excess returns and reduce the cost of realization so that the closed loop of influence realization will be accelerated. Based on this phenomenon and the results of its impact, we use the ChainLink Oracle with Active Sensor Networks(CO-ASnet) to design a safe and applicable decentralized regulatory scheme that can constructively provide risk assessment strategies and early warning measures for token issuance. The influence realization of opinion leaders in blockchain issuance is bound to receive widespread attention, and this paper will provide an exemplary reference for regulators and enterprises to explore the boundaries of blockchain financial product development and governance. |

This paper considers the deployment of Metaverse service in a cloud-edge resource architecture, which can satisfy the escalating demand for Metaverse service resources while ensuring both high bandwidth and low latency. We propose a novel mechanism, named Reliable and Secure Metaverse Service (RSMS), to ensure Metaverse service reliability and security without sacrificing performance. RSMS consists of two protocols: (1) One is a blockchain-based lightweight mutual authentication protocol concerning heterogeneous Metaverse service resource nodes (RNs) dynamically joining a Metaverse service resource pool while guaranteeing their trustworthiness, which guarantees the security of Metaverse service. (2) The other is a group authentication protocol used to form and maintain a stable and secure Metaverse service group composed by RNs, which ensures the reliability and enhances the security of Metaverse service. The reliability and security of Metaverse service under RSMS are thoroughly discussed, and informal and formal security analysis are conducted. Additionally, we study the impact of RSMS on Metaverse service throughput, demonstrating its lightweight feature. |

As the industrial IoT landscape expands, the establishment of secure and reliable infrastructure becomes crucial to instil trust among users and stakeholders, particularly in addressing fundamental concerns such as traceability, integrity protection, and privacy that some industries still encounter today. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving method in the industry's IoT systems using blockchain-based data access control for remote industry safety monitoring and maintaining event information confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. |

To address the problem that the blockchain cannot actively obtain off-chain data, the blockchain oracle is proposed as a bridge between the blockchain and external data. However, the existing oracle schemes are difficult to solve the problem of low quality of service caused by frequent data changes and heterogeneous devices in IIoT, and the current oracle node selection schemes are difficult to balance security and quality of service. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a secure and reliable oracle scheme that can obtain high-quality off-chain data. Specifically, we first design an oracle node selection algorithm based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation mechanism to securely select high-quality nodes. Second, we propose a data filtering algorithm based on a sliding window to further improve the consistency of the collected data. We verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the service quality of the oracle. |

In addition, the study identifies potential attack vectors that compromise these services. The paper explores the dual nature of mixing services, while they contribute to the preservation of privacy, a cornerstone of blockchain technologies, they can also facilitate illicit activities.

However, they currently rely on a centralized sequencer to determine transaction ordering, compromising the decentralization principle of blockchain systems. Recognizing this, there is a clear need for decentralized sequencers in rollups. However, designing such a system is intricate. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of decentralized sequencers in rollups, formulating their ideal properties, dissecting their core components, and synthesizing community insights. Our findings emphasize the imperative for an adept sequencer design, harmonizing with the overarching goals of the blockchain ecosystem, and setting a trajectory for subsequent research endeavors. |
|**2023-10-06**|**Dissecting Smart Contract Languages: A Survey**|Majd Soud et.al.|[2310.02799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02799)| Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that gained popularity for enabling the transformation of cryptocurrency among peers without mediation by a centralized third-party authority. Smart contracts expand the applications of blockchain technology and have played a role in its widespread adoption. Smart contracts are immutable digital programs that are deployed on blockchains to codify agreements between parties. Existing smart contract implementations have faced challenges, including security vulnerabilities, leading to significant losses and concerns. This has stimulated a wave of attempts to improve Smart Contract Languages (SCLs) to overcome implementation challenges and ensure code quality, producing many languages with diverse features. Scholars have made some attempts to classify SCLs and clarify the process of selecting an SCL, but to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive survey of existing SCLs has been published. Our work surpasses earlier efforts by evaluating a significantly larger set of SCLs, in greater depth, to ease the process of SCL selection for blockchain research and implementation. In this paper, we (1) propose a robust framework for comparing existing SCLs, (2) analyze and discuss 36 SCLs, addressing issues beyond those used to construct the comparison framework, and (3) define new parameters for future research and development of SCLs. The survey provides a guide for those who intend to select or use an SCL to implement smart contracts, develop new SCLs, or add new extensions to the existing SCLs. |
|**2024-05-10**|**zkFL: Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Gradient Aggregation for Federated Learning**|Zhipeng Wang et.al.|[2310.02554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02554)| Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed. |

Unlike existing tools, our toolchain combines the power of ANTLR4 and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) traversal techniques to transform the architecture and interactions within smart contracts into a specialized bipartite graph. This enables advanced network analytics to highlight operational efficiencies within the DApp's architecture.   The bipartite graph generated by the proposed tool comprises two sets of nodes: one representing smart contracts, interfaces, and libraries, and the other including functions, events, and modifiers. Edges in the graph connect functions to smart contracts they interact with, offering a granular view of interdependencies and execution flow within the DApp. This network-centric approach allows researchers and practitioners to apply complex network theory in understanding the robustness, adaptability, and intricacies of decentralized systems.   Our work contributes to the enhancement of security in smart contracts by allowing the visualisation of the network, and it provides a deep understanding of the architecture and operational logic within DApps. Given the growing importance of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem and the emerging application of complex network theory in technology, our toolchain offers a timely contribution to both academic research and practical applications in the field of blockchain technology. |

NFTs serve as the foundational framework that has revolutionized the market for digital art, enabling artists to showcase and monetize their creations in unprecedented ways. NFTs combine metadata stored on the blockchain with off-chain data, such as images, to create a novel form of digital ownership. It is not fully understood how these factors come together to determine NFT prices. In this study, we analyze both on-chain and off-chain data of NFT collections trading on OpenSea to understand what influences NFT pricing. Our results show that while text and image data of the NFTs can be used to explain price variations within collections, the extracted features do not generalize to new, unseen collections. Furthermore, we find that an NFT collection's trading volume often relates to its online presence, like social media followers and website traffic. |
|**2024-05-22**|**Data Transmissions in Blockchain enabled AGVs**|Junhan Liu et.al.|[2310.01594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01594)| Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) operate in synergy to execute specific tasks. These vehicles exchange information to ensure seamless collaboration, prevent collisions, and eliminate task redundancy. The advent of blockchain technology offers a promising avenue for establishing a secure and dependable communication infrastructure for AGVs. Nonetheless, it becomes imperative for AGVs to adopt efficient data transmission methodologies, especially when interacting with the dynamic nature of blockchain infrastructure where data undergoes frequent modifications.   In the present study, we introduce a novel data transmission methodology tailored for blockchain-integrated AGVs utilizing the principles of Named Data Networking (NDN). A simulated environment was crafted and executed in NetSim, wherein multiple AGVs collaboratively endeavored to locate concealed objectives within a defined region. Upon discovery of novel elements, such as obstructions or concealed objectives, each AGV would update a collective blockchain repository. This blockchain infrastructure leverages NDN to fetch specific data blocks in response to data queries from individual AGVs. This system ensures that AGVs can navigate and scrutinize their environment with heightened efficiency, drawing upon the collective intelligence and shared experiences of the fleet. |
|**2023-10-02**|**Decentralization Cheapens Corruptive Majority Attacks**|Stephen H. Newman et.al.|[2310.01546](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01546)| Corruptive majority attacks, in which mining power is distributed among miners and an attacker attempts to bribe a majority of miners into participation in a majority attack, pose a threat to blockchains. Budish bounded the cost of bribing miners to participate in an attack by their expected loss as a result of attack success. We show that this bound is loose. In particular, an attack may be structured so that under equilibrium play by most miners, a miner's choice to participate only slightly affects the attack success chance. Combined with the fact that most of the cost of attack success is externalized by any given small miner, this implies that if most mining power is controlled by small miners, bribing miners to participate in such an attack is much cheaper than the Budish bound. We provide a scheme for a cheap corruptive majority attack and discuss practical concerns and consequences. |

While many countries have adopted a national digital identity system, many are still in the process of establishing one. Through a comparative analysis of the technological and legal dimensions of a few selected national digital identity solutions currently being used in different countries, we highlight the diversity of technologies and architectures and the key role of the legal framework of a given digital identity solution. We also present several key issues related to the implementation of these solutions, how to ensure the State sovereignty over them, and how to strike the right balance between private sector and public sector needs. This position paper aims to help policy makers, software developers and concerned users understand the challenges of designing, implementing and using a national digital identity management system and establishing a legal framework for digital identity management, including personal data protection measures. The authors of this paper have a favorable position for self-sovereign identity management systems that are based on Blockchain technology, and we believe they are the most suitable for national digital identity systems. |

The ability of IoT appliances to provide pervasive and better support to everyday tasks, in most cases transparently to humans, is also achieved through the high degree of autonomy of such devices. However, the higher the number of new capabilities and services provided in an autonomous way, the wider the attack surface that exposes users to data hacking and lost. In this scenario, many critical challenges arise also because IoT devices have heterogeneous computational capabilities (i.e., in the same network there might be simple sensors/actuators as well as more complex and smart nodes). In this paper, we try to provide a contribution in this setting, tackling the non-trivial issues of equipping smart things with a strategy to evaluate, also through their neighbors, the trustworthiness of an object in the network before interacting with it. To do so, we design a novel and fully distributed trust model exploiting devices' behavioral fingerprints, a distributed consensus mechanism and the Blockchain technology. Beyond the detailed description of our framework, we also illustrate the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance. |
|**2023-10-02**|**A Decentralized Cooperative Navigation Approach for Visual Homing Networks**|Mohamed Rahouti et.al.|[2310.00906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00906)| Visual homing is a lightweight approach to visual navigation. Given the stored information of an initial 'home' location, the navigation task back to this location is achieved from any other location by comparing the stored home information to the current image and extracting a motion vector. A challenge that constrains the applicability of visual homing is that the home location must be within the robot's field of view to initiate the homing process. Thus, we propose a blockchain approach to visual navigation for a heterogeneous robot team over a wide area of visual navigation. Because it does not require map data structures, the approach is useful for robot platforms with a small computational footprint, and because it leverages current visual information, it supports a resilient and adaptive path selection. Further, we present a lightweight Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism for reaching consensus in the untrustworthy visual homing network. |

On the Ethereum platform, Ponzi schemes, phishing scams, and a variety of other frauds emerge. Existing Ponzi scheme detection approaches based on heterogeneous transaction graph modeling leverages semantic information between node (account) pairs to establish connections, overlooking the semantic attributes inherent to the edges (interactions). To overcome this, we construct heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs with multiple triplet interaction patterns to better depict the real Ethereum environment. Based on this, we design a new framework named multi-triplet augmented heterogeneous graph neural network (MAHGNN) for Ponzi scheme detection. We introduce the Conditional Variational Auto Encoder (CVAE) to capture the semantic information of different triplet interaction patterns, which facilitates the characterization on account features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAHGNN is capable of addressing the problem of multi-edge interactions in heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs and achieving state-of-the-art performance in Ponzi scheme detection. |
|**2023-09-30**|**A Distributed Efficient Blockchain Oracle Scheme for Internet of Things**|Youquan Xian et.al.|[2310.00254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00254)| In recent years, blockchain has been widely applied in the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain oracle, as a bridge for data communication between blockchain and off-chain, has also received significant attention. However, the numerous and heterogeneous devices in the IoT pose great challenges to the efficiency and security of data acquisition for oracles. We find that the matching relationship between data sources and oracle nodes greatly affects the efficiency and service quality of the entire oracle system. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed and efficient oracle solution tailored for the IoT, enabling fast acquisition of real-time off-chain data. Specifically, we first design a distributed oracle architecture that combines both Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) devices and ordinary devices to improve system scalability, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Secondly, based on the trusted node information provided by TEE, we determine the matching relationship between nodes and data sources, assigning appropriate nodes for tasks to enhance system efficiency. Through simulation experiments, our proposed solution has been shown to effectively improve the efficiency and service quality of the system, reducing the average response time by approximately 9.92\% compared to conventional approaches. |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have pioneered anomaly detection in such platforms, capturing the intricacies of both spatial and temporal transactional patterns has remained a challenge. This study presents a fusion of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Temporal Random Walks (TRW) enhanced by probabilistic sampling to bridge this gap. Our approach, unlike traditional GCNs, leverages the strengths of TRW to discern complex temporal sequences in Ethereum transactions, thereby providing a more nuanced transaction anomaly detection mechanism. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that our TRW-GCN framework substantially advances the performance metrics over conventional GCNs in detecting anomalies and transaction bursts. This research not only underscores the potential of temporal cues in Ethereum transactional data but also offers a scalable and effective methodology for ensuring the security and transparency of decentralized platforms. By harnessing both spatial relationships and time-based transactional sequences as node features, our model introduces an additional layer of granularity, making the detection process more robust and less prone to false positives. This work lays the foundation for future research aimed at optimizing and enhancing the transparency of blockchain technologies, and serves as a testament to the significance of considering both time and space dimensions in the ever-evolving landscape of the decentralized platforms. |

It emphasizes the inherent vulnerabilities embedded in the programming languages commonly employed for smart contract development, particularly within Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains. While the concrete example used primarily employs the Solidity programming language, the insights garnered from this study are readily generalizable to a wide array of blockchain architectures. Significantly, this article extends beyond the mere identification of vulnerabilities and ventures into the realm of proactive security measures. It explores the adaptation and adoption of dataflow programming paradigms, employing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to enforce security by design in the context of smart contract development. This forward-looking approach aims to bolster the foundational principles of blockchain security, offering a promising research direction for mitigating the risks associated with smart contract vulnerabilities. The objective of this article is to cater to a diverse audience, ranging from individuals with limited computer science and programming expertise to seasoned experts in the field. It provides a comprehensive and accessible resource for fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics between blockchain technology and the imperative need for secure smart contract development practices. |

Ballandies et.al.|[2309.16707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16707)| As digitalization and technological advancements continue to shape the infrastructure landscape, the emergence of blockchain-based decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) has gained prominence. However, a systematic categorization of DePIN components and their interrelationships is still missing. To address this gap, we conduct a literature review and analysis of existing frameworks and derived a taxonomy of DePIN systems from a conceptual architecture. Our taxonomy encompasses three key dimensions: distributed ledger technology, cryptoeconomic design and physicial infrastructure network. Within each dimension, we identify and define relevant components and attributes, establishing a clear hierarchical structure. Moreover, we illustrate the relationships and dependencies among the identified components, highlighting the interplay between governance models, hardware architectures, networking protocols, token mechanisms, and distributed ledger technologies. This taxonomy provides a foundation for understanding and classifying diverse DePIN networks, serving as a basis for future research and facilitating knowledge exchange, fostering collaboration and standardization within the emerging field of decentralized physical infrastructure networks. |

Missing these dimensions in healthcare information systems is a point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably perpetuate existing biases, produce far from optimal results, and may generate diagnosis errors. An often-overlooked community with distinct care values and needs are LGBT+ older adults, which has traditionally been under-surveyed in healthcare and technology design. This paper investigates the implications of missing gender and sex considerations in distributed ledger technologies for LGBT+ older adults. By using the value sensitive design methodology, our contribution shows that many value meanings dear to marginalized communities are not considered in the design of the blockchain, such as LGBT+ older adults' interpretations of trust, privacy, and security. By highlighting the LGBT+ older population values, our contribution alerts us to the potential discriminatory implications of these technologies, which do not consider the gender and sex differences of marginalized, silent populations. Focusing on one community throughout - LGBT+ older adults - we emphasize the need for a holistic, value sensitive design approach for the development of ledger technologies for healthcare, including the values of everyone within the healthcare ecosystem. |

A key enabler for adoption of blockchain-based federated learning is how to select suitable participants to train models collaboratively. Selecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on blockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is helpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying multi-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in each block, making the query time-consuming. An efficient query method for multi-dimensional metadata in the blockchain for selecting participants in FL is absent and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data structure to improve the query efficiency within each block named MerkleRB-Tree. In detail, we leverage Minimal Bounding Rectangle(MBR) and bloom-filters for the query process of multi-dimensional continuous-valued attributes and discrete-valued attributes respectively. Furthermore, we migrate the idea of the skip list along with an MBR and a bloom filter at the head of each block to enhance the query efficiency for inter-blocks. The performance analysis and extensive evaluation results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method in blockchain-based FL. |

If the attacker's chain has the most cumulative mining puzzle difficulty, nodes will recognize it as canonical. We propose a modification to PoW protocols, called ADESS, that contains two novel features. The first modification enables a node to identify the attacker chain by comparing the temporal sequence of blocks on competing chains. The second modification penalizes the attacker by requiring it to apply exponentially increasing hashrate in order to make its chain canonical. We demonstrate two things; (i) the expected cost of carrying out a double-spend attack is weakly higher under ADESS compared to the current PoW protocols and (ii) for any value of transaction, there is a penalty setting in ADESS that renders the expected profit of a double-spend attack negative. |

|**2023-09-25**|**Towards a Theory of Maximal Extractable Value II: Uncertainty**|Tarun Chitra et.al.|[2309.14201](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14201)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is value extractable by temporary monopoly power commonly found in decentralized systems. This extraction stems from a lack of user privacy upon transaction submission and the ability of a monopolist validator to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. There are two main directions to reduce MEV: reduce the flexibility of the miner to reorder transactions by enforcing ordering rules and/or introduce a competitive market for the right to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. In this work, we unify these approaches via \emph{uncertainty principles}, akin to those found in harmonic analysis and physics. This provides a quantitative trade-off between the freedom to reorder transactions and the complexity of an economic payoff to a user in a decentralized network. This trade off is analogous to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and demonstrates that sequencing rules in blockchains need to be application specific. Our results suggest that neither so-called fair ordering techniques nor economic mechanisms can individually mitigate MEV for arbitrary payoff functions. |

Alkhodair et.al.|[2309.13498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13498)| The most essential component of every Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the Consensus Algorithm (CA), which enables users to reach a consensus in a decentralized and distributed manner. Numerous CA exist, but their viability for particular applications varies, making their trade-offs a crucial factor to consider when implementing DLT in a specific field. This article provided a comprehensive analysis of the various consensus algorithms used in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and blockchain networks. We cover an extensive array of thirty consensus algorithms. Eleven attributes including hardware requirements, pre-trust level, tolerance level, and more, were used to generate a series of comparison tables evaluating these consensus algorithms. In addition, we discuss DLT classifications, the categories of certain consensus algorithms, and provide examples of authentication-focused and data-storage-focused DLTs. In addition, we analyze the pros and cons of particular consensus algorithms, such as Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS), Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS), and Avalanche. In conclusion, we discuss the applicability of these consensus algorithms to various Cyber Physical System (CPS) use cases, including supply chain management, intelligent transportation systems, and smart healthcare. |

With its wide adoption, it operates as a highly critical public ledger. On its transition to become more scalable and sustainable, shifting to PoS without sacrificing the security and resilience of PoW, Ethereum offers a range of consensus clients to participate in the network. In this paper, we present a methodology to measure the performance of the consensus clients based on the latency to receive messages from the p2p network. The paper includes a study that identifies the incentives and limitations that the network experiences, presenting insights about the latency impact derived from running the software in different locations. |

Grassroots cryptocurrencies turn mutual trust into liquidity and thus could be a powerful means for 'banking the unbanked'. Grassroots cryptocurrencies have not been provided yet with a payment system, which is the goal of this paper. Here, we present Grassroots Flash, a payment system for grassroots cryptocurrencies that employs the blocklace -- a DAG-like counterpart of the blockchain data structure. We analyze its security (safety, liveness, and privacy) and efficiency, prove that it is indeed grassroots. |
|**2023-09-22**|**Optimal Dynamic Fees for Blockchain Resources**|Davide Crapis et.al.|[2309.12735](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12735)| We develop a general and practical framework to address the problem of the optimal design of dynamic fee mechanisms for multiple blockchain resources. Our framework allows to compute policies that optimally trade-off between adjusting resource prices to handle persistent demand shifts versus being robust to local noise in the observed block demand. In the general case with more than one resource, our optimal policies correctly handle cross-effects (complementarity and substitutability) in resource demands. We also show how these cross-effects can be used to inform resource design, i.e. combining resources into bundles that have low demand-side cross-effects can yield simpler and more efficient price-update rules. Our framework is also practical, we demonstrate how it can be used to refine or inform the design of heuristic fee update rules such as EIP-1559 or EIP-4844 with two case studies. We then estimate a uni-dimensional version of our model using real market data from the Ethereum blockchain and empirically compare the performance of our optimal policies to EIP-1559. |

The key insight of Cuttlefish is that consensus in blockchains is necessary due to contention, rather than multiple owners of an asset as suggested by prior work. Previous proposals proactively use consensus to prevent contention from blocking assets, taking a pessimistic approach. In contrast, Cuttlefish introduces collective objects and multi-owner transactions that can offer most of the functionality of classic blockchains when objects transacted on are not under contention. Additionally, in case of contention, Cuttlefish proposes a novel `Unlock' protocol that significantly reduces the latency of unblocking contented objects. By leveraging these features, Cuttlefish implements consensus-less protocols for a broader range of transactions, including asset swaps and multi-signature transactions, which were previously believed to require consensus. |

The Sui blockchain protocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower latency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when candidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by Carousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike Carousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in mind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly provided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might commit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our implementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless setting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase when suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults). |

However, the capacity of miners to strategically order transactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks, sandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for their own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes recently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of transactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price. Utilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct sandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.   However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free profits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal strategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility of miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results unveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally strategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of trading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter represents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.   Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon: Miner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without trading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm, all users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent or surpass profits compared to their expectations. This outcome provides further support for the study and design of sequencing rules in decentralized exchanges. |

This study investigates the trade-offs between GPS utility and privacy among drivers, using a mixed-method approach that includes a survey of 151 participants and 10 follow-up interviews. We examine usage patterns, feature preferences, and comfort levels with location tracking and destination prediction. Our findings demonstrate that users tend to overlook potential privacy risks in favor of the utility the technology provides. We also find that users do not mind sharing inaccurate or obfuscated location data as long as their frequently visited locations aren't identified, and their full driving routes can't be recreated. Based on our findings, we explore design opportunities for enhancing privacy and utility, including adaptive interfaces, personalized profiles, and technological innovations like blockchain. |

Medical data security seems critical aspect due to sensitivity of patient information. Unauthorized access of medical data creates major issue to patients. This article proposed block chain with hybrid encryption technique for securing medical data stored in block chain model at cloud storage. New Two fish encryption model is implemented based on RSA Multiple Precision Arithmetic. MPA works by using library concept. The objective of using this methodology is to enhance security performance with less execution time. Patient data is processed by encryption algorithm and stored at blockchain infrastructure using encrypted key. Access permission allows user to read or write the medical data attached in block chain framework. The performance of traditional cryptographic techniques is very less in providing security infrastructure. |

|**2023-09-20**|**Lazy Contracts: Alleviating High Gas Costs by Secure and Trustless Off-chain Execution of Smart Contracts**|Soroush Farokhnia et.al.|[2309.11317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11317)| Smart contracts are programs that are executed on the blockchain and can hold, manage and transfer assets in the form of cryptocurrencies. The contract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus, i.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls and keep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such as Ethereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by malicious parties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavy computations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of a function call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps prevent DoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022, on Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3 Billion USD. This thesis proposes "lazy contracts" as a solution to alleviate these costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuring that each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, while preserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about the state of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chain execution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to the contract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can only happen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol can identify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for the entire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly. Finally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Solidity contracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January 2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by 55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees. |
|**2023-09-20**|**A Game-theoretic Approach for Provably-Uniform Random Number Generation in Decentralized Networks**|Zhuo Cai et.al.|[2309.11250](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11250)| Many protocols in distributed computing rely on a source of randomness, usually called a random beacon, both for their applicability and security. This is especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the next miner or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihood to be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.   Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroboros and Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely on pseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform, which is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate their randomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants are required to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of a final random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that the numbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentive for the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beacons have both limitations.   In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation of randomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar to some of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by different participants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial difference is that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone's best interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is the first to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, the approach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers. It is also tamper-proof and no party can change the output or affect its distribution. Finally, it is designed with modularity in mind and can be easily plugged into existing distributed protocols such as proof-of-stake blockchains. |

However, the responsible authorities may be incentivized to ignore certain reports, e.g., when addressing them inflicts high costs. In this work, we explore the applicability of blockchain technology to hold authorities accountable regarding filed reports. Our initial assessment indicates that our approach can be extended to benefit citizens and authorities in the future. |

The permissionless nature of the blockchains where these smart contracts are executed makes DeFi services exposed to security risks, since adversaries can target any of the underlying contracts to economically damage the compound service. We introduce a new notion of secure composability of smart contracts, which ensures that adversaries cannot economically harm the compound contract by interfering with its dependencies. |
|**2023-10-06**|**Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding**|André Storhaug et.al.|[2309.09826](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09826)| Auto-completing code enables developers to speed up coding significantly. Recent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies have been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such synthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable code generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable lines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when generating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we deny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To evaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC security. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397 Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning took more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned model could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were vulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing different types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that more than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further fine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of vulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning took only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and found that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as vulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could efficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code. |
|**2023-09-18**|**New Bounds on the Accuracy of Majority Voting for Multi-Class Classification**|Sina Aeeneh et.al.|[2309.09564](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09564)| Majority voting is a simple mathematical function that returns the value that appears most often in a set. As a popular decision fusion technique, the majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where a number of independent voters report their opinions on a classification problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble learning, data crowd-sourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multi-class classification problem has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive a new upper bound on the accuracy of the MVF for the multi-class classification problem. More specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF exponentially decays toward zero as the number of independent voters increases. Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of independent voters if these conditions are not met.   We first explore the problem for independent and identically distributed voters where we assume that every voter follows the same conditional probability distribution of voting for different classes, given the true classification of the data point. Next, we extend our results for the case where the voters are independent but non-identically distributed. Using the derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate only when the MVF achieves a small error rate, and vice versa, achieve a large error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. In the worst-case scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may achieve a higher error rate than the MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical simulations. |

Although many existing works on the overall system performance of Hyperledger Fabric are available, a decomposition of each phase in Hyperledger Fabric remains to be explored. Admittedly, the overall system performance of Hyperledger Fabric might provide an end-user with satisfied performance information when invoking a transaction; however, it is far from informative when deploying a distributed system with specific performance goals, except for understanding each phase in Hyperledger Fabric. In this paper, we develop a measurement framework to characterize each phase's transaction and block data in Hyperledger Fabric based on the Fabric SDK Nodejs, where we thoroughly analyze and open source the implementation details of the measurement framework. We evaluate the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and have some interesting observations; 1. The number of CPU cores has a linear impact on the throughput of an endorsing peer. 2. The Raft-based ordering service shows good scalability with the number of ordering service nodes. 3. The communication latencies between the client and service in Hyperledger Fabric are significant. We then identify each phase's dominant latency in Hyperledger Fabric via primitive operation analysis and propose a stochastic computation model for performance analysis. We also use the alpha-beta communication model to analyze the corresponding communication latency. Finally, we validate the accuracy of the performance model on both local and cloud clusters. The experiment results and the performance model help guide the deployment of the Hyperledger Fabric service. |

In this paper, a novel consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Prospect-Theory (PoPT) is designed from the view of game theory, where the game prospect value is considered as an important election criterion of the block-recorder. PoPT portrays the popularity of a node in the network as an attribute, which is constituted by the subjective sensibilities of nodes. Furthermore, the performances of the PoPT and the willingness of ordinary nodes to participate in the consensus are analyzed, exploring fairness, decentralization, credibility, and the motivating ability of the consensus mechanism. Finally, numerical simulations with optimization of the PoPT consensus mechanism are demonstrated in the scenario of a smart grid system to illustrate the effectiveness of the PoPT. |

|**2023-09-14**|**Two Timin': Repairing Smart Contracts With A Two-Layered Approach**|Abhinav Jain et.al.|[2309.07841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07841)| Due to the modern relevance of blockchain technology, smart contracts present both substantial risks and benefits. Vulnerabilities within them can trigger a cascade of consequences, resulting in significant losses. Many current papers primarily focus on classifying smart contracts for malicious intent, often relying on limited contract characteristics, such as bytecode or opcode. This paper proposes a novel, two-layered framework: 1) classifying and 2) directly repairing malicious contracts. Slither's vulnerability report is combined with source code and passed through a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and Large Language Models (LLMs), classifying and repairing each suggested vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and prompt-engineered LLMs. The smart contract repair models, built from pre-trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and fine-tuned Llama-2-7B models, reduced the overall vulnerability count by 97.5% and 96.7% respectively. A manual inspection of repaired contracts shows that all retain functionality, indicating that the proposed method is appropriate for automatic batch classification and repair of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. |
|**2023-09-18**|**Almost sure one-endedness of a random graph model of distributed ledgers**|Jiewei Feng et.al.|[2309.07774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07774)| Blockchain and other decentralized databases, known as distributed ledgers, are designed to store information online where all trusted network members can update the data with transparency. The dynamics of ledger's development can be mathematically represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). One essential property of a properly functioning shared ledger is that all network members holding a copy of the ledger agree on a sequence of information added to the ledger, which is referred to as consensus and is known to be related to a structural property of DAG called one-endedness. In this paper, we consider a model of distributed ledger with sequential stochastic arrivals that mimic attachment rules from the IOTA cryptocurrency. We first prove that the number of leaves in the random DAG is bounded by a constant infinitely often through the identification of a suitable martingale, and then prove that a sequence of specific events happens infinitely often. Combining those results we establish that, as time goes to infinity, the IOTA DAG is almost surely one-ended. |
|**2024-05-14**|**On the Potential and Limitations of Proxy Voting: Delegation with Incomplete Votes**|Georgios Amanatidis et.al.|[2309.05642](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05642)| We study elections where voters are faced with the challenge of expressing preferences over an extreme number of issues under consideration. This is largely motivated by emerging blockchain governance systems, which include voters with different weights and a massive number of community generated proposals. In such scenarios, it is natural to expect that voters will have incomplete preferences, as they may only be able to evaluate or be confident about a very small proportion of the alternatives. As a result, the election outcome may be significantly affected, leading to suboptimal decisions. Our central inquiry revolves around whether delegation of ballots to proxies possessing greater expertise or a more comprehensive understanding of the voters' preferences can lead to outcomes with higher legitimacy and enhanced voters' satisfaction in elections where voters submit incomplete preferences. To explore its aspects, we introduce the following model: potential proxies advertise their ballots over multiple issues, and each voter either delegates to a seemingly attractive proxy or casts a ballot directly. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions that could lead to a socially better outcome by leveraging the participation of proxies. We accompany our theoretical findings with experiments on instances derived from real datasets. Overall, our results enhance the understanding of the power of delegation towards improving election outcomes. |

Despite their crucial role, the development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions, showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score is lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the remaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these tools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract vulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field needs to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions; and the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models, specifically ChatGPT, for the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities. |

However, dynamically available TOB protocols are synchronous protocols, and they lose their safety guarantees during periods of asynchrony. This is a major issue in practice.   In this paper, we propose a simple but effective mechanism for tolerating bounded periods of asynchrony in dynamically available TOB protocols that ensure safety deterministically. We propose to trade off assumptions limiting the online/offline churn rate in exchange for tolerating bounded asynchronous periods through the use of a configurable message-expiration period.   In practice, this allows picking a small synchrony bound $\delta$, and therefore obtain a fast protocol in the common case, knowing that the protocol tolerates occasional periods of duration at most $\pi>\delta$ during which the bound does not hold. We show how to apply this idea to a state-of-the-art protocol to make it tolerate bounded periods of asynchrony. |

Existing AFL approaches are commonly under the assumption of sellers' market in that the service clients as sellers are treated as scarce resources so that the aggregation servers as buyers need to compete the bids. Yet, as the technology progresses, an increasing number of qualified clients are now capable of performing federated learning tasks, leading to shift from sellers' market to a buyers' market. In this paper, we shift the angle by adapting the procurement auction framework, aiming to explain the pricing behavior under buyers' market. Our modeling starts with basic setting under complete information, then move further to the scenario where sellers' information are not fully observable. In order to select clients with high reliability and data quality, and to prevent from external attacks, we utilize a blockchain-based reputation mechanism. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. |

We achieve this goal by maximizing an entropy function subject to specific constraints. These constraints are based on some prior information, including the average numbers of transactions in the block and the transaction pool, respectively. Furthermore, we use some numerical experiments to analyze how the key factors in this approximate expression depend on the crucial parameters of the blockchain system. As a result, this approximate expression has important theoretical significance in promoting practical applications of blockchain technology. At the same time, not only do the method and results given in this paper provide a new line in the study of blockchain queueing systems, but they also provide the theoretical basis and technical support for how to apply the information theory to the investigation of blockchain queueing networks and stochastic models more broadly. |

However, the current oracle schemes face the dilemma of security and service quality in the process of node selection, and the implicit interest relationship in financial applications leads to a significant conflict of interest between the task publisher and the executor, which reduces the participation enthusiasm of both parties and system security. Therefore, this paper proposes an anonymous node selection scheme that anonymously selects nodes with high reputations to participate in tasks to ensure the security and service quality of nodes. Then, this paper also details the interest requirements and behavioral motives of all parties in the payment settlement and asset valuation scenarios. Under the hypothesis of rational man, an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game is proposed. It can achieve equilibrium under the pursuit of the revenue of task publishers and executors, thereby ensuring the revenue of all types of users and improving the enthusiasm for participation. Finally, we verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the variance of obtaining price data by about 55\% while ensuring security, and meeting the revenue of all parties. |

Originally designed to solve privacy issues, ZKPs have now evolved into an effective remedy for scalability concerns and are applied in Zcash (internet money like Bitcoin). To enable ZKPs, Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) offer a verifier for bi-linear equations. To accurately and efficiently represent R1CS, several language tools like Circom, Noir, and Snarky have been proposed to automate the compilation of advanced programs into R1CS. However, due to the flexible nature of R1CS representation, there can be significant differences in the compiled R1CS forms generated from circuit language programs with the same underlying semantics. To address this issue, this paper uses a data-flow-based R1CS paradigm algorithm, which produces a standardized format for different R1CS instances with identical semantics. By using the normalized R1CS format circuits, the complexity of circuits' verification can be reduced. In addition, this paper presents an R1CS normalization algorithm benchmark, and our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of our methods. |

Employing social networks and graphs, as powerful tools for modeling connections within groups or communities would provide valuable guidance for analyzing these properties. This study mainly focuses on creating and examining networks related to two major decentralized exchanges including Uniswap Version 2 (UniswapV2) and SushiSwap. We have discovered that the distribution of nodes' degrees follows a power law that makes them scale-free networks, in addition, the centrality of tokens in exchange graphs provides valuable insights into their price and significance in cryptocurrency markets. These measures of centrality can be used to detect anomalies in cryptocurrency markets and prices. Notably, these networks exhibit remarkably similar structures, hinting at exciting research opportunities for modeling such networks. |

However, the lack of relay rewards reduces the willingness of light nodes to relay transactions, especially in the energy-constrained complex wireless network. This paper proposes a novel dual auction mechanism to allocate transaction fees for relay and validation behaviors in the wireless blockchain network. The dual auction mechanism consists of two sub-auction stages: the relay sub-auction and the validation sub-auction. In the relay sub-auction, relay nodes choose transactions based rewards to forward. Besides, relay nodes adjust the relaying probability through a no-regret algorithm to improve efficiency. In the validation sub-auction, full nodes select transactions using Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism to construct the block. We prove that the designed dual auction mechanism is Incentive Compatibility (IC), Individual Rationality (IR), and Computational Efficiency (CE). We also derive the upper bound of the social welfare difference between the social optimal auction and our proposed one. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dual auction mechanism decreases energy and bandwidth resource consumption and effectively improves social welfare without sacrificing the throughput and the security of the wireless blockchain network. |

Accountable safety means that in any case of inconsistency, a certain fraction of validators can be identified to have provably violated the protocol. Earlier works have developed impossibility results and protocol constructions for these properties separately. We show that accountable safety implies finality, thereby unifying earlier results. |
|**2024-07-18**|**Improving the Accuracy of Transaction-Based Ponzi Detection on Ethereum**|Phuong Duy Huynh et.al.|[2308.16391](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16391)| The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on the Ethereum blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto investors. A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code. This contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not robust because a Ponzi developer can fool a detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit distribution logic that cannot be detected. On the contrary, a transaction-based approach could improve the robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection models achieve fairly low accuracy. In this paper, we aim to improve the accuracy of the transaction-based models by employing time-series features, which turn out to be crucial in capturing the life-time behaviour a Ponzi application but were completely overlooked in previous works. We propose a new set of 85 features (22 known account-based and 63 new time-series features), which allows off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to achieve up to 30% higher F1-scores compared to existing works. |

DeFi aims to create a transparent and efficient financial ecosystem using smart contracts and emerging decentralized applications. However, the growing popularity of DeFi has made it a target for fraudulent activities, resulting in losses of billions of dollars due to various types of frauds. To address these issues, researchers have explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to detect such fraudulent activities. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic survey to organize and summarize those existing works and to identify the future research opportunities. In this survey, we provide a systematic taxonomy of various frauds in the DeFi ecosystem, categorized by the different stages of a DeFi project's life cycle: project development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This taxonomy is based on our finding: many frauds have strong correlations in the stage of the DeFi project. According to the taxonomy, we review existing AI-powered detection methods, including statistical modeling, natural language processing and other machine learning techniques, etc. We find that fraud detection in different stages employs distinct types of methods and observe the commendable performance of tree-based and graph-related models in tackling fraud detection tasks. By analyzing the challenges and trends, we present the findings to provide proactive suggestion and guide future research in DeFi fraud detection. We believe that this survey is able to support researchers, practitioners, and regulators in establishing a secure and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem. |

To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel collaborative learning framework designed to detect attacks in blockchain transactions and smart contracts by analyzing transaction features. Our framework exhibits the capability to classify various types of blockchain attacks, including intricate attacks at the machine code level (e.g., injecting malicious codes to withdraw coins from users unlawfully), which typically necessitate significant time and security expertise to detect. To achieve that, the proposed framework incorporates a unique tool that transforms transaction features into visual representations, facilitating efficient analysis and classification of low-level machine codes. Furthermore, we propose an advanced collaborative learning model to enable real-time detection of diverse attack types at distributed mining nodes. Our model can efficiently detect attacks in smart contracts and transactions for blockchain systems without the need to gather all data from mining nodes into a centralized server. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we deploy a pilot system based on a private Ethereum network and conduct multiple attack scenarios to generate a novel dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the most comprehensive and diverse collection of transactions and smart contracts synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattack detection in blockchain systems. Our framework achieves a detection accuracy of approximately 94% through extensive simulations and 91% in real-time experiments with a throughput of over 2,150 transactions per second. |

Therefore, this research proposes a blockchain platform to aid in managing kidneys in the supply chain. This framework establishes a secure system that meticulously tracks the organ's location and handling, safeguarding the health from donor to recipient. Additionally, a machine-learning algorithm is embedded to monitor organ health in real-time against various metrics for prompt detection of possible kidney damage. |

This is hindering the provisioning of quality-of-service guarantees for real-time applications like video calls and gaming, cloud-based systems, financial transactions, telesurgery, and other remote applications that benefit from reliable communication. This paper introduces Hummingbird, a novel lightweight inter-domain bandwidth-reservation system that addresses several shortcomings of previous designs.   Hummingbird supports flexible and composable reservations and enables end-to-end guarantees without requiring autonomous systems to manage reservations for their endhosts. Previous systems tied reservations to autonomous-system numbers or network addresses, which limits the flexibility of reservations. In contrast, our system decouples reservations from network identities and, as a result, the control plane from the data plane. This design choice facilitates multiple co-existing control-plane mechanisms and enables innovative approaches, such as a control plane based on blockchain smart contracts that offers tradeable bandwidth-reservation assets and end-to-end guarantees. The data-plane design ensures simplicity for efficient processing on border routers, which streamlines implementation, deployment, and traffic policing while maintaining robust security properties. |
|**2024-01-15**|**A Study of MEV Extraction Techniques on a First-Come-First-Served Blockchain**|Burak Öz et.al.|[2308.06513](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06513)| Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has become a significant incentive on blockchain networks, referring to the value captured through the manipulation of transaction execution order and strategic issuance of profit-generation transactions. We argue that transaction ordering techniques used for MEV extraction in blockchains where fees can influence the execution order do not directly apply to blockchains where the order is determined based on transactions' arrival times. Such blockchains' First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) nature can yield different optimization strategies for entities seeking MEV, known as searchers, requiring further study. This paper explores the applicability of MEV extraction techniques observed on Ethereum, a fee-based blockchain, to Algorand, an FCFS blockchain. Our results show the prevalence of arbitrage MEV getting extracted through backruns on pending transactions in the network, uniformly distributed to block positions. However, on-chain data do not reveal latency optimizations between specific MEV searchers and Algorand block proposers. We also study network clogging attacks and argue how searchers can exploit them as a viable ordering technique for MEV extraction in FCFS networks. |

Nevertheless, people are concerned about whether foundation model based AI systems are properly governed to ensure the trustworthiness and to prevent misuse that could harm humans, society and the environment. In this paper, we identify eight governance challenges of foundation model based AI systems regarding the three fundamental dimensions of governance: decision rights, incentives, and accountability. Furthermore, we explore the potential of blockchain as an architectural solution to address the challenges by providing a distributed ledger to facilitate decentralised governance. We present an architecture that demonstrates how blockchain can be leveraged to realise governance in foundation model based AI systems. |

In this paper, we aim to re-purpose the energy by replacing the hash function with real-life problems having commercial utility. We propose Chrisimos, a useful Proof-of-Work where miners are required to find a minimal dominating set for real-life graph instances. A miner who is able to output the smallest dominating set for the given graph within the block interval time wins the mining game. We also propose a new chain selection rule that ensures the security of the scheme. Thus our protocol also realizes a decentralized minimal dominating set solver for any graph instance. We provide formal proof of correctness and show via experimental results that the block interval time is within feasible bounds of hash-based PoW. |

However, these properties do not always generalize to a setting across multiple independent blockchains. Despite the growing number of existing blockchain platforms, there is a lack of an overarching framework whose components provide all of the necessary properties for practical cross-chain commerce. We present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework. BlockChain I/O introduces entities called cross-chain services to relay information between different blockchains. The proposed design ensures that cross-chain services cannot violate transaction safety, and they are furthermore disincentivized from other types of misbehavior through an audit system. BlockChain I/O uses native stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a decentralized ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating privacy. After presenting the core architecture of BlockChain I/O, we demonstrate how to use it to implement a cross-chain marketplace and discuss how its desirable properties continue to hold in the end-to-end system. Finally, we use experimental evaluations to demonstrate BlockChain I/O's practical performance. |

As this market rapidly evolves, it necessitates re-evaluating which cryptocurrencies command the market and steer the direction of blockchain technology. We implement a network-based cryptocurrency market analysis to investigate this changing landscape. We use novel hourly-resolution data and Kendall's Tau correlation to explore the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market. We observed critical differences in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies determined by our method compared to rankings derived from daily data and Pearson's correlation. This divergence emphasizes the potential information loss stemming from daily data aggregation and highlights the limitations of Pearson's correlation. Our findings show that in the early stages of this growth, Bitcoin held a leading role. However, during the 2021 bull run, the landscape changed drastically. We see that while Ethereum has emerged as the overall leader, it was FTT and its associated exchange, FTX, that greatly led to the increase at the beginning of the bull run. We also find that highly-influential cryptocurrencies are increasingly gaining a commanding influence over the market as time progresses, despite the growing number of cryptocurrencies making up the market. |

This is because different blockchain platforms have different environments and characteristics for executing smart contracts. The focus of this paper is to study the security risks associated with the migration of smart contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum. We collected relevant data and analyzed smart contract migration cases to explore the differences between Ethereum and Arbitrum in areas such as Arbitrum cross-chain messaging, block properties, contract address alias, and gas fees. From the 36 types of smart contract migration cases we identified, we selected 4 typical types of cases and summarized their security risks. The research shows that smart contracts deployed on Ethereum may face certain potential security risks during migration to Arbitrum, mainly due to issues inherent in public blockchain characteristics, such as outdated off-chain data obtained by the inactive sequencer, logic errors based on time, the permission check failed, Denial of Service(DOS) attacks. To mitigate these security risks, we proposed avoidance methods and provided considerations for users and developers to ensure a secure migration process. It's worth noting that this study is the first to conduct an in-depth analysis of the secure migration of smart contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum. |

IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications.   We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6\% detection rate and mitigate 100\% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead. We followed responsible disclosure procedures, and our countermeasures are scheduled for deployment in the future versions of IPFS. |

The ultimate goal of this research is addressing several phenomena broadly classed under MEV with sandwich attacks as the canonical example. The literature has primarily viewed MEV as a problem arising from oversights in distributed systems and cryptographic protocol design and has attempted to address it with the standard tool sets from those disciplines. This paper argues that the impact of private mempools on markets and agent incentives renders analyses that do not consider the economic lens incomplete. The paper presents several observations across blockchains and traditional finance to justify this argument and highlight specific dynamics for future study. |

Winecoff et.al.|[2307.10222](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10222)| Proponents and developers of Web3 and blockchain argue that these technologies can revolutionize how people live and work by empowering individuals and distributing decision-making power. While technologists often have expansive hopes for what their technologies will accomplish over the long term, the practical challenges of developing, scaling, and maintaining systems amidst present-day constraints can compromise progress toward this vision. How technologists think about the technological future they hope to enable and how they navigate day-to-day issues impacts the form technologies take, their potential benefits, and their potential harms. In our current work, we aimed to explore the visions of Web3 and blockchain technologists and identify the immediate challenges that could threaten their visions. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 operators and professional investors in the Web3 and blockchain field. Our findings revealed that participants supported several ideological goals for their projects, with decentralization being a pivotal mechanism to enable user autonomy, distribute governance power, and promote financial inclusion. However, participants acknowledged the practical difficulties in fulfilling these promises, including the need for rapid technology development, conflicts of interest among stakeholders due to platform financing dynamics, and the challenge of expanding to mainstream users who may not share the "Web3 ethos." If negotiated ineffectively, these challenges could lead to negative outcomes, such as corrupt governance, increased inequality, and increased prevalence of scams and dubious investment schemes. While participants thought education, regulation, and a renewed commitment to the original blockchain ideals could alleviate some problems, they expressed skepticism about the potential of these solutions. |

Such discrepancies can lead to challenges in providing both privacy and accountability while maintaining accurate billing. To overcome these challenges, a universal cost splitting mechanism is proposed that prioritises privacy and accountability. It leverages a homomorphic encryption cryptosystem to provide privacy and employs blockchain technology to establish accountability. A dispute resolution mechanism is also introduced to minimise the occurrence of erroneous bill calculations while ensuring accountability and non-repudiation throughout the billing process.

|**2024-05-04**|**Vector Commitments with Efficient Updates**|Ertem Nusret Tas et.al.|[2307.04085](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04085)| Dynamic vector commitments that enable local updates of opening proofs have applications ranging from verifiable databases with membership changes to stateless clients on blockchains. In these applications, each user maintains a relevant subset of the committed messages and the corresponding opening proofs with the goal of ensuring a succinct global state. When the messages are updated, users are given some global update information and update their opening proofs to match the new vector commitment. We investigate the relation between the size of the update information and the runtime complexity needed to update an individual opening proof. Existing vector commitment schemes require that either the information size or the runtime scale linearly in the number $k$ of updated state elements. We construct a vector commitment scheme that asymptotically achieves both length and runtime that is sublinear in $k$, namely $k^\nu$ and $k^{1-\nu}$ for any $\nu \in (0,1)$. We prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the relation between the update information size and runtime complexity that shows the asymptotic optimality of our scheme. For $\nu = 1/2$, our constructions outperform Verkle commitments by about a factor of $2$ in terms of both the update information size and runtime, but makes use of larger public parameters. |

This constitutes a major flaw discovered with the introduction of decentralized finance and allows miners to perform MEV attacks. In this paper, we address the issue of sandwich attacks by providing a construction that takes as input a blockchain protocol and outputs a new blockchain protocol with the same security but in which sandwich attacks are not profitable. Furthermore, our protocol is fully decentralized with no trusted third parties or heavy cryptography primitives and carries a linear increase in latency and minimum computation overhead. |

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is pivotal in this regard, offering an exhaustive inventory of components and dependencies crucial to software development. However, prevalent challenges in SBOM sharing, such as data tampering risks and vendors' reluctance to fully disclose sensitive information, significantly hinder its effective implementation. These challenges pose a notable threat to the security of critical infrastructure and systems where transparency and trust are paramount, underscoring the need for a more secure and flexible mechanism for SBOM sharing. To bridge the gap, this study introduces a blockchain-empowered architecture for SBOM sharing, leveraging verifiable credentials to allow for selective disclosure. This strategy not only heightens security but also offers flexibility. Furthermore, this paper broadens the remit of SBOM to encompass AI systems, thereby coining the term AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). The advent of AI and its application in critical infrastructure necessitates a nuanced understanding of AI software components, including their origins and interdependencies. The evaluation of our solution indicates the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed SBOM sharing mechanism, positing a solution for safeguarding (AI) software supply chains, which is essential for the resilience and reliability of modern critical infrastructure systems. |

Our central assumption is that trades are batched before execution. Because of competition between arbitrageurs, the FM-AMM eliminates arbitrage profits (or LVR) and sandwich attacks, currently the two main problems in decentralized finance and blockchain design more broadly. We then consider 11 token pairs and use Binance price data to simulate the lower bound to the return of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM. Such a lower bound is, for the most part, slightly higher than the empirical returns of providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 (currently the dominant AMM). |
|**2023-10-03**|**Transaction Fee Mechanism Design with Active Block Producers**|Maryam Bahrani et.al.|[2307.01686](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01686)| The incentive-compatibility properties of blockchain transaction fee mechanisms have been investigated with *passive* block producers that are motivated purely by the net rewards earned at the consensus layer. This paper introduces a model of *active* block producers that have their own private valuations for blocks (representing, for example, additional value derived from the application layer). The block producer surplus in our model can be interpreted as one of the more common colloquial meanings of the term ``MEV.''   The main results of this paper show that transaction fee mechanism design is fundamentally more difficult with active block producers than with passive ones: with active block producers, no non-trivial or approximately welfare-maximizing transaction fee mechanism can be incentive-compatible for both users and block producers. These results can be interpreted as a mathematical justification for the current interest in augmenting transaction fee mechanisms with additional components such as order flow auctions, block producer competition, trusted hardware, or cryptographic techniques. |
|**2024-03-28**|**With Trail to Follow: Measurements of Real-world Non-fungible Token Phishing Attacks on Ethereum**|Jingjing Yang et.al.|[2307.01579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01579)| With the popularity of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), NFTs have become a new target of phishing attacks, posing a significant threat to the NFT trading ecosystem. There has been growing anecdotal evidence that new means of NFT phishing attacks have emerged in Ethereum ecosystem. Most of the existing research focus on detecting phishing scam accounts for native cryptocurrency on the blockchain, but there is a lack of research in the area of phishing attacks of emerging NFTs. Although a few studies have recently started to focus on the analysis and detection of NFT phishing attacks, NFT phishing attack means are diverse and little has been done to understand these various types of NFT phishing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct case retrospective analysis and measurement study of real-world historical NFT phishing attacks on Ethereum. By manually analyzing the existing scams reported by Chainabuse, we classify NFT phishing attacks into four patterns. For each pattern, we further investigate the tricks and working principles of them. Based on 469 NFT phishing accounts collected up until October 2022 from multiple channels, we perform a measurement study of on-chain transaction data crawled from Etherscan to characterizing NFT phishing scams by analyzing the modus operandi and preferences of NFT phishing scammers, as well as economic impacts and whereabouts of stolen NFTs. We classify NFT phishing transactions into one of the four patterns by log parsing and transaction record parsing. We find these phishing accounts stole 19,514 NFTs for a total profit of 8,858.431 ETH (around 18.57 million dollars). We also observe that scammers remain highly active in the last two years and favor certain categories and series of NFTs, accompanied with signs of gang theft. |

When realizing such an application, data might be stored and retrieved from one or more blockchains by distributed network nodes without relying on centralized coordination and trusted third parties. Data access could be provided through a query language such as SQL at the application level, establishing a unified view on application-level data that is verifiably stored. However, when accessing multiple blockchains through their node software and APIs, interoperability cannot be assumed today, resulting in challenges of inhomogeneous data access. In addition, different feature sets and trade-offs exist, e.g., regarding smart contract functionality, availability, distribution, scalability, and security. For increasing interoperability, the paper at hand suggests pursuing the development of a cross-chain query language at the application level. The language abstracts from implementation by providing a standardized syntax, an integrated data model, and a processing architecture for data queries. This research is an extended and updated paper of a prior publication demonstrating the language syntax, data model, and architecture with an evaluation of compatibility against the largest open and permissionless blockchains today. |

However, most existing FL approaches rely on a centralized server for global model aggregation, leading to a single point of failure. This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that our framework is robust against malicious client-side behaviors. |

Double-spending is a problem where the same tender is spent multiple times during a digital currency transaction, while selfish mining is an intentional alteration of a blockchain to increase rewards to one miner or a group of miners. We introduce a new attack that combines both these attacks and propose a machine learning-based solution to mitigate the risks associated with them. Specifically, we use the learning automaton, a powerful online learning method, to develop two models, namely the SDTLA and WVBM, which can effectively defend against selfish mining attacks. Our experimental results show that the SDTLA method increases the profitability threshold of selfish mining up to 47 $\%$, while the WVBM method performs even better and is very close to the ideal situation where each miner's revenue is proportional to their shared hash processing power. Additionally, we demonstrate that both methods can effectively reduce the risks of double-spending by tuning the $Z$ Parameter. Our findings highlight the potential of SDTLA and WVBM as promising solutions for enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain networks. |

However, repositioning is costly, because LPs have to pay gas fees for each update. We analyze the causal relation between repositioning and liquidity concentration around the market price, using the entry of blockchain scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Polygon, as our instruments. Lower gas fees on scaling solutions allow LPs to update more frequently than on Ethereum. Our results demonstrate that higher repositioning intensity and precision lead to greater liquidity concentration, which benefits small trades by reducing their slippage. |

Here we present a grassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social networks termed Grassroots Social Networking that aims to address this challenge. The architecture is geared for people with networked smartphones -- roaming (address-changing) computing devices communicating over an unreliable network (e.g., using UDP). The architecture incorporates (i) a decentralized social graph, where each person controls, maintains and stores only their local neighborhood in the graph; (iii) personal feeds, with authors and followers who create and store the feeds; and (ii) a grassroots dissemination protocol, in which communication among people occurs only along the edges of their social graph. The architecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a partially-ordered conflict-free counterpart of the totally-ordered conflict-based blockchain. We provide two example Grassroots Social Networking protocols -- Twitter-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their security (safety, liveness and privacy), spam/bot/deep-fake resistance, and implementation, demonstrating how server-based social networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture. |
|**2024-06-03**|**Evaluating and Managing Tokenomics for Non-Fungible Tokens in Game-Based Blockchain Networks**|Hyoungsung Kim et.al.|[2306.13672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13672)| Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming increasingly popular in Play-to-Earn (P2E) Web3 applications as a means of incentivizing user engagement. In Web3, users with NFTs ownership are entitled to monetize them. However, due to lack of objective NFT valuation, which makes NFT value determination challenging, P2E applications ecosystems have experienced inflation. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NFT inflation value management in P2E applications. Our method leverages the contribution-rewards model proposed by Curve Finance and the automated market maker (AMM) of decentralized exchanges. In decentralized systems, P2E Web3 applications inclusive, not all participants contribute in good faith. Therefore, rewards are provided to incentivize contribution. Our mechanism proves that burning NFTs, indicating the permanent removal of NFTs, contributes to managing inflation by reducing the number of NFTs in circulation. As a reward for this contribution, our method mints a compensation (CP) token as an ERC-20 token, which can be exchanged for NFTs once enough tokens have been accumulated. To further increase the value of the CP token, we suggest using governance tokens and CP tokens to create liquidity pools for AMM. The value of the governance token is determined by the market, and the CP token derives its value from the governance token in AMM. The CP token can determine its worth based on the market value of the governance token. Additionally, since CP tokens are used for exchanging NFTs, the value of the NFT is ultimately determined by the value of the CP token. To further illustrate our concept, we show how to adjust burning rewards based on factors such as the probability of upgrading NFTs' rarity or the current swap ratio of governance and CP tokens in AMM. |

In traditional centralized federated learning, the selection of local nodes and the collection of learning results for each round are merged under the control of a central server. In contrast, in BCFL, all these processes are monitored and managed via smart contracts. Additionally, we propose an extension architecture to support both crossdevice and cross-silo federated learning scenarios. Furthermore, we implement and verify the architecture in a practical real-world Ethereum development environment. Our BCFL reference architecture provides significant flexibility and extensibility, accommodating the integration of various additional elements, as per specific requirements and use cases, thereby rendering it an adaptable solution for a wide range of BCFL applications. As a prominent example of extensibility, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) have been employed as an authentication method to introduce practical utilization within BCFL. This study not only bridges a crucial gap between research and practical deployment but also lays a solid foundation for future explorations in the realm of BCFL. The pivotal contribution of this study is the successful implementation and verification of a realistic BCFL reference architecture. We intend to make the source code publicly accessible shortly, fostering further advancements and adaptations within the community. |

Among the methods for semantically representing agents, one has been essentially achieved by taking a behaviouristic vision, through which one can describe how they operate and engage with their peers. The approach essentially aims at defining the operational capabilities of agents through the mental states related with the achievement of tasks. The OASIS ontology -- An Ontology for Agent, Systems, and Integration of Services, presented in 2019 -- pursues the behaviouristic approach to deliver a semantic representation system and a communication protocol for agents and their commitments. This paper reports on the main modeling choices concerning the representation of agents in OASIS 2, the latest major upgrade of OASIS, and the achievement reached by the ontology since it was first introduced, in particular in the context of ontologies for blockchains. |

The global DeFi ecosystem is fragmented into multiple blockchains, fueling the demand for cross-chain commerce. Existing approaches for cross-chain transactions, e.g., bridges and cross-chain deals, achieve atomicity by locking assets in escrow. However, locking up assets increases the financial risks for the participants, especially due to price fluctuations and the long latency of cross-chain transactions. Stablecoins, which are pegged to a non-volatile asset such as the US dollar, help mitigate the risk associated with price fluctuations. However, existing stablecoin designs are tied to individual blockchain platforms, and trusted parties or complex protocols are needed to exchange stablecoin tokens between blockchains.   Our goal is to design a practical stablecoin for cross-chain commerce. Realizing this goal requires addressing two challenges. The first challenge is to support a large and growing number of blockchains efficiently. The second challenge is to be resilient to price fluctuations and blockchain platform failures. We present CroCoDai to address these challenges. We also present three prototype implementations of our stablecoin system, and show that it incurs small execution overhead. |

The popularity is partly due to their unique specifications originating from blockchain-related characteristics such as privacy, decentralisation, and untraceability. Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies remain a high-risk investment due to their price volatility and uncertainty. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with internal cryptocurrency-related factors and external influential global economic factors makes predicting their prices and price movement directions challenging. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from predicting the direction of cryptocurrency prices can provide valuable guidance for investors in making informed investment decisions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) approach, which can model complex systems in multivariate settings, to predict the price movement direction of five popular altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) in the next trading day. The efficacy of the proposed model in predicting cryptocurrency price directions is evaluated from two perspectives. Firstly, our proposed approach is compared to two baseline models, namely an auto-regressive integrated moving average and support vector regression. Secondly, from a feature engineering point of view, the impact of twenty-three different features, grouped into four categories, on the DBN's prediction performance is investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models. In addition, among the groups of features, technical indicators are found to be the most effective predictors of cryptocurrency price directions. |

By dividing the network into smaller components known as shards, a sharded blockchain can process transactions in parallel without introducing inconsistencies through the coordination of intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols. However, we observe a critical security issue with sharded systems: transaction ordering manipulations can occur when coordinating intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. Specifically, we identify a novel security issue known as finalization fairness, which can be exploited through a front-running attack. This attack allows an attacker to manipulate the execution order of transactions, even if the victim's transaction has already been processed and added to the blockchain by a fair intra-shard consensus.   To address the issue, we offer Haechi, a novel cross-shard protocol that is immune to front-running attacks. Haechi introduces an ordering phase between transaction processing and execution, ensuring that the execution order of transactions is the same as the processing order and achieving finalization fairness. To accommodate different consensus speeds among shards, Haechi incorporates a finalization fairness algorithm to achieve a globally fair order with minimal performance loss. By providing a global order, Haechi ensures strong consistency among shards, enabling better parallelism in handling conflicting transactions across shards. These features make Haechi a promising solution for supporting popular smart contracts in the real world. To evaluate Haechi's performance, we implemented the protocol using Tendermint and conducted extensive experiments on a geo-distributed AWS environment. Our results demonstrate that Haechi achieves finalization fairness with little performance sacrifice compared to existing cross-shard consensus protocols. |

This paper aims to take first steps to fill this gap. The ICT sector contributes up to 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-more than global air travel at 2.5 percent. The carbon footprint and water consumption of AI, especially large-scale generative models like GPT-4, raise significant sustainability concerns. The paper is the first to assess how current and proposed technology regulations, including EU environmental law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the AI Act, could be adjusted to better account for environmental sustainability. The GDPR, for instance, could be interpreted to limit certain individual rights like the right to erasure if these rights significantly conflict with broader sustainability goals. In a second step, the paper suggests a multi-faceted approach to achieve sustainable AI regulation. It advocates for transparency mechanisms, such as disclosing the GHG footprint of AI systems, as laid out in the proposed EU AI Act. However, sustainable AI regulation must go beyond mere transparency. The paper proposes a regulatory toolkit comprising co-regulation, sustainability-by-design principles, restrictions on training data, and consumption caps, including integration into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Finally, the paper argues that this regulatory toolkit could serve as a blueprint for regulating other high-emission technologies and infrastructures like blockchain, Metaverse applications, and data centers. The framework aims to cohesively address the crucial dual challenges of our era: digital transformation and climate change mitigation. |

We propose to use a variant, called coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum Proof-of-Work (PoW) scheme for blockchain consensus. The users perform boson sampling using input states that depend on the current block information and commit their samples to the network. Afterwards, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to both validate samples and reward successful miners. By combining rewards for miners committing honest samples together with penalties for miners committing dishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivizes honest nodes. We provide numerical evidence that these validation tests are hard to spoof classically without knowing the binning scheme ahead of time and show the robustness of our protocol to small partial distinguishability of photons. The scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling and provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by classical hardware. |

Governance protocols define the means for amending or changing these smart contracts without any centralized authority. They distribute the decision-making power to every user of the smart contract: Users vote on accepting or rejecting every change.   In this work, we review and characterize decentralized governance in practice, using Compound and Uniswap -- two widely used governance protocols -- as a case study. We reveal a high concentration of voting power in both Compound and Uniswap: 10 voters hold together 57.86% and 44.72% of the voting power, respectively. Although proposals to change or amend the protocol receive, on average, a substantial number of votes (i.e., 89.39%) in favor within the Compound protocol, they require fewer than three voters to obtain 50% or more votes. We show that voting on Compound proposals can be unfairly expensive for small token holders, and we discover voting coalitions that can further marginalize these users. |

While recent works predominantly focused on improving the scalability and throughput of these protocols, few of them addressed latency. We present Mercury, a novel transformation to autonomously optimize the latency of quorum-based BFT consensus. Mercury employs a dual resilience threshold that enables faster transaction ordering when the system contains few faulty replicas. Mercury allows forming compact quorums that substantially accelerate consensus using a smaller resilience threshold. Nevertheless, Mercury upholds standard SMR safety and liveness guarantees with optimal resilience, thanks to its judicious use of a dual operation mode and BFT forensics techniques. Our experiments spread tens of replicas across continents and reveal that Mercury can order transactions with finality in less than 0.4 seconds, half the time of a PBFT-like protocol (optimal in terms of number of communication steps and resilience) in the same network. Furthermore, Mercury matches the latency of running its base protocol on theoretically optimal internet links (transmitting at 67% of the speed of light). |

A drawback of this design is that when users submit a transaction, they cannot predict in which state it will be executed. This exposes them to transaction-ordering attacks, a widespread class of attacks where adversaries with the power to construct blocks of transactions can extract value from smart contracts (the so-called MEV attacks). The UTXO model is an alternative blockchain design that thwarts these attacks by requiring new transactions to spend past ones: since transactions have unique identifiers, reordering attacks are ineffective. Currently, the blockchains following the UTXO model either provide contracts with limited expressiveness (Bitcoin), or require complex run-time environments (Cardano). We present ILLUM , an Intermediate-Level Language for the UTXO Model. ILLUM can express real-world smart contracts, e.g. those found in Decentralized Finance. We define a compiler from ILLUM to a bare-bone UTXO blockchain with loop-free scripts. Our compilation target only requires minimal extensions to Bitcoin Script: in particular, we exploit covenants, a mechanism for preserving scripts along chains of transactions. We prove the security of our compiler: namely, any attack targeting the compiled contract is also observable at the ILLUM level. Hence, the compiler does not introduce new vulnerabilities that were not already present in the source ILLUM contract. We evaluate the practicality of ILLUM as a compilation target for higher-level languages. To this purpose, we implement a compiler from a contract language inspired by Solidity to ILLUM, and we apply it to a benchmark or real-world smart contracts. |

While not an issue initially, the emergence of decentralized finance has introduced new transaction order dependencies allowing parties in control of the ordering to make a profit by front-running others' transactions. In this work, we present the Decentralized Clock Network, a new approach for achieving fair transaction ordering. Users submit their transactions to the network's clocks, which run an agreement protocol that provides each transaction with a timestamp of receipt which is then used to define the transactions' order. By separating agreement from ordering, our protocol is efficient and has a simpler design compared to other available solutions. Moreover, our protocol brings to the blockchain world the paradigm of asynchronous fallback, where the algorithm operates with stronger fairness guarantees during periods of synchronous use, switching to an asynchronous mode only during times of increased network delay. |

Absolute commitments allow the strategy of an agent to depend on the commitments made by the other agents. This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game in which agents choose which strategies they commit to.   We say that a game that is unaffected by such commitments is Stackelberg resilient and show that computing it is intractible in general, although it can be computed efficiently for two-player games of perfect information. We show the intuitive, but technically non-trivial result, that, if a game is resilient when some number of players have the capacity to make commitments, it is also resilient when these commitments are available to fewer players. We demonstrate the non-triviality of Stackelberg resilience by analyzing two escrow mechanisms from the literature. These mechanisms have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient.   Our model is particularly relevant in Web3 scenarios, where these absolute commitments can be realized by the automated and irrevocable nature of smart contracts. Our work highlights an important issue in ensuring the secure design of Web3. In particular, our work suggests that smart contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks. |

Changing these rules can be risky and challenging. In addition, it can often be controversial and take much effort to make all the necessary participants agree to adopt a change. Arguably, Bitcoin has seen centralisation tendencies in pools and in development. However, how these tendencies influence blockchain governance has received minimal community and academic attention. Our study analyses the governmental structures in a blockchain by looking into the history of Bitcoin. We investigate the process of changing consensus rules through a grounded theory analysis comprising quantitative and qualitative data from 34 consensus forks in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The results reveal the decentralised behaviour in Bitcoin and blockchain. Our results are in contrast to related work, emphasising centralisation among miners and developers. Furthermore, our results show how the consensus-driven deployment techniques and governance of consensus rules are intertwined. |

To cope with the challenges of 4IR, there is a need for innovative and sustainable teaching and learning tools. AI and block chain technologies hold great promise in this regard, with potential benefits such as personalized learning, secure credentialing, and decentralized learning networks. This paper presents a review of existing research on AI and block chain in education, analyzing case studies and exploring the potential benefits and challenges of these technologies. The paper also suggests a unique model for integrating AI and block chain into sustainable teaching and learning practices. Future research directions are discussed, including the need for more empirical studies and the exploration of ethical and social implications. The key summary of this discussion is that, by enhancing accessibility, efficacy, and security in education, AI and blockchain have the potential to revolutionise the field. In order to ensure that students can benefit from these potentially game-changing technologies as technology develops, it will be crucial to find ways to harness its power while minimising hazards. Overall, this paper highlights the potential of AI and block chain as sustainable tools for teaching and learning in the 4IR era and their respective advantages, issues and future prospects have been discussed in this writing. |

|**2024-03-03**|**Permissionless Consensus**|Andrew Lewis-Pye et.al.|[2304.14701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14701)| Blockchain protocols typically aspire to run in the permissionless setting, in which nodes are owned and operated by a large number of diverse and unknown entities, with each node free to start or stop running the protocol at any time. This setting is more challenging than the traditional permissioned setting, in which the set of nodes that will be running the protocol is fixed and known at the time of protocol deployment. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework for reasoning about the rich design space of blockchain protocols and their capabilities and limitations in the permissionless setting.   We propose a hierarchy of settings with different "degrees of permissionlessness", specified by the amount of knowledge that a protocol has about the current participants: These are the fully permissionless, dynamically available and quasi-permissionless settings.   The paper also proves several results illustrating the utility of our analysis framework for reasoning about blockchain protocols in these settings. For example:   (1) In the fully permissionless setting, even with synchronous communication and with severe restrictions on the total size of the Byzantine players, every deterministic protocol for Byzantine agreement has a non-terminating execution.   (2) In the dynamically available and partially synchronous setting, no protocol can solve the Byzantine agreement problem with high probability, even if there are no Byzantine players at all.   (3) In the quasi-permissionless and partially synchronous setting, by contrast, assuming a bound on the total size of the Byzantine players, there is a deterministic protocol solving state machine replication.   (4) In the quasi-permissionless and synchronous setting, every proof-of-stake state machine replication protocol that uses only time-malleable cryptographic primitives is vulnerable to long-range attacks. |
|**2024-04-18**|**Resource Specifications for Resource-Manipulating Programs**|Zachary Grannan et.al.|[2304.12530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12530)| Specifications for modular program verifiers are expressed as constraints on program states (e.g. preconditions) and relations on program states (e.g. postconditions). For programs whose domain is managing resources of any kind (e.g. cryptocurrencies), such state-based specifications must make explicit properties that a human would implicitly understand for free. For example, it's clear that depositing into your bank account will not change other balances, but classically this must be stated as a frame condition. As a result, classical specifications for resource-manipulating programs quickly become verbose and difficult to interpret, write and debug.   In this paper, we present a novel methodology that extends a modular program verifier to support user-defined first-class resources, allowing resource-related operations and properties to be expressed directly and eliminating the need to reify implicit knowledge in the specifications. We implement our methodology as an extension of the program verifier Prusti, and use it to verify real-world smart contracts and a key part of a blockchain application. Our evaluation demonstrates that specifications written with our methodology are more concise and substantially simpler than specifications written purely in terms of program states. |

If complemented with heterogeneous trust and open membership, they have the potential to serve as blockchains backbone. This paper presents a general model of heterogeneous quorum systems where each participant can declare its own quorums, and captures the consistency, availability and inclusion properties of these systems. In order to support open membership, it then presents reconfiguration protocols for heterogeneous quorum systems including joining and leaving of a process, and adding and removing of a quorum, and further, proves their correctness in the face of Byzantine attacks. The design of the protocols is informed by the trade-offs that the paper proves for the properties that reconfigurations can preserve. The paper further presents a graph characterization of heterogeneous quorum systems, and its application for reconfiguration optimization. |

Fiber communication lines and satellite-to-ground links have served as the basis for the most successful quantum networks that have been developed so far. Using a UAV, satellite or both for free-space quantum communication reduces the need for permanent ground connections and takes advantage of the lower loss limit in space, which makes it more efficient. This work surveys the recent development in Quantum Satellites and Quantum UAVs-based networks. Here, the importance of the latest technologies, including quantum artificial intelligence, blockchain quantum machine learning, quantum satellites and quantum UAVs, are explored from network perspectives. Further, this work discussed the role of satellite-based images and artificial intelligence. |

The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing. This paper presents a mathematics that is inspired by these considerations. It is interesting in and of itself, much like point-set topology is; and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems. |

State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security-performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC. |

Unlike existing applications like Kleros, privacy is ensured by design through the use of the zero-knowledge protocols Semaphore and MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure), which provide, among other things, resistance to Sybil-like attacks and corruption. Differently from Kleros, dispute resolution is guaranteed despite the users having the final say. Moreover, the proposed model does not use a native token on the platform, but aims to reward stakeholders through a social incentive mechanism based on soulbound tokens, introduced by Weyl, Ohlhaver, and Buterin in 2022. Users with these tokens will be considered trustworthy and will have the ability to govern the platform. As far as we know, this is one of the first blockchain projects that seeks to introduce social governance rather than one based on economic incentives. |
|**2024-04-21**|**Maximizing Miner Revenue in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Ke Wu et.al.|[2302.12895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12895)| Transaction fee mechanism design is a new decentralized mechanism design problem where users bid for space on the blockchain. Several recent works showed that the transaction fee mechanism design fundamentally departs from classical mechanism design. They then systematically explored the mathematical landscape of this new decentralized mechanism design problem in two settings: in the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a cryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by a multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior works showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for both users as well as miners (possibly colluding with users), then the miner revenue has to be zero. Although adopting a relaxed, approximate notion of incentive compatibility gets around this zero miner-revenue limitation, the scaling of the miner revenue is nonetheless poor.   In this paper, we show that if we make a mildly stronger reasonable-world assumption than prior works, we can circumvent the known limitations on miner revenue, and design auctions that generate optimal miner revenue. We also systematically explore the mathematical landscape of transaction fee mechanism design under the new reasonable-world and demonstrate how such assumptions can alter the feasibility and infeasibility landscape. |

The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integrating it into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the very attractive decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received both by the research and industry in the past years and it is being increasingly deployed nowadays in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate what would be the pros and cons and what would be the best applications when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of technical literature research on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration to shed light on challenges and potentials. While this combination is still in its infancy and a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic understanding of blockchains applicability in the biometric sector. This study demonstrates that combining blockchain and biometrics would be beneficial for novel applications in biometrics such as the PKI mechanism, distributed trusted service, and identity management. However, blockchain networks at their current stage are not efficient and economical for real-time applications. From a legal point of view, the allocation of accountability remains a main issue, while other difficulties remain, such as conducting a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment. Finally, it supplies technical and legal recommendations to reap the benefits and mitigate the risks of the combination. |
|**2024-07-19**|**Resilient Consensus Sustained Collaboratively**|Junchao Chen et.al.|[2302.02325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02325)| Decentralized systems built around blockchain technology promise clients an immutable ledger. They add a transaction to the ledger after it undergoes consensus among the replicas that run a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol. Unfortunately, these protocols face a long-range attack where an adversary having access to the private keys of the replicas can rewrite the ledger. One solution is forcing each committed block from these protocols to undergo another consensus, Proof-of-Work(PoW) consensus; PoW protocol leads to wastage of computational resources as miners compete to solve complex puzzles. In this paper, we present the design of our Power-of-Collaboration (PoC) protocol, which guards existing PoS/BFT blockchains against long-range attacks and requires miners to collaborate rather than compete. PoC guarantees fairness and accountability and only marginally degrades the throughput of the underlying system. |

|**2023-09-27**|**Order but Not Execute in Order**|Tiantian Gong et.al.|[2302.01177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01177)| This work aims to address the general order manipulation issue in blockchain-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) by exploring the benefits of employing a novel combination of order-fair atomic broadcast (of-ABC) mechanisms for transaction ordering and frequent batch auction (FBA) for breaking the order while executing those transactions. In of-ABC, transactions submitted to a sufficient number of blockchain validators are ordered before or along with later transactions. FBA then executes transactions with a uniform price double auction that prioritizes price instead of transaction order within the same committed batch.   To demonstrate the merits of our order-but-not-execute-in-order design, we compare the welfare loss and liquidity provision in DEX under FBA and its continuous counterpart, the Continuous Limit Order Book (CLOB). Assuming that the exchange is realized over an of-ABC protocol, we find that (1) FBA always achieves better social welfare when no party is privately informed about asset valuations. Even otherwise, FBA incurs less welfare loss compared to CLOB when (2) price takers and public information reflecting asset value changes arrives sufficiently frequently compared to private information, or (3) the priority fees are small, or (4) the market is more balanced on both sides. Our empirical analysis on dYdX transactions indicates additional $8\%-83\%$ costs when transactions are executed continuously. Further, our findings also indicate that liquidity provision is better under FBA under similar conditions. |

Over the last year, \$100 million worth of NFTs were stolen by drainers, and their presence remains a serious threat to the NFT trading space. However, no work has yet comprehensively investigated the behaviors of drainers in the NFT ecosystem.   In this paper, we present the first study on the trading behavior of NFT drainers and introduce the first dedicated NFT drainer detection system. We collect 127M NFT transaction data from the Ethereum blockchain and 1,135 drainer accounts from five sources for the year 2022. We find that drainers exhibit significantly different transactional and social contexts from those of regular users. With these insights, we design \textit{DRAINCLoG}, an automatic drainer detection system utilizing Graph Neural Networks. This system effectively captures the multifaceted web of interactions within the NFT space through two distinct graphs: the NFT-User graph for transaction contexts and the User graph for social contexts. Evaluations using real-world NFT transaction data underscore the robustness and precision of our model. Additionally, we analyze the security of \textit{DRAINCLoG} under a wide variety of evasion attacks. |

PACCs allow any smart contract wallet holder to collateralize a claim, request, or commitment in general, in a private and anonymous manner. PACCs can prove arbitrarily much or little about the wallet generating the commitment, and/or the transaction which is being committed. We demonstrate that PACCs can be applied to effectively eliminate maximal-extractable value (MEV) in DeFi where it currently occurs, shifting MEV instead to censorship. After describing our protocol with detail, we provide an implementation using the Ethereum blockchain, and whose benchmarks prove how PACCs are completely feasible. |
|**2024-09-03**|**Credible, Optimal Auctions via Public Broadcast**|Tarun Chitra et.al.|[2301.12532](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12532)| We study auction design in a setting where agents can communicate over a censorship-resistant broadcast channel like the ones we can implement over a public blockchain. We seek to design credible, strategyproof auctions in a model that differs from the traditional mechanism design framework because communication is not centralized via the auctioneer. We prove this allows us to design a larger class of credible auctions where the auctioneer has no incentive to be strategic. Intuitively, a decentralized communication model weakens the auctioneer's adversarial capabilities because they can only inject messages into the communication channel but not delete, delay, or modify the messages from legitimate buyers. Our main result is a separation in the following sense: we give the first instance of an auction that is credible only if communication is decentralized. Moreover, we construct the first two-round auction that is credible, strategyproof, and optimal when bidder valuations are $\alpha$-strongly regular, for $\alpha > 0$ . Our result relies on mild assumptions -- namely, the existence of a broadcast channel and cryptographic commitments. |

As a result digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading to the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon the testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for digital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a use case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed within this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the findings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors and developers. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential impacts and risks of other technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing this study provides a primer for users to begin planning a digital inheritance strategy and for developers to develop a more intuitive solution. |
|**2024-06-10**|**The Synchronic Web**|Thien-Nam Dinh et.al.|[2301.10733](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10733)| The Synchronic Web is a distributed network for securing data provenance on the World Wide Web. By enabling clients around the world to freely commit digital information into a single shared view of history, it provides a foundational basis of truth on which to build decentralized and scalable trust across the Internet. Its core cryptographical capability allows mutually distrusting parties to create and verify statements of the following form: "I commit to this information--and only this information--at this moment in time." The backbone of the Synchronic Web infrastructure is a simple, small, and semantic-free blockchain that is accessible to any Internet-enabled entity. The infrastructure is maintained by a permissioned network of well-known servers, called notaries, and accessed by a permissionless group of clients, called ledgers. Through an evolving stack of flexible and composable semantic specifications, the parties cooperate to generate synchronic commitments over arbitrary data. When integrated with existing infrastructures, adapted to diverse domains, and scaled across the breadth of cyberspace, the Synchronic Web provides a ubiquitous mechanism to lock the world's data into unique points in discrete time and digital space. |

Grassroots applications are potentially important as they may allow people to conduct their social, economic, civic, and political lives in the digital realm solely using the networked computing devices they own and operate (e.g., smartphones), free of third-party control, surveillance, manipulation, coercion, or rent seeking (e.g., by global digital platforms such as Facebook or Bitcoin).   Here, we formalize the notion of grassroots systems and grassroots implementations; specify an abstract grassroots dissemination protocol; describe and prove an implementation of grassroots dissemination for the model of asynchrony; extend the implementation to mobile (address-changing) devices that communicate via an unreliable network (e.g. smartphones using UDP); and discuss how grassroots dissemination can realize applications that support digital sovereignty -- grassroots social networking and grassroots currencies. The mathematical construction employs distributed multiagent transition systems to define the notions of grassroots protocols and grassroots implementations, to specify grassroots dissemination protocols and their implementation, and to prove their correctness. The implementation uses the blocklace -- a generalization of the blockchain that functions as a fault-tolerant, conflict-free replicated data type. |
|**2024-10-17**|**$π$QLB: A Privacy-preserving with Integrity-assuring Query Language for Blockchain**|Nasrin Sohrabi et.al.|[2212.14141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14141)| The increase in the adoption of blockchain technology in different application domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has raised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current blockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security and privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on those systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries to blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly jeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive information, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be comfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to ensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain database and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and computational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically deployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end, this paper proposes $\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that ensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results. Additionally, $\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by introducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database. $\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret sharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the traditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be efficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious behaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result. To the best of our knowledge, $\pi$ QLB is the first query model designed for blockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like queries. |

However, the integration of these devices brings many security issues. To address these concerns, Blockchain technology has been widely adopted due to its robust security characteristics, including immutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing blockchain within these networks is highly challenging due to the limited resources of the employed devices and the resource-intensive requirements of the blockchain. To overcome these challenges, a multitude of researchers have proposed lightweight blockchain solutions specifically designed for resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of lightweight blockchain solutions proposed in the literature. More precisely, we identify five areas within the "lightweight" concept, namely, blockchain architecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm, and storage method. We discuss the various methods employed in each "lightweight" category, highlighting existing gaps and identifying areas for improvement. Our review highlights the missing points in existing systems and paves the way to building a complete lightweight blockchain solution for networks of resource-constrained devices. |
|**2024-01-03**|**Specular: Towards Secure, Trust-minimized Optimistic Blockchain Execution**|Zhe Ye et.al.|[2212.05219](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05219)| An optimistic rollup (ORU) scales a blockchain's throughput by delegating computation to an untrusted remote chain (L2), refereeing any state claim disagreements between mutually distrusting L2 operators via an interactive dispute resolution protocol. State-of-the-art ORUs employ a monolithic dispute resolution protocol that tightly couples an L1 referee with a specific L2 client binary--oblivious to the system's higher-level semantics. We argue that this approach (1) magnifies monoculture failure risk, by precluding trust-minimized and permissionless participation using operator-chosen client software; (2) leads to an unnecessarily large and difficult-to-audit TCB; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered, yet opaque upgrade process--both further increasing auditing overhead, and broadening the governance attack surface. To address these concerns, we outline a methodology for designing a secure and resilient ORU with a minimal TCB, by facilitating opportunistic 1-of-N-version programming. Due to its unique challenges and opportunities, we ground this work concretely in the context of the Ethereum ecosystem--where ORUs have gained significant traction. Specifically, we design a semantically-aware proof system, natively targeting the EVM and its instruction set. We present an implementation in a new ORU, Specular, that opportunistically leverages Ethereum's existing client diversity with minimal source modification, demonstrating our approach's feasibility. |
|**2023-11-17**|**Formal Model-Driven Analysis of Resilience of GossipSub to Attacks from Misbehaving Peers**|Ankit Kumar et.al.|[2212.05197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05197)| GossipSub is a new peer-to-peer communication protocol designed to counter attacks from misbehaving peers by controlling what information is sent and to whom, via a score function computed by each peer that captures positive and negative behaviors of its neighbors. The score function depends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds) that can be configured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is written in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is supported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.   In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience of GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model of GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed by the GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security properties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior, and rewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can be configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad behavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations for two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains. We show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0 network (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving peers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously misbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores so that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub. |

Powerful players, such as miners, sequencers, and sophisticated bots, can reap significant profits by selectively including, excluding, or re-ordering user transactions. Such profits are called Miner/Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. MEV bears profound implications for blockchain security and decentralization. While numerous countermeasures have been proposed, there is no agreement on the best solution. Moreover, solutions developed in academic literature differ quite drastically from what is widely adopted by practitioners. For these reasons, this paper systematizes the knowledge of the theory and practice of MEV countermeasures. The contribution is twofold. First, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of 30 proposed MEV countermeasures, covering four different technical directions. Secondly, we empirically studied the most popular MEV-auction-based solution with rich blockchain and mempool data. We also present the Mempool Guru system, a public service system that collects, persists, and analyzes the Ethereum mempool data for research. In addition to gaining insights into MEV auction platforms' real-world operations, our study shed light on the prevalent censorship by MEV auction platforms as a result of the recent OFAC sanction, and its implication on blockchain properties. |

The digital era offers a shift towards unique digital identifiers for each citizen, enabling a 'citizen wallet' for easier access to personal documents like academic records and licences, with enhanced security through digital signatures. The European Commission's initiative for a digital wallet for every EU citizen aims to improve mobility and integration, leveraging the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) for harmonised citizen integration. This paper discusses how EBSI and the GLASS project can advance governance and streamline access to identity documents. |

We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$ . |

However, concerns have emerged about possible wash trading, a form of market manipulation in which one party repeatedly trades an NFT to inflate its volume artificially. Our research examines the effects of wash trading on the NFT market in Ethereum from the beginning until January 2022, using multiple approaches. We find that wash trading affects 5.66% of all NFT collections, with a total artificial volume of \$3,406,110,774. We look at two ways to profit from wash trading: Artificially increasing the price of the NFT and taking advantage of the token reward systems provided by some marketplaces. Our findings show that exploiting the token reward systems of NFTMs is much more profitable (mean gain of successful operations is \$ 1.055M on LooksRare), more likely to succeed (more than 80% of operations), and less risky than reselling an NFT at a higher price using wash trading (50% of activities result in a loss). Our research highlights that wash trading is frequent in Ethereum and that NFTMs should implement protective mechanisms to stop such illicit behavior. |

However, the inherent characteristics of blockchain hinder decentralized finance (DeFi) from accessing necessary sensitive user data. To address this challenge, we introduce a protocol that both safeguards user privacy and ensures data availability through the incorporation of homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge-proof techniques in blockchain technology. This novel protocol helps mitigate privacy risks caused by sensitive data leaks while improving the capital efficiency of the DeFi market. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of these privacy-preserving methods in on-chain ecosystems and cross-border financial applications. Our solution contributes to secure, user-centric solutions for DeFi while upholding principles of decentralization and privacy protection. |

Each network node of a blockchain may use a true random number generator (TRNG) and hash algorism to fulfil the PoR protocol. In this whitepaper, we give the consensus mechanism of the PoR protocol, and classify it into a new kind of randomized algorithms called Macau. The PoR protocol could generate a blockchain without any competition of computing power or stake of cryptocurrency. Besides, we give some advantages of integrating quantum random number generator (QRNG) chips into hardware wallets, and also discuss the way to cooperate with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology. |

Reasons come from two folds: Firstly, guaranteeing fairness between sellers and consumers is a challenging task as the deception of any participating parties is risk-free. This leads to the second issue where judging the behavior of data executors (such as cloud service providers) among distrustful parties is impractical in the context of traditional trading protocols. To fill the gaps, in this paper, we present a \underline{b}lockchain-based \underline{d}ata \underline{t}rading \underline{s}ystem, named BDTS. BDTS implements a fair-exchange protocol in which benign behaviors can get rewarded while dishonest behaviors will be punished. Our scheme requires the seller to provide consumers with the correct encryption keys for proper execution and encourage a rational data executor to behave faithfully for maximum benefits from rewards. We analyze the strategies of consumers, sellers, and dealers in the trading game and point out that everyone should be honest about their interests so that the game will reach Nash equilibrium. Evaluations prove efficiency and practicability. |

For meaningful security, $T$ can be at most subexponential in the security parameter $\lambda$ but has no lower bound. VDFs are useful in several applications ranging from randomness beacons to sustainable blockchains but are really rare in practice. The verification in all of these VDFs requires $\Omega(\lambda, \log{T})$ sequential time. This paper derives a verifiable delay function that is verifiable in $O(1)$-sequential time. The key observation is that the prior works use subexponentially-hard algebraic assumptions for their sequentiality. On the contrary, we derive our VDF from a polynomially-hard sequential assumption namely the time-lock puzzle over the group of known order. In particular, we show that time-lock puzzle can be sequentially-hard even when the order of the group is known but the delay parameter is polynomially-bounded i.e., $T \le \mathtt{poly}(\lambda)$. As an add-on advantage, our VDF requires only one sequential squaring to verify. Thus, in our VDF, the sequential effort required for verification is fixed and independent of the delay parameter $T$ . |

Decentralization is achieved by the blockchain, a permanent public ledger that contains a record of every transaction. The public ledger ensures transparency, which enables public verifiability but harms untraceability, fungibility, and anonymity. In the last decade, cryptocurrencies attracted millions of users, with their total market cap reaching approximately three trillion USD at its peak. However, their anonymity guarantees are poorly understood and plagued by widespread misbeliefs. Indeed, previous notions of privacy, anonymity, and traceability for cryptocurrencies are either non-quantitative or inapplicable, e.g., computationally hard to measure.   In this work, we put forward a formal framework to measure the (un)traceability and anonymity of cryptocurrencies, allowing us to quantitatively reason about the mixing characteristics of cryptocurrencies and the privacy-enhancing technologies built on top of them. Our methods apply absorbing Markov chains combined with Shannon entropy. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first practical, efficient, and probabilistic measure to assess the traceability of cryptocurrencies quantitatively, which also generalizes to entire cryptocurrency transaction graphs. We implement and extensively evaluate our proposed traceability measure on several cryptocurrency transaction graphs. Among other quantitative results, we find that in the studied one-week interval, the Bitcoin blockchain, on average, provided comparable but quantifiably more natural mixing than the Ethereum blockchain. |

Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered by existing systems. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and it enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics ("tokenomics"), (6) client API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. We also introduce a practical test, the "Minimum Decentralization Test" which can provide quick insights about the decentralization state of a blockchain system. To demonstrate how our stratified methodology can be used in practice, we apply it fully (layer by layer) to Bitcoin, and we provide examples of systems which comprise one or more "problematic" layers that cause them to fail the MDT. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, and suggests various potential directions where future research is needed. |

Recently, a large number of criminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing graph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on constructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the heterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction pattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can depict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally neglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real behavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation (TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based transaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed module can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection methods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the Ethereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal information for Ponzi scheme detection. |

Ethereum, which wished to keep the best of the two protocol designs (BFT and Nakomoto-style), now has a convoluted consensus protocol as its core. The result is a blockchain being possibly produced in a tree-like form while participants try to finalize blocks. We categorize different attacks jeopardizing the liveness of the protocol. The Ethereum community has responded by creating patches against some of them. We discovered a new attack on the patched protocol. To support our analysis, we propose a new high-level formalization of the properties of liveness and availability of the Ethereum blockchain, and we provide a pseudo-code. We believe this formalization to be helpful for other analyses as well. Our results yield that the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake has safety but only probabilistic liveness. The probability of the liveness is influenced by the parameter describing the time frame allowed for validators to change their mind about the current main chain. |

Existing solutions to boost the trust using a stronger blockchain, e.g., via checkpointing, requires the weaker blockchain to give up sovereignty. In this paper, we propose a family of protocols in which multiple blockchains interact to create a combined ledger with boosted trust. We show that even if several of the interacting blockchains cease to provide security guarantees, the combined ledger continues to be secure - our TrustBoost protocols achieve the optimal threshold of tolerating the insecure blockchains. This optimality, along with the necessity of blockchain interactions, is formally shown within the classic shared memory model, tackling the long standing open challenge of solving consensus in the presence of both Byzantine objects and processes. Furthermore, our proposed construction of TrustBoost simply operates via smart contracts and require no change to the underlying consensus protocols of the participating blockchains, a form of ``consensus on top of consensus''. The protocols are lightweight and can be used on specific (e.g., high value) transactions; we demonstrate the practicality by implementing and deploying TrustBoost as cross-chain smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem using approximately 3,000 lines of Rust code, made available as open source. Our evaluation shows that using 10 Cosmos chains in a local testnet, TrustBoost has a gas cost of roughly $2 with a latency of 2 minutes per request, which is in line with the cost on a high security chain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum |

Constant function market makers (CFMMs) are another market design innovation praised for their computational simplicity and applicability to liquidity provision via smart contracts. Liquidity provision in batch exchanges is an important problem, and CFMMs have recently shown promise in being useful within batch exchanges. Different real-world implementations have used fundamentally different approaches towards integrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, and there is a lack of formal understanding of different design tradeoffs.   We first provide a minimal set of axioms that are well-accepted rules of batch exchanges and CFMMs. These are asset conservation, uniform valuations, a best response for limit orders, and non-decreasing CFMM trading function. In general, many market solutions may satisfy all our axioms. We then describe several economically useful properties of market solutions. These include Pareto optimality for limit orders, price coherence of CFMMs (as a defence against cyclic arbitrage), joint price discovery for CFMMs (as a defence against parallel running), path independence for simple instances, and a locally computable response of the CFMMs in equilibrium (to provide them predictability on trade size given a market price). We show fundamental conflicts between some pairs of these properties. We then provide two ways of integrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, which attain different subsets of these properties. We further provide a convex program for computing Arrow-Debreu exchange market equilibria when all agents have weak gross substitute (WGS) demand functions on two assets -- this program extends the literature on Arrow-Debreu exchange markets and may be of independent interest. |

|**2024-08-28**|**Bayesian Mechanism Design for Blockchain Transaction Fee Allocation**|Xi Chen et.al.|[2209.13099](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13099)| In blockchain systems, the design of transaction fee mechanisms is essential for stability and satisfaction for both miners and users. A recent work has proven the impossibility of collusion-proof mechanisms that achieve both non-zero miner revenue and Dominating-Strategy-Incentive-Compatible (DSIC) for users. However, a positive miner revenue is important in practice to motivate miners. To address this challenge, we consider a Bayesian game setting and relax the DSIC requirement for users to Bayesian-Nash-Incentive-Compatibility (BNIC). In particular, we propose an auxiliary mechanism method that makes connections between BNIC and DSIC mechanisms. With the auxiliary mechanism method, we design a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) based on the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, and prove that the TFM has both BNIC and collusion-proof properties with an asymptotic constant-factor approximation of optimal miner revenue for i.i.d. bounded valuations.

The security of the LN relies on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by settling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain within a pre-agreed time period. We study the susceptibility of the LN to mass exit attacks in case of high transaction congestion, in the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes that forces a large set of honest users to interact with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first is a zombie attack, where a set of k nodes become unresponsive with the goal of locking the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than what the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a mass double-spend attack, where a set of k nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many closing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this causes many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating transactions. We show via simulations that, under historically plausible congestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances, both attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our simulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of k adversarial nodes as a graph cut problem. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical justifications based on the scale-free topology of the LN. |

Despite these concerns, policy interventions targeting cryptocurrency operations in the pursuit of sustainability have largely been ineffective. Some were abandoned for fear of jeopardizing innovation, whereas others failed due to the highly globalized nature of blockchain systems. In search of a more effective angle for energy policy measures, this study adopts a consumer-centric perspective, examining the sentiments of Nigerian cryptocurrency users ( ${n=158}$ ) toward Bitcoin's sustainability, a representative cryptocurrency known for its high electricity demand. Three main findings emerged: 1) Even among those self-identifying as highly knowledgeable, most considerably underestimated Bitcoin's electricity consumption. 2) Participants with a more accurate understanding of Bitcoin's energy demand were more inclined to support sustainability measures. 3) Most of this supportive cohort viewed private entities as the primary stakeholders for implementing such measures. Given these findings, we suggest that consumer education should be at the forefront of policy initiatives aimed at cryptocurrency sustainability. |

Selfish mining can preserve discovered blocks and strategically release them, wasting honest miners' computing resources and getting higher profits. Previous mining attacks either conceal the mined whole blocks (hiding or discarding), or release them completely in a particular time slot (e.g., causing a fork). In this paper, we extend the mining attack's strategy space to partial block sharing, and propose a new and feasible Partial Selfish Mining (PSM) attack. We show that by releasing partial block data publicly and attracting rational miners to work on attacker's private branch, attackers and these attracted miners can gain an unfair share of mining rewards. We then propose Advanced PSM (A-PSM) attack that can further improve attackers' profits to be no less than the selfish mining. Both theoretical and experimental results show that PSM attackers can be more profitable than selfish miners under a certain range of mining power and network conditions. A-PSM attackers can gain even higher profits than both selfish mining and honest mining with attracted rational miners. |

Past studies explored non-monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., mugs and shirts) and monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., rebates that return some of the donations to the giver). Following the rapid growth of blockchain technology, a novel form of thank-you gifts emerged: the crypto rewards. Through two studies, we analyze crypto thank-you gifts to shed light on fundraising designs in the digital world. In Study I, we examine the Ukrainian government's crypto fundraising plea that accepts donations in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. We find that Ethereum is substantially more effective in enticing giving than Bitcoin, as the hourly donation count increased 706.07% more for Ethereum than for Bitcoin when crypto rewards are present. This is likely because the crypto rewards are more likely to be issued on Ethereum than Bitcoin. However, the decrease in contribution sizes is also more substantial in Ethereum than in Bitcoin in response to the crypto rewards. In Study II, we conducted a laboratory experiment following a dictator game design to investigate the impact of crypto rewards in a more general scenario, with the crypto rewards specified as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The crypto rewards in Study II carry no monetary value but only serve to recognize donors symbolically. As such, the NFT thank-you gifts did not effectively induce people to donate; a traditional 1:1 donation matching strictly outperforms both the condition without thank-you gifts and the condition with NFT thank-you gifts. Nevertheless, the NFT thank-you gifts effectively increased the contribution sizes, conditional on the choice to give, when the NFT's graphic design primes donor identity and encompasses the charity recipient. |

Unlike normal loans, flash loans allow borrowers to borrow large assets without upfront collaterals deposits. Malicious adversaries use flash loans to gather large assets to exploit vulnerable DeFi protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for automated synthesis of adversarial transactions that exploit DeFi protocols using flash loans. To bypass the complexity of a DeFi protocol, we propose a new technique to approximate the DeFi protocol functional behaviors using numerical methods (polynomial linear regression and nearest-neighbor interpolation). We then construct an optimization query using the approximated functions of the DeFi protocol to find an adversarial attack constituted of a sequence of functions invocations with optimal parameters that gives the maximum profit. To improve the accuracy of the approximation, we propose a novel counterexample driven approximation refinement technique. We implement our framework in a tool named FlashSyn. We evaluate FlashSyn on 16 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash loan attacks and 2 DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges. FlashSyn automatically synthesizes an adversarial attack for 16 of the 18 benchmarks. Among the 16 successful cases, FlashSyn identifies attack vectors yielding higher profits than those employed by historical hackers in 3 cases, and also discovers multiple distinct attack vectors in 10 cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding possible flash loan attacks. |

Classical Byzantine agreements unavoidably face two major problems. One is $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, which means that the system to tolerate $f$ malicious players requires at least $3f+1$ players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical cryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with unconditional security to break this bound with nearly $1/2$ fault tolerance due to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures. \textcolor{black}{It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary to break the $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation, such as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work.} Our work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any number of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We experimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital ledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems and suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus networks. |

We study the ecosystem of the tokens and liquidity pools, highlighting analogies and differences between the two blockchains. We discover that about 60% of tokens are active for less than one day. Moreover, we find that 1% of addresses create an anomalous number of tokens (between 20% and 25%). We discover that these tokens are used as disposable tokens to perform a particular type of rug pull, which we call 1-day rug pull. We quantify the presence of this operation on both blockchains discovering its prevalence on the BNB Smart Chain. We estimate that 1-day rug pulls generated $240 million in profits. Finally, we present sniper bots, a new kind of trader bot involved in these activities, and we detect their presence and quantify their activity in the rug pull operations. |

However, in these systems, third parties are still involved in selling surplus energy. This results in increased cost of energy and there are many operational and security barriers in such systems. These issues can be solved by the decentralized distributed system of microgrids where a consumer can locally sell their surplus energy to another consumer. To deploy such a system, one must consider security barriers for the transaction of energy. This paper proposes a solution to these problems by devising a scheme as a marketplace where users interact with each other to buy and sell energy at better rates and get energy-generating resources on lease so that users do not have to worry about capital investment. Agreement between owner of resources and consumer is recorded on blockchain based smart contracts. In this paper, a survey is performed for existing well known, decentralized energy solutions. This paper also proposes an extra layer of security to leverage a shielded execution environment so that information of energy generated, utilized, and shared cannot be changed by consumers and third parties even if the system is compromised. |

Traditional FL heavily relies on a trusted centralized server. Although decentralized FL eliminates the central dependence, it may worsen the other inherit problems faced by FL such as poisoning attacks and data representation leakage due to insufficient restrictions on the behavior of participants, and heavy communication cost, especially in fully decentralized scenarios, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) settings. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fully decentralized P2P framework for FL, called BlockDFL. It takes blockchain as the foundation, leveraging the proposed PBFT-based voting mechanism and two-layer scoring mechanism to coordinate FL among peer participants without mutual trust, while effectively defending against poisoning attacks. Gradient compression is introduced to lowering communication cost and prevent data from being reconstructed from transmitted model updates. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets exhibit that BlockDFL obtains competitive accuracy compared to centralized FL and can defend poisoning attacks while achieving efficiency and scalability. Especially when the proportion of malicious participants is as high as 40%, BlockDFL can still preserve the accuracy of FL, outperforming existing fully decentralized P2P FL frameworks based on blockchain. |

They improve the latency of state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols by almost 2X and achieve optimal good-case complexity of O(n) by forgoing Reliable Broadcast as a building block.   Rather, Cordial Miners use the blocklace -- a partially-ordered counterpart of the totally-ordered blockchain data structure -- to implement the three algorithmic components of consensus: Dissemination, equivocation-exclusion, and ordering. |

This paper proposes a bodyless block propagation (BBP) scheme for which the blockbody is not validated and transmitted during block propagation, to increase TPS without compromising security. Nodes in the blockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next upcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated before the block is born. For a network with $N$ nodes, our theoretical analysis reveals that BBP can improve TPS scalability from $O(1/log(N))$ to $O(1)$ .   Ensuring consensus on the next block's transaction content is crucial. We propose a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization algorithm to drive this consensus. To address the undetermined Coinbase address issue, we further present an algorithm for such unresolvable transactions, ensuring a consistent and TPS-efficient scheme. With BBP, most transactions require neither validation nor transmission during block propagation, liberating system from transaction-block dependencies and rendering TPS scalable. Both theoretical analysis and experiments underscore BBP's potential for full TPS scalability. Experimental results reveal a 4x reduction in block propagation time compared to Ethereum blockchain, with TPS performance being limited by node hardware rather than block propagation. |

Recently, numerous new BFT algorithms have been proposed, not least due to the traction blockchain technologies have garnered in the search for consensus solutions that offer high throughput, low latency, and robust system designs. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of selected and distinguished BFT algorithms that have received extensive attention in academia and industry alike. We perform a qualitative comparison among all algorithms we review considering message and time complexities. Furthermore, we decompose each consensus algorithm into its constituent subprotocols for replication and view change backed by intuitive figures to illustrate the message-passing pattern. We also elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. |
|**2024-05-04**|**Light Clients for Lazy Blockchains**|Ertem Nusret Tas et.al.|[2203.15968](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15968)| Lazy blockchains decouple consensus from transaction verification and execution to increase throughput. Although they can contain invalid transactions (e.g., double spends) as a result, these can easily be filtered out by full nodes that check if there have been previous conflicting transactions. However, creating light (SPV) clients that do not see the whole transaction history becomes a challenge: A record of a transaction on the chain does not necessarily entail transaction confirmation. In this paper, we devise a protocol that enables the creation of efficient light clients for lazy blockchains. The number of interaction rounds and the communication complexity of our protocol are logarithmic in the blockchain execution time. Our construction is based on a bisection game that traverses the Merkle tree containing the ledger of all - valid or invalid - transactions. We prove that our proof system is succinct, complete and sound, and empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme. |

Specifically, we first design and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., to generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and to implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, learn the knowledge from data using the Deep Belief Network, and then share the knowledge learned from its data with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid the risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as excessive network overhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments clearly show that our proposed intrusion detection framework can achieve an accuracy of up to 98.6% in detecting attacks. |

Their decentralized nature, however, leads to notable volatility against traditional fiat currencies, making the task of accurately forecasting the crypto-fiat exchange rate complex. This study examines the various independent factors that affect the volatility of the Bitcoin-Dollar exchange rate. To this end, we propose CoMForE, a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble model, which not only utilizes historical trading data but also incorporates public sentiments from related tweets, public interest demonstrated by search volumes, and blockchain hash-rate data. Our developed model goes a step further by predicting fluctuations in the overall cryptocurrency value distribution, thus increasing its value for investment decision-making. We have subjected this method to extensive testing via comprehensive experiments, thereby validating the importance of multimodal combination over exclusive reliance on trading data. Further experiments show that our method significantly surpasses existing forecasting tools and methodologies, demonstrating a 19.29% improvement. This result underscores the influence of external independent factors on cryptocurrency volatility. |

This paper describes technical foundations, current applications, and some novel applications of zk-SNARKs. Regarding technical foundations, we go over the Quadratic Arithmetic Program reduction and the Pinocchio protocol. We then go over financial security applications like Zcash and Tornado Cash, and zk-Rollup applications like zkEVM and Darkforest. We propose novel zk-SNARK protocols for private auctions and decentralized card games on the blockchain, providing code for the proposed applications. We conclude by touching on promising zk-SNARK innovations, such as zk-STARKs. |
|**2023-12-04**|**More is Merrier: Relax the Non-Collusion Assumption in Multi-Server PIR**|Tiantian Gong et.al.|[2201.07740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07740)| A long line of research on secure computation has confirmed that anything that can be computed, can be computed securely using a set of non-colluding parties. Indeed, this non-collusion assumption makes a number of problems solvable, as well as reduces overheads and bypasses computational hardness results, and it is pervasive across different privacy-enhancing technologies. However, it remains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among computing parties. This work stems from an observation that if the number of available computing parties is much higher than the number of parties required to perform a secure computation task, collusion attempts in privacy-preserving computations could be deterred.   We focus on the prominent privacy-preserving computation task of multi-server $1$ -private information retrieval (PIR) that inherently assumes no pair-wise collusion. For PIR application scenarios, such as those for blockchain light clients, where the available servers can be plentiful, a single server's deviating action is not tremendously beneficial to itself. We can make deviations undesired via small amounts of rewards and penalties, thus significantly raising the bar for collusion resistance. We design and implement a collusion mitigation mechanism on a public bulletin board with payment execution functions, considering only rational and malicious parties with no honest non-colluding servers. Privacy protection is offered for an extended period after the query executions. |

Focusing on two fundamental aspects, transaction costs and deviations from the no-arbitrage condition, we estimate the causal effect of ``gas fees'' on DEX market quality. We show that these fixed costs impose a significant burden on relatively small trades and cause persistent arbitrage deviations. Conversely, DEXs offer more competitive transaction costs for larger trades, offering a more favorable environment for institutional investors. Furthermore, we provide causal evidence that innovations aimed at enhancing the flexibility of liquidity provision in DEX markets lead to sizeable improvements in market quality. |
|**2023-12-24**|**Two Sequential Squaring Verifiable Delay Function**|Souvik Sur et.al.|[2112.05997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05997)| A Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a function that takes a specified sequential time to be evaluated, but can be efficiently verified. VDFs are useful in several applications ranging from randomness beacons to sustainable blockchains but are really rare in practice. Most of the VDFs are based on algebraic assumptions like time-lock puzzle in unknown group orders [6, 8] and isogenies over pairing groups [4]. The number of modulo squaring required for verification in the time-lock puzzle based VDFs are proportional to their security parameter. This paper proposes a verifiable delay function that requires only 2- modulo squaring for verification. So the sequential effort required for verification is independent of the security parameter. |
|**2024-06-01**|**A Systematic Survey of Blockchained Federated Learning**|Zhilin Wang et.al.|[2110.02182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02182)| With the technological advances in machine learning, effective ways are available to process the huge amount of data generated in real life. However, issues of privacy and scalability will constrain the development of machine learning. Federated learning (FL) can prevent privacy leakage by assigning training tasks to multiple clients, thus separating the central server from the local devices. However, FL still suffers from shortcomings such as single-point-failure and malicious data. The emergence of blockchain provides a secure and efficient solution for the deployment of FL. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature on blockchained FL (BCFL). First, we investigate how blockchain can be applied to federal learning from the perspective of system composition. Then, we analyze the concrete functions of BCFL from the perspective of mechanism design and illustrate what problems blockchain addresses specifically for FL. We also survey the applications of BCFL in reality. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future research directions. |

Additionally, with the proposed proof-of-refundable-tax (PoRT) consensus algorithm, our approach can construct highly reliable, efficient, fair and stable blockchain operations. The PoRT algorithm adopts a verifiable random function instead of mining to select future block maintainers with the probability proportional to each participant's personal refundable tax. The individual refundable tax serves as an index of the activeness of participation and hence PoRT can effectively prevent Sybil attacks. Also, with the block-completion reward deducted from each maintainer's refundable tax, our blockchain system maintains a stable wealth distribution and avoids the "rich become richer" problem. We have implemented the approach and tested with very promising results. |

As a consequence, providing a clear unambiguous description of any activities carried out on blockchains has become crucial, and we feel the urgency to achieve that description at least for trading. This paper reports on how to leverage the \emph{Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services} ("\ONT{}") as a general means for the semantic representation of smart contracts stored on blockchain as software agents. Special attention is paid to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), whose management through the ERC721 standard is presented as a case study. |

This results in limitations on governance since elected candidates or policies are difficult to remove before the next elections, if needed, and allowed by the corresponding law. Participants may decide (through a public deliberation) to change their choices but have no opportunity to vote for these choices before the next elections. Another issue is the peak-end effect, where the judgment of voters is based on how they felt a short time before the elections. To address these issues, we propose Always on Voting (AoV) -- a repetitive voting framework that allows participants to vote and change elected candidates or policies without waiting for the next elections. Participants are permitted to privately change their vote at any point in time, while the effect of their change is manifested at the end of each epoch, whose duration is shorter than the time between two main elections. To thwart the problem of peak-end effect in epochs, the ends of epochs are randomized and made unpredictable, while preserved within soft bounds. These goals are achieved using the synergy between a Bitcoin puzzle oracle, verifiable delay function, and smart contracts. |

|**2023-12-22**|**Transaction Fee Mechanism Design**|Tim Roughgarden et.al.|[2106.01340](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01340)| Demand for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is far larger than supply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to include "on-chain" from the pool of all pending transactions. This paper investigates the problem of designing a blockchain transaction fee mechanism through the lens of mechanism design. We introduce two new forms of incentive-compatibility that capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting, one (MMIC) that protects against deviations by profit-maximizing miners and one (OCA-proofness) that protects against off-chain collusion between miners and users.   This study is immediately applicable to a recent (August 5, 2021) and major change to Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism, based on a proposal called "EIP-1559." Historically, Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism was a first-price (pay-as-bid) auction. EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly coupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a history-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of the transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive report card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden demand spike. We also introduce an alternative design, the "tipless mechanism," which offers an incomparable slate of incentive-compatibility guarantees -- it is MMIC and DSIC, and OCA-proof unless in the midst of a demand spike. |

However, traditional consensus mechanisms and architectures of blockchain systems face significant challenges in handling large-scale FL tasks, especially on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, due to their substantial resource consumption, limited transaction throughput, and complex communication requirements. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ChainFL, a novel two-layer blockchain-driven FL system. It splits the IoT network into multiple shards within the subchain layer, effectively reducing the scale of information exchange, and employs a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based mainchain as the mainchain layer, enabling parallel and asynchronous cross-shard validation. Furthermore, the FL procedure is customized to integrate deeply with blockchain technology, and a modified DAG consensus mechanism is designed to mitigate distortion caused by abnormal models. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation, multiple subchains based on Hyperledger Fabric and a self-developed DAG-based mainchain are deployed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChainFL significantly surpasses conventional FL systems, showing up to a 14% improvement in training efficiency and a threefold increase in robustness. |

In this paper, we begin with an overview of the different types and architectures of blockchain networks. Then, with a focus on consortium blockchains, we survey, classify, and assess their principal consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, as consensus mechanisms determine network reliability, enhance performance efficiency, and ensure system security, we conduct a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of consensus algorithms using a taxonomy of three different criteria: reliability, performance, and security. We conclude with insights into current and future research challenges and opportunities in this domain. |

We propose Blockchain-enabled Radio Access Networks, a novel decentralized RAN architecture enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency in authentication processes. BE-RAN leverages distributed ledger technology to establish trust, offering user-centric identity management, enabling mutual authentication, and facilitating on-demand point-to-point inter-network elements and UE-UE communication with accountable logging and billing service add-on for public network users, all without relying on centralized authorities. We envision a thoroughly decentralized RAN model and propose a privacy-preserving P2P communication approach that complements existing security measures while supporting the CSC paradigm. Results demonstrate BE-RAN significantly reduces communication and computation overheads, enhances privacy through decentralized identity management, and facilitates CSC integration, advancing towards more efficient and secure 6G networks. |

OSCs are ontological representations of smart contracts that allow to establish responsibilities and authorizations among agents and set agreements, whereas conditionals allow one to restrict and limit agent interactions, define activation mechanisms that trigger agent actions, and define constraints and contract terms on OSCs. Conditionals and OSCs, as defined in OASIS, are applied to extend with ontological capabilities digital public ledgers such as the blockchain and smart contracts implemented on it. We will also sketch the architecture of a framework based on the OASIS definition of OSCs that exploits the Ethereum platform and the Interplanetary File System. |

However, routing transactions comes at a cost which is proportional to the number of intermediaries, since each charges a fee for the routing service. Furthermore, analogous to other networks, malicious intermediaries in the payment path can lead to security and privacy threats. Virtual channels (VCs), i.e., bridges over PC paths, mitigate the above PCN issues, as an intermediary participates only once to set up the VC and is then excluded from every future VC transaction. However, similar to PCs, creating a VC has a cost that must be paid out of the bridged PCs' balance. Currently, we are missing guidelines to where and how many VCs to set up. Ideally, VCs should minimize transaction costs while mitigating security and privacy threats from on-path adversaries.   In this work, we address for the first time the VC setup problem, formalizing it as an optimization problem. We present an integer linear program (ILP) to compute the globally optimal VC setup strategy in terms of transaction costs, security, and privacy. We then accompany the computationally heavy ILP with a fast local greedy algorithm. Our model and algorithms can be used with any on-path adversary, given that its strategy can be expressed as a set of corrupted nodes that is estimated by the honest nodes. We conduct an evaluation of the greedy algorithm over a snapshot of the Lightning Network (LN), the largest Bitcoin-based PCN. Our results confirm on real-world data that our greedy strategy minimizes costs while protecting against security and privacy threats of on-path adversaries. These findings may serve the LN community as guidelines for the deployment of VCs. |

The scheme is a synthesis of blockchains, encrypted spread spectrum watermarks, perceptual hashing and digital signatures, which we call an Embedded Blockchain. Within this scheme, we use the blockchain for its data structure of a cryptographically linked list, cryptographic hashing for absolute comparisons, perceptual hashing for flexible comparisons, digital signatures for proof of ownership, and encrypted spread spectrum watermarking to embed the blockchain into the background noise of the media. So each media recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and segment-by-segment of the media. If any chain is broken, the difference in the computed and extracted perceptual hash is used to estimate the level of manipulation. |

Sami Ullah et.al.|[2004.06795](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06795)| Blockchain technology is one of the most contemporary and disruptive technologies in the world. It has gained considerable attention in numerous applications such as financial services, cybersecurity applications, Internet of Things (IoT), network data management. Now its range of applications is beyond the financial services as the healthcare industry has also adopted blockchain technology in its various subdomains such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical supply chain management system, genomic market, neuroscience technology, clinical research, and pharmaceutical medicine. Blockchain is considered a secure and viable solution for storing and accessing patients medical records and the patients can diagnosed and treated with safe and secure data sharing. Blockchain technology will revolutionize the healthcare systems with personalized, authentic, and secure access to the clinical data of patients and that data can be used for further health improvements and clinical researches. In this paper, we conduct a contemporary research on existing applications and developments in healthcare industry with the use of blockchain technology. We also discuss some robust applications and various existing companies that are using blockchain solutions for securing their data along with some current challenges and future perspectives. |
|**2024-06-03**|**A Review of Blockchain-based Smart Grid: Applications,Opportunities, and Future Directions**|H. Sami Ullah et.al.|[2002.05650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05650)| The Smart Grid (SG) concept presented an unprecedented opportunity to move the energy sector to more availability, reliability, and efficiency to improve our economic and environmental conditions. Renewable energy sources (Solar & Wind) are such technologies that are used in the smart grid to figure out the environmental and economic issues and challenges. Smart grids provide energy in different crowded sectors with the efficient and timely transmission of electricity. But the traditional power grids follow a centralized approach for energy transactions with a large number of growing connections and become more challenging to handle power disturbance in the grid. Blockchain as a decentralized and distributed technology provides promising applications in the smart grid infrastructure with its excellent and salient features. In this paper, we provide a concise review of blockchain architecture, concepts, and applications in smart grids. Different potential opportunities for blockchain technology with smart grids are also discussed. Some future directions concluded the paper. |

The goal in this paper is to solve the test oracle problem in a way that is general, scalable and accurate. To achieve this, we use supervised learning over test execution traces. We label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdict of pass or fail. We use the labelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn to distinguish runtime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a given program. Our approach for building this NN model involves the following steps, 1. Instrument the program to record execution traces as sequences of method invocations and global state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information in execution traces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the trace information for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification model on unseen execution traces from the program.   We evaluate our approach using case studies from different application domains: 1. Module from Ethereum Blockchain, 2. Module from PyTorch deep learning framework, 3. Microsoft SEAL encryption library components, 4. Sed stream editor, 5. Value pointer library and 6. Nine network protocols from Linux packet identifier, L7-Filter. We found the classification models for all subject programs resulted in high precision, recall and specificity, over 95%, while only training with an average 9% of the total traces. Our experiments show that the proposed neural network model is highly effective as a test oracle and is able to learn runtime patterns to distinguish passing and failing test executions for systems and tests from different application domains. |

With the increased amount of data duplication & accidental deletion of files on the Internet, the P2P file system called IPFS completely changes the way files are stored. IPFS is a file storage protocol allowing files to be stored on decentralized systems. In the HTTP client-server protocol, files are downloaded from a single source. With files stored on a decentralized network, IPFS allows packet retrieval from multiple sources, simultaneously saving considerable bandwidth. IPFS uses a content-addressed block storage model with content-addressed hyperlinks. Large amounts of data is addressable with IPFS with the immutable and permanent IPFS links with meta-data stored as Blockchain transactions. This timestamps and secures the data, instead of having to put it on the chain itself. Our paper proposes a model that uses the decentralized file storage system of IPFS, and the integrity preservation properties of the Blockchain, to store and distribute data on the Web. |

The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.   Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:   - an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium   - strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy   - PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum   - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies   - the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies   - the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment |

Due to its rapid and widespread diffusion, digital deception has not only an individual or societal cost (e.g., to hamper the integrity of elections), but it can lead to significant economic losses (e.g., to affect stock market performance) or to risks to national security. Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance, authenticity and traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure platform for storing and exchanging information. This overview aims to explore the potential of DLTs and blockchain to combat digital deception, reviewing initiatives that are currently under development and identifying their main current challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to face fake news, disinformation and deepfakes, as an integral part of strengthening the resilience against cyber-threats on today's online media. |

Fernandez-Carames et.al.|[1902.09604](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09604)| Industry 4.0 is a concept devised for improving the way modern factories operate through the use of some of the latest technologies, like the ones used for creating Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), robotics or Big Data applications. One of such technologies is blockchain, which is able to add trust, security and decentralization to different industrial fields. This article focuses on analyzing the benefits and challenges that arise when using blockchain and smart contracts to develop Industry 4.0 applications. In addition, this paper presents a thorough review on the most relevant blockchain-based applications for Industry 4.0 technologies. Thus, its aim is to provide a detailed guide for future Industry 4.0 developers that allows for determining how blockchain can enhance the next generation of cybersecure industrial applications. |

We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules.   In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures. |

This settlement latency slows cross-exchange trading, exposing arbitrageurs to price risk. Off-chain settlement, instead, exposes arbitrageurs to costly default risk. We show with Bitcoin network and order book data that cross-exchange price differences coincide with periods of high settlement latency, asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities, and price differences across exchanges with low default risk are smaller. Blockchain-based trading thus faces a dilemma: Reliable consensus protocols require time-consuming settlement latency, leading to arbitrage limits. Circumventing such arbitrage costs is possible only by reinstalling trusted intermediation, which mitigates default risk. |

For example, e-crime investigations of illegal Tor hidden services, such as Silk Road, often involve linking Bitcoin addresses, from which money is sent or received, to user accounts and related online activities. We present BlockTag, an open-source tagging system for blockchains that facilitates such tasks. We describe BlockTag's design and present three analyses that illustrate its capabilities in the context of privacy research and law enforcement. |
